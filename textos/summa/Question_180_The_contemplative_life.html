<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the contemplative life has nothing to do with the affections, and pertains wholly to the intellect?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the contemplative life has nothing to do with the affections and pertains wholly to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. ii, text. 3 [Ed Did. ia, 1) that "the end of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> pertains wholly to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore it would seem that the contemplative life wholly regards the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. vi, 37; Hom. xix in Ezech.) that "Rachel, which is interpreted 'vision of the principle' [Or rather, 'One seeing the principle,' if derived from <em>rah</em> and <em>irzn</em>; Cf. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, De Nom. Hebr.], signifies the contemplative life." Now the vision of a principle belongs properly to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore the contemplative life belongs properly to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xiv in Ezech.) that it belongs to the contemplative life, "to rest from external action." Now the affective or <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power inclines to external actions. Therefore it would seem that the contemplative life has nothing to do with the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xiv in Ezech.) that "the contemplative life is to cling with our whole mind to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and our neighbor, and to desire nothing beside our Creator." Now desire and love pertain to the affective or <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, as stated above (I-II, 25, 2; I-II, 26, 2). Therefore the contemplative life has also something to do with the affective or <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 179, Article 1) theirs is said to be the contemplative who are chiefly intent on the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as stated above (I-II, 12, 1), because <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is of the end which is the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Consequently the contemplative life, as regards the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the action, pertains to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, but as regards the motive <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the exercise of that action it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which moves all the other powers, even the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, to their actions, as stated above (I, 82, 4; I-II, 09, 1).

<p>Now the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power moves one to observe things either with the senses or with the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, sometimes for love of the thing seen because, as it is written (<a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse21">Matthew 6:21</a>), "where thy treasure is, there is thy heart also," sometimes for love of the very <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that one acquires by observation. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> makes the contemplative life to consist in the "love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," inasmuch as through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> we are aflame to gaze on His beauty. And since everyone delights when he obtains what he loves, it follows that the contemplative life terminates in delight, which is seated in the affective power, the result being that love also becomes more intense.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> From the very fact that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is the end of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, it has the aspect of an appetible <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, both lovable and delightful, and in this respect it pertains to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> We are urged to the vision of the first principle, namely <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by the love thereof; wherefore <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xiv in Ezech.) that "the contemplative life tramples on all cares and longs to see the face of its Creator."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power moves not only the bodily members to perform external actions, but also the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to practice the act of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, as stated above.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the moral virtues pertain to the contemplative life?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> pertain to the contemplative life. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xiv in Ezech.) that "the contemplative life is to cling to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and our neighbor with the whole mind." Now all the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, since their acts are prescribed by the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, are reducible to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of our neighbor, for "love . . . is the fulfilling of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse1">Romans 13:1</a>)0). Therefore it would seem that the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> belong to the contemplative life.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the contemplative life is chiefly directed to the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xiv in Ezech.) that "the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> tramples on all cares and longs to gaze on the face of its Creator." Now no one can accomplish this without cleanness of heart, which is a result of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> [Cf. 08, 07]. For it is written (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse8">Matthew 5:8</a>): "Blessed are the clean of heart, for they shall see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>": and (<a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse14">Hebrews 12:14</a>): "Follow peace with all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, without which no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore it would seem that the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> pertain to the contemplative life.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xiv in Ezech.) that "the contemplative life gives beauty to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>," wherefore it is signified by Rachel, of whom it is said (<a href="../bible/gen029.htm#verse17">Genesis 29:17</a>) that she was "of a beautiful countenance." Now the beauty of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> consists in the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, especially <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, as <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Offic. i, 43,45,46). Therefore it seems that the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> pertain to the contemplative life.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are directed to external actions. Now <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. vi [Hom. xiv in Ezech.; Cf. 1, Objection 3) that it belongs to the contemplative life "to rest from external action." Therefore the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> do not pertain to the contemplative life.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing may belong to the contemplative life in two ways, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> or dispositively. The moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> do not belong to the contemplative life <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, because the end of the contemplative life is the consideration of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: and as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. ii, 4), "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>," which pertains to the consideration of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, "has little influence on the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>": wherefore he declares (Ethic. x, 8) that the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> pertain to active but not to contemplative <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.

<p>On the other hand, the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> belong to the contemplative life dispositively. For the act of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, wherein the contemplative life <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> consists, is hindered both by the impetuosity of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> which withdraw the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> from intelligible to sensible things, and by outward disturbances. Now the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> curb the impetuosity of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, and quell the disturbance of outward occupations. Hence moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> belong dispositively to the contemplative life.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), the contemplative life has its motive <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> on the part of the affections, and in this respect the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and our neighbor is requisite to the contemplative life. Now motive <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> do not enter into the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of a thing, but dispose and perfect it. Wherefore it does not follow that the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> belong <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> to the contemplative life.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Holiness or cleanness of heart is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> that are concerned with the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> which hinder the purity of the reason; and peace is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> which is about operations, according to <a href="../bible/isa032.htm#verse17">Isaiah 32:17</a>, "The work of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> shall be peace": since he who refrains from wronging others lessens the occasions of quarrels and disturbances. Hence the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> dispose one to the contemplative life by <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> peace and cleanness of heart.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Beauty, as stated above (Question 145, Article 2), consists in a certain clarity and due proportion. Now each of these is found radically in the reason; because both the light that makes beauty seen, and the establishing of due proportion among things belong to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Hence since the contemplative life consists in an act of the reason, there is beauty in it by its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/wis008.htm#verse2">Wisdom 8:2</a>) of the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of wisdom: "I became a lover of her beauty."

<p>On the other hand, beauty is in the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> by participation, in so far as they participate in the order of reason; and especially is it in <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, which restrains the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a> which especially darken the light of reason. Hence it is that the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> most of all makes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> apt for <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, since venereal pleasures most of all weigh the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> down to sensible objects, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Soliloq. i, 10).

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether there are various actions pertaining to the contemplative life?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there are various actions pertaining to the contemplative life. For <a href="../cathen/13045c.htm">Richard of St. Victor</a> [De Grat. Contempl. i, 3,4 distinguishes between "<a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>," "meditation," and "cogitation." Yet all these apparently pertain to <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>. Therefore it would seem that there are various actions pertaining to the contemplative life.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse18">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>): "But we . . . beholding [speculantes] the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord with open face, are transformed into the same clarity [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'into the same image from <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.']." Now this belongs to the contemplative life. Therefore in addition to the three aforesaid, vision [speculatio] belongs to the contemplative life.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">Bernard</a> says (De Consid. v, 14) that "the first and greatest <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> is admiration of the Majesty." Now according to <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. ii, 15) admiration is a kind of fear. Therefore it would seem that several acts are requisite for the contemplative life.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, "<a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a>," "reading," and "meditation" [<a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugh of St. Victor</a>, Alleg. in N.T. iii, 4 are said to belong to the contemplative life. Again, "hearing" belongs to the contemplative life: since it is stated that Mary (by whom the contemplative life is signified) "sitting . . . at the Lord's feet, heard His word" (<a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse39">Luke 10:39</a>). Therefore it would seem that several acts are requisite for the contemplative life.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Life signifies here the operation on which a man is chiefly intent. Wherefore if there are several operations of the contemplative life, there will be, not one, but several contemplative lives.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We are now speaking of the contemplative life as applicable to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Now according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. vii) between <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> there is this difference, that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> perceives the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by simple apprehension, whereas <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> arrives at the perception of a simple <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by a process from several premises. Accordingly, then, the contemplative life has one act wherein it is finally completed, namely the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and from this act it derives its unity. Yet it has many acts whereby it arrives at this final act. Some of these pertain to the reception of principles, from which it proceeds to the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; others are concerned with deducing from the principles, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of which is sought; and the last and crowning act is the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> itself of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/13045c.htm">Richard of St. Victor</a> "cogitation" would seem to regard the consideration of the many things from which a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> intends to gather one simple <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Hence cogitation may comprise not only the perceptions of the senses in taking cognizance of certain effects, but also the imaginations. and again the reason's discussion of the various signs or of anything that conduces to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in view: although, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. xiv, 7), cogitation may signify any actual operation of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. "Meditation" would seem to be the process of reason from certain principles that lead to the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of some <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: and "consideration" has the same meaning, according to <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">Bernard</a> (De Consid. ii, 2), although, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Anima ii, 1), every operation of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> may be called "consideration." But "<a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>" regards the simple act of gazing on the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; wherefore Richard says again (De Grat. Contempl. i, 4) that "<a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> clear and free dwelling upon the object of its gaze; meditation is the survey of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> while occupied in searching for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: and cogitation is the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind's</a> glance which is prone to wander."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> According to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> [Cf. De Trin. xv, 8 of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> on this passage, "beholding" [speculatio] denotes "seeing in a mirror [speculo], not from a watch-tower [specula]." Now to see a thing in a mirror is to see a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> in its effect wherein its likeness is reflected. Hence "beholding" would seem to be reducible to meditation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Admiration is a kind of fear resulting from the apprehension of a thing that surpasses our faculties: hence it results from the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the sublime <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For it was stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>) that <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> terminates in the affections.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Man reaches the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in two ways. First, by means of things received from another. On this way, as regards the things he receives from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he needs "<a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>," according to (<a href="../bible/wis007.htm#verse7">Wisdom 7:7</a>), "I called upon" <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, "and the spirit of wisdom came upon me": while as regards the things he receives from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, he needs "hearing," in so far as he receives from the spoken word, and "reading," in so far as he receives from the tradition of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>. Secondly, he needs to apply himself by his personal study, and thus he requires "meditation."

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the contemplative life consists in the mere contemplation of God, or also in the consideration of any truth whatever?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the contemplative life consists not only in the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but also in the consideration of any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/psa138.htm#verse14">Psalm 138:14</a>): "Wonderful are Thy works, and my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> right well." Now the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> works is effected by any <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Therefore it would seem that it pertains to the contemplative life to contemplate not only the divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but also any other.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">Bernard</a> says (De Consid. v, 14) that "<a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> consists in admiration first of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> majesty, secondly of His judgments, thirdly of His benefits, fourthly of His promises." Now of these four the first alone regards the divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the other three pertain to His effects. Therefore the contemplative life consists not only in the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but also in the consideration of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> regarding the divine effects.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/13045c.htm">Richard of St. Victor</a> [De Grat. Contempl. i, 6 distinguishes six <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>. The first belongs to "the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> alone," and consists in thinking of corporeal things. The second is in "the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> guided by reason," and consists in considering the order and disposition of sensible objects. The third is in "the reason based on the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>"; when, to wit, from the consideration of the visible we rise to the invisible. The fourth is in "the reason and conducted by the reason," when the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is intent on things invisible of which the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> has no cognizance. The fifth is "above the reason," but not contrary to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, when by <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">divine revelation</a> we become cognizant of things that cannot be comprehended by the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. The sixth is "above reason and contrary to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>"; when, to wit, by the divine enlightening we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> things that seem contrary to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, such as the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>. Now only the last of these would seem to pertain to the divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> regards not only the divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but also that which is considered in creatures.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, in the contemplative life the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is sought as being the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Now any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is a perfection of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore the contemplative life consists in the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. vi, 37) that "in <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> we seek the principle which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), a thing may belong to the contemplative life in two ways: principally, and secondarily, or dispositively. That which belongs principally to the contemplative life is the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, because this <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> is the end of the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. i, 8) that "the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is promised us as being the goal of all our actions and the everlasting perfection of our <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joys</a>." This <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> will be perfect in the life to come, when we shall see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> face to face, wherefore it will make us perfectly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>: whereas now the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is competent to us imperfectly, namely "through a glass" and "in a dark manner" (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse1">1 Corinthians 13:1</a>)2). Hence it bestows on us a certain inchoate beatitude, which begins now and will be continued in the life to come; wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. x, 7) places <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> ultimate <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the supreme intelligible <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p>Since, however, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> effects show us the way to the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, according to (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse20">Romans 1:20</a>), "The invisible things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> . . . are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made," it follows that the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the divine effects also belongs to the contemplative life, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is guided thereby to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Vera Relig. xxix) that "in the study of creatures we must not exercise an empty and futile curiosity, but should make them the stepping-stone to things unperishable and everlasting."

<p>Accordingly it is clear from what has been said (1 and 2,3) that four things pertain, in a certain order, to the contemplative life; first, the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; secondly, other acts exclusive of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>; thirdly, <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the divine effects; fourthly, the complement of all which is the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> David sought the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> works, so that he might be led by them to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; wherefore he says elsewhere (<a href="../bible/psa142.htm#verse5">Psalm 142:5-6</a>): "I meditated on all Thy works: I meditated upon the works of Thy hands: I stretched forth my hands to Thee."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> By considering the divine judgments <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is guided to the consideration of the divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; and by considering the divine benefits and promises, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is led to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> mercy or <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, as by effects already manifested or yet to be vouchsafed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> These six denote the steps whereby we ascend by means of creatures to the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the first step consists in the mere consideration of sensible objects; the second step consists in going forward from sensible to intelligible objects; the third step is to judge of sensible objects according to intelligible things; the fourth is the absolute consideration of the intelligible objects to which one has attained by means of sensibles; the fifth is the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of those intelligible objects that are unattainable by means of sensibles, but which the reason is able to grasp; the sixth step is the consideration of such intelligible things as the reason can neither discover nor grasp, which pertain to the sublime <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, wherein <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> is ultimately perfected.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The ultimate perfection of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: and other <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> perfect the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in relation to the divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether in the present state of life the contemplative life can reach to the vision of the Divine essence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in the present state of life the contemplative life can reach to the vision of the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. For, as stated in <a href="../bible/gen032.htm#verse30">Genesis 32:30</a>, <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> said: "I have seen <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> face to face, and my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has been saved." Now the vision of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> face is the vision of the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Therefore it would seem that in the present life one may come, by means of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. vi, 37) that "contemplative men withdraw within themselves in order to explore <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, nor do they ever carry with them the shadows of things corporeal, or if these follow them they prudently drive them away: but being desirous of seeing the incomprehensible light, they suppress all the images of their limited comprehension, and through longing to reach what is above them, they overcome that which they are." Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not hindered from seeing the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, which is the incomprehensible light, save by the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of turning to corporeal phantasms. Therefore it would seem that the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the present life can extend to the vision of the incomprehensible light in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Dial. ii, 35): "All creatures are small to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that sees its Creator: wherefore when the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," the blessed Benedict, to wit, "saw a fiery globe in the tower and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> returning to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> he could only see such things by the light of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Now the blessed Benedict was still in this life. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the present life can extend to the vision of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xiv in Ezech.): "As long as we live in this mortal flesh, no one reaches such a height of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> as to fix the eyes of his mind on the ray itself of incomprehensible light."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 27), "no one seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> lives this mortal life wherein the bodily senses have their play: and unless in some way he depart this life, whether by going altogether out of his body, or by withdrawing from his carnal senses, he is not caught up into that vision." This has been carefully discussed above (175, 4 and 5), where we spoke of <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a>, and in I, 12, 2, where we treated of the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a>.

<p>Accordingly we must state that one may be in this life in two ways. First, with regard to act, that is to say by actually making use of the bodily senses, and thus <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> in the present life can nowise attain to the vision of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Secondly, one may be in this life <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a> and not with regard to act, that is to say, when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united to the mortal body as its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, yet so as to make use neither of the bodily senses, nor even of the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, as happens in rapture; and in this way the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the present life can attain to the vision of the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Consequently the highest degree of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> in the present life is that which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> had in <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a>, whereby he was in a middle state between the present life and the life to come.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Ep. i ad Caium. Monach.), "if anyone seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, understood what he saw, he saw not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, but something belonging to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." And <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xiv in Ezech.): "By no means is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> seen now in His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; but the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> sees something of lower degree, and is thereby refreshed so that afterwards it may attain to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of vision." Accordingly the words of <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, "I saw <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> face to face" do not imply that he saw <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, but that he saw some shape [Cf. I, 12, 11, ad 1, <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> of course, wherein <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> spoke to him. Or, "since we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> a man by his face, by the face of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> he signified his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Him," according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> on the same passage.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In the present state of life <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> is impossible without phantasms, because it is connatural to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to see the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in the phantasms, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (De Anima iii, 7). Yet <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> does not consist in the phantasms themselves, but in our contemplating in them the purity of the intelligible <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: and this not only in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but also in that which we obtain by <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>. For <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. i) that "the Divine <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> shows us the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> hierarchies under certain symbolic figures, and by its power we are brought back to the single ray of light," i.e. to the simple <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the intelligible <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. It is in this sense that we must understand the statement of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> that "contemplatives do not carry along with them the shadows of things corporeal," since their <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> is not fixed on them, but on the consideration of the intelligible <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> By these words <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> does not imply that the blessed Benedict, in that vision, saw <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, but he wishes to show that because "all creatures are small to him that sees <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," it follows that all things can easily be seen through the enlightenment of the Divine light. Wherefore he adds: "For however little he may see of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator's</a> light, all <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things become petty to him."

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the operation of contemplation is fittingly divided into a threefold movement, circular, straight and oblique?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the operation of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> is unfittingly divided into a threefold movement, "circular," "straight," and "oblique" (Div. Nom. iv). For <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> pertains exclusively to rest, according to (<a href="../bible/wis008.htm#verse1">Wisdom 8:1</a>)6, "When I go into my house, I shall repose myself with her." Now movement is opposed to rest. Therefore the operations of the contemplative life should not be described as movements.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the action of the contemplative life pertains to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is like the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> describes these movements as being different in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> from what they are in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For he says (Div. Nom. iv) that the "circular" movement in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is "according to his enlightenment by the beautiful and the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." On the other hand, he assigns the circular movement of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to several things: the first of which is the "withdrawal of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> into itself from externals"; the second is "a certain concentration of its powers, whereby it is rendered free of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and of outward occupation"; and the third is "union with those things that are above it." Again, he describes differently their respective straight movements. For he says that the straight movement of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is that by which he proceeds to the care of those things that are beneath him. On the other hand, he describes the straight movement of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as being twofold: first, "its progress towards things that are near it"; secondly, "its uplifting from external things to simple <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>." Further, he assigns a different oblique movement to each. For he assigns the oblique movement of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to the fact that "while providing for those who have less they remain unchanged in relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>": whereas he assigns the oblique movement of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the fact that "the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is enlightened in Divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by reasoning and discoursing." Therefore it would seem that the operations of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> are unfittingly assigned according to the ways mentioned above.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/13045c.htm">Richard of St. Victor</a> (De Contempl. i, 5) mentions many other different movements in likeness to the birds of the air. "For some of these rise at one time to a great height, at another swoop down to earth, and they do so repeatedly; others fly now to the right, now to the left again and again; others go forwards or lag behind many times; others fly in a circle now more now less extended; and others remain suspended almost immovably in one place." Therefore it would seem that there are only three movements of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> stands the authority of <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. iv).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (119, 1, ad 3), the operation of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, wherein <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> consists, is called a movement, in so far as movement is the act of a perfect thing, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Anima iii, 1). Since, however, it is through sensible objects that we come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of intelligible things, and since sensible operations do not take place without movement, the result is that even intelligible operations are described as movements, and are differentiated in likeness to various movements. Now of bodily movements, local movements are the most perfect and come first, as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in Phys. viii, 7; wherefore the foremost among intelligible operations are described by being likened to them. These movements are of three kinds; for there is the "circular" movement, by which a thing moves uniformly round one point as center, another is the "straight" movement, by which a thing goes from one point to another; the third is "oblique," being composed as it were of both the others. Consequently, in intelligible operations, that which is simply uniform is compared to circular movement; the intelligible operation by which one proceeds from one point to another is compared to the straight movement; while the intelligible operation which unites something of uniformity with progress to various points is compared to the oblique movement.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> External bodily movements are opposed to the quiet of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, which consists in rest from outward occupations: but the movements of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> operations belong to the quiet of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> is like the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> generically, but the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> power is much higher in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> than in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Consequently these movements must be ascribed to <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in different ways, according as they are differently related to uniformity. For the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> has uniform <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in two respects. First, because it does not acquire intelligible <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from the variety of composite objects; secondly, because it understands the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of intelligible objects not discursively, but by simple intuition. On the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> acquires intelligible <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from sensible objects, and understands it by a certain discoursing of the reason.

<p>Wherefore <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> assigns the "circular" movement of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to the fact that their intuition of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is uniform and unceasing, having neither beginning nor end: even as a circular movement having neither beginning nor end is uniformly around the one same center. But on the part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, ere it arrive at this uniformity, its twofold lack of uniformity needs to be removed. First, that which arises from the variety of external things: this is removed by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> withdrawing from externals, and so the first thing he mentions regarding the circular movement of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is "the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> withdrawal into itself from external objects." Secondly, another lack of uniformity requires to be removed from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and this is owing to the discoursing of reason. This is done by directing all the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> operations to the simple <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the intelligible <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and this is indicated by his saying in the second place that "the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> powers must be uniformly concentrated," in other words that discoursing must be laid aside and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> gaze fixed on the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the one simple <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. On this operation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> there is no <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, even as there is clearly no <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in the understanding of first principles which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by simple intuition. Afterwards these two things being done, he mentions thirdly the uniformity which is like that of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, for then all things being laid aside, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> continues in the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. This he expresses by saying: "Then being thus made uniform unitedly," i.e. conformably, "by the union of its powers, it is conducted to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and the beautiful." The "straight" movement of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> cannot apply to his proceeding from one thing to another by considering them, but only to the order of his <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, namely to the fact that the higher <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> enlightens the lower <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> through the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> that are intermediate. He indicates this when he says: "The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> movement takes a straight line when he proceeds to the care of things subject to him, taking in his course whatever things are direct," i.e. in keeping with the dispositions of the direct order. Whereas he ascribes the "straight" movement in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> proceeding from exterior sensibles to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of intelligible objects. The "oblique" movement in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> he describes as being composed of the straight and circular movements, inasmuch as their care for those beneath them is in accordance with their <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: while the "oblique" movement in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> he also declares to be partly straight and partly circular, in so far as in reasoning it makes use of the light received from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> These varieties of movement that are taken from the distinction between above and below, right and left, forwards and backwards, and from varying circles, are all comprised under either straight and oblique movement, because they all denote discursions of reason. For if the reason pass from the genus to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, or from the part to the whole, it will be, as he explains, from above to below: if from one opposite to another, it will be from right to left; if from the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to the effect, it will be backwards and forwards; if it be about <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> that surround a thing near at hand or far remote, the movement will be circular. The discoursing of reason from sensible to intelligible objects, if it be according to the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, belongs to the straight movement; but if it be according to the Divine enlightenment, it will belong to the oblique movement as explained above (ad 2). That alone which he describes as immobility belongs to the circular movement.

<p>Wherefore it is evident that <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> describes the movement of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> with much greater fulness and depth.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether there is delight in contemplation?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is no delight in <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>. For delight belongs to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power; whereas <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> resides chiefly in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore it would seem that there is no delight in <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, all strife and struggle is a hindrance to delight. Now there is strife and struggle in <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xiv in Ezech.) that "when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> strives to contemplate <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is in a state of struggle; at one time it almost overcomes, because by understanding and feeling it tastes something of the incomprehensible light, and at another time it almost succumbs, because even while tasting, it fails." Therefore there is no delight in <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, delight is the result of a perfect operation, as stated in Ethic. x, 4. Now the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of wayfarers is imperfect, according to (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse1">1 Corinthians 13:1</a>)2, "We see now through a glass in a dark manner." Therefore seemingly there is no delight in the contemplative life.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, a lesion of the body is an obstacle to delight. Now <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a lesion of the body; wherefore it is stated (<a href="../bible/gen032.htm">Genesis 32</a>) that after <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> had said (<a href="../bible/gen032.htm#verse30">Genesis 32:30</a>), "'I have seen <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> face to face' . . . he halted on his foot (<a href="../bible/gen032.htm#verse31">Genesis 32:31</a>) . . . because he touched the sinew of his thigh and it shrank" (<a href="../bible/gen032.htm#verse32">Genesis 32:32</a>). Therefore seemingly there is no delight in <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written of the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of wisdom (<a href="../bible/wis008.htm#verse1">Wisdom 8:1</a>)6): "Her conversation hath no bitterness, nor her company any tediousness, but <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">gladness</a>": and <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xiv in Ezech.) that "the contemplative life is sweetness exceedingly lovable."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There may be delight in any particular <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> in two ways. First by reason of the operation itself [Cf. I-II, 03, 5, because each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> delights in the operation which befits him according to his own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> befits a man according to his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as a rational animal: the result being that "all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> desire to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>," so that consequently they delight in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And more delightful still does this become to one who has the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, the result of which is that he contemplates without difficulty. Secondly, <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> may be delightful on the part of its object, in so far as one contemplates that which one loves; even as bodily vision gives pleasure, not only because to see is pleasurable in itself, but because one sees a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> whom one loves. Since, then, the contemplative life consists chiefly in the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of which <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is the motive, as stated above (1 and 2, ad 1), it follows that there is delight in the contemplative life, not only by reason of the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> itself, but also by reason of the Divine love.

<p>In both respects the delight thereof surpasses all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> delight, both because <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> delight is greater than carnal pleasure, as stated above (I-II, 31, 5), when we were treating of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, and because the love whereby <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is loved out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> surpasses all love. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/psa033.htm#verse9">Psalm 33:9</a>): "O taste and see that the Lord is sweet."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although the contemplative life consists chiefly in an act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, it has its beginning in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, since it is through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> that one is urged to the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And since the end corresponds to the beginning, it follows that the term also and the end of the contemplative life has its being in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, since one delights in seeing the object loved, and the very delight in the object seen arouses a yet greater love. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xiv in Ezech.) that "when we see one whom we love, we are so aflame as to love him more." And this is the ultimate perfection of the contemplative life, namely that the Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> be not only seen but also loved.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Strife or struggle arising from the opposition of an external thing, hinders delight in that thing. For a man delights not in a thing against which he strives: but in that for which he strives; when he has obtained it, other things being equal, he delights yet more: wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. viii, 3) that "the more peril there was in the battle, the greater the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in the triumph." But there is no strife or struggle in <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> on the part of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which we contemplate, though there is on the part of our defective understanding and our corruptible body which drags us down to lower things, according to (<a href="../bible/wis009.htm#verse15">Wisdom 9:15</a>), "The corruptible body is a load upon the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and the earthly habitation presseth down the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> that museth upon many things." Hence it is that when <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> attains to the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, he loves it yet more, while he <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> the more his own deficiency and the weight of his corruptible body, so as to say with the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse2">Romans 7:2</a>)4): "Unhappy <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" Wherefore <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> say (Hom. xiv in Ezech.): "When <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is once <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by desire and understanding, He withers all carnal pleasure in us."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in this life is imperfect in comparison with the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>; and in like manner the delight of the wayfarer's <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> is imperfect as compared with the delight of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, of which it is written (<a href="../bible/psa035.htm#verse9">Psalm 35:9</a>): "Thou shalt make them drink of the torrent of Thy pleasure." Yet, though the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of Divine things which is to be had by wayfarers is imperfect, it is more delightful than all other <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> however perfect, on account of the excellence of that which is contemplated. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Part. Animal. i, 5): "We may happen to have our own little theories about those sublime beings and godlike <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, and though we grasp them but feebly, nevertheless so elevating is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that they give us more delight than any of those things that are round about us": and <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says in the same sense (Hom. xiv in Ezech.): "The contemplative life is sweetness exceedingly lovable; for it carries the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> away above itself, it opens <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and discovers the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> world to the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> After <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> halted with one foot, "because we need to grow weak in the love of the world ere we wax strong in the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xiv in Ezech.). "Thus when we have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the sweetness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we have one foot sound while the other halts; since every one who halts on one foot leans only on that foot which is sound."

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether the contemplative life is continuous?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the contemplative life is not continuous. For the contemplative life consists <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> in things pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Now all the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> perfections of this life will be made void, according to (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse8">1 Corinthians 13:8</a>), "Whether <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophecies</a> shall be made void, or tongues shall cease, or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> shall be destroyed." Therefore the contemplative life is made void.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a man tastes the sweetness of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> by snatches and for a short time only: wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. x, 40), "Thou admittest me to a most unwonted affection in my inmost <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, to a strange sweetness . . . yet through my grievous weight I sink down again." Again, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> commenting on the words of <a href="../bible/job004.htm#verse15">Job 4:15</a>, "When a spirit passed before me," says (Moral. v, 33): "The mind does not remain long at rest in the sweetness of inward <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, for it is recalled to itself and beaten back by the very immensity of the light." Therefore the contemplative life is not continuous.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that which is not connatural to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot be continuous. Now the contemplative life, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. x, 7), "is better than the life which is according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." Therefore seemingly the contemplative life is not continuous.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse42">Luke 10:42</a>): "Mary hath chosen the best part, which shall not be taken away from her," since as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xiv in Ezech.), "the contemplative life begins here so that it may be perfected in our heavenly home."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing may be described as continuous in two ways: first, in regard to its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; secondly, in regard to us. It is evident that in regard to itself contemplative life is continuous for two reasons: first, because it is about incorruptible and unchangeable things; secondly, because it has no contrary, for there is nothing contrary to the pleasure of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, as stated in Topic. i, 13. But even in our regard contemplative life is continuous--both because it is competent to us in respect of the incorruptible part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, namely the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, wherefore it can endure after this life--and because in the works of the contemplative life we work not with our bodies, so that we are the more able to persevere in the works thereof, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> observes (Ethic. x, 7).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The manner of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> is not the same here as in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: yet the contemplative life is said to remain by reason of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, wherein it has both its beginning and its end. <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> speaks in this sense (Hom. xiv in Ezech.): "The contemplative life begins here, so as to be perfected in our heavenly home, because the fire of love which begins to burn here is aflame with a yet greater love when we see Him Whom we love."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> No action can last long at its highest pitch. Now the highest point of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> is to reach the uniformity of Divine <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> [Cf. Coel. Hier. iii], and as we have stated above (6, ad 2). Hence although <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> cannot last long in this respect, it can be of long duration as regards the other contemplative acts.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> declares the contemplative life to be above <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, because it befits us "so far as there is in us something divine" (Ethic. x, 7), namely the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which is incorruptible and impassible in itself, wherefore its act can endure longer.
