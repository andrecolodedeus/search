<h1>Question 181. The active life</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3181.htm#article1"> Do all the works of the moral virtues pertain to the active life?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3181.htm#article2"> Does prudence pertain to the active life?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3181.htm#article3"> Does teaching pertain to the active life?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3181.htm#article4"> The duration of the active life</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether all the actions of the moral virtues pertain to the active life?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the acts of the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> do not all pertain to the active life. For seemingly the active life regards only our relations with other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>: hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xiv in Ezech.) that "the active life is to give bread to the hungry," and after mentioning many things that regard our relations with other people he adds finally, "and to give to each and every one whatever he needs." Now we are directed in our relations to others, not by all the acts of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, but only by those of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and its parts, as stated above (58, 2 and 8; I-II, 60, 2 and 3). Therefore the acts of the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> do not all pertain to the active life.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xiv in Ezech.) that Lia who was blear-eyed but fruitful signifies the active life: which "being occupied with work, sees less, and yet since it urges one's neighbor both by word and example to its imitation it begets a numerous offspring of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>." Now this would seem to belong to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, whereby we love our neighbor, rather than to the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Therefore seemingly the acts of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> do not pertain to the active life.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as stated above (Question 180, Article 2), the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> dispose one to the contemplative life. Now disposition and perfection belong to the same thing. Therefore it would seem that the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> do not pertain to the active life.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (De Summo Bono iii, 15): "In the active life all <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> must first of all be extirpated by the practice of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works, in order that in the contemplative life the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind's</a> eye being purified one may advance to the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the Divine light." Now all <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are not extirpated save by acts of the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Therefore the acts of the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> pertain to the active life.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 179, Article 1) the active and the contemplative life differ according to the different occupations of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> intent on different ends: one of which occupations is the consideration of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; and this is the end of the contemplative life, while the other is external work to which the active life is directed.

<p>Now it is evident that the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are directed chiefly, not to the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> but to operation. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 4) that "for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is of little or no avail." Hence it is clear that the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> belong <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> to the active life; for which reason the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. x, 8) subordinates the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> to active <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The chief of the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> by which one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is directed in his relations towards another, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proves (Ethic. v, 1). Hence the active life is described with reference to our relations with other people, because it consists in these things, not exclusively, but principally.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is possible, by the acts of all the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, for one to direct one's neighbor to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by example: and this is what <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> here ascribes to the active life.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Even as the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that is directed to the end of another <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> passes, as it were, into the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the latter <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, so again when a man makes use of things pertaining to the active life, merely as dispositions to <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, such things are comprised under the contemplative life. On the other hand, when we practice the works of the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as being <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in themselves, and not as dispositions to the contemplative life, the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> belong to the active life.

<p>It may also be replied, however, that the active life is a disposition to the contemplative life.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether prudence pertains to the active life?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> does not pertain to the active life. For just as the contemplative life belongs to the cognitive power, so the active life belongs to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power. Now <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> belongs not to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> but to the cognitive power. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> does not belong to the active life.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xiv in Ezech.) that the "active life being occupied with work, sees less," wherefore it is signified by Lia who was blear-eyed. But <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> requires clear eyes, so that one may judge aright of what has to be done. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> does not pertain to the active life.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> stands between the moral and the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Now just as the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> belong to the active life, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), so do the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> pertain to the contemplative life. Therefore it would seem that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> pertains neither to the active nor to the contemplative life, but to an intermediate kind of life, of which <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> makes mention (De Civ. Dei xix, 2,3,19).

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. x, 8) that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> pertains to active <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, to which the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> belong.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1, ad 3; I-II, 18, 6), if one thing be directed to another as its end, it is drawn, especially in moral matters, to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the thing to which it is directed: for instance "he who commits <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> that he may steal, is a <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a> rather than an adulterer," according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. v, 2). Now it is evident that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is directed to the works of the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> as its end, since it is "right reason applied to action" (Ethic. vi, 5); so that the ends of the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are the principles of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says in the same book. Accordingly, as it was stated above (1, ad 3) that the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in one who directs them to the quiet of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> belong to the contemplative life, so the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, which is of itself directed to the works of the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, belongs directly to the active life, provided we take <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> in its proper sense as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> speaks of it.

<p>If, however, we take it in a more general sense, as comprising any kind of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, then <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, as regards a certain part thereof, belongs to the contemplative life. On this sense Tully (De Offic. i, 5) says that "the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who is able most clearly and quickly to grasp the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and to unfold his reasons, is wont to be considered most <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> and wise."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Moral works take their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from their end, as stated above (I-II, 18, 4,6), wherefore the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> pertaining to the contemplative life is that which has its end in the very <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; whereas the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, through having its end in an act of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, belongs to the active life.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> External occupation makes a man see less in intelligible things, which are separated from sensible objects with which the works of the active life are concerned. Nevertheless the external occupation of the active life enables a man to see more clearly in judging of what is to be done, which belongs to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, both on account of experience, and on account of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind's</a> attention, since "brains avail when the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is attentive" as Sallust observes [Bell. Catilin., LI].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">Prudence</a> is said to be intermediate between the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> because it resides in the same subject as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and has absolutely the same <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> as the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. But this third kind of life is intermediate between the active and the contemplative life as regards the things about which it is occupied, because it is occupied sometimes with the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, sometimes with <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> things.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether teaching is a work of the active or of the contemplative life?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that teaching is a work not of the active but of the contemplative life. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. v in Ezech.) that "the perfect who have been able to contemplate heavenly goods, at least through a glass, proclaim them to their brethren, whose minds they inflame with love for their hidden beauty." But this pertains to teaching. Therefore teaching is a work of the contemplative life.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, act and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> would seem to be referable to the same kind of life. Now teaching is an act of wisdom: for the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. i, 1) that "to be able to teach is an indication of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>." Therefore since wisdom or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> pertain to the contemplative life, it would seem that teaching also belongs to the contemplative life.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, no less than <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, is an act of the contemplative life. Now <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, even when one <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for another, belongs to the contemplative life. Therefore it would seem that it belongs also to the contemplative life to acquaint another, by teaching him, of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> we have meditated.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xiv in Ezech.): "The active life is to give bread to the hungry, to teach the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> the words of wisdom."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The act of teaching has a twofold object. For teaching is conveyed by speech, and speech is the audible sign of the interior concept. Accordingly one object of teaching is the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> or object of the interior concept; and as to this object teaching belongs sometimes to the active, sometimes to the contemplative life. It belongs to the active life, when a man conceives a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> inwardly, so as to be directed thereby in his outward action; but it belongs to the contemplative life when a man conceives an intelligible <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, in the consideration and love whereof he delights. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Verb. Dom. Serm. civ, 1): "Let them choose for themselves the better part," namely the contemplative life, "let them be busy with the word, long for the sweetness of teaching, occupy themselves with salutary <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>," thus stating clearly that teaching belongs to the contemplative life.

<p>The other object of teaching is on the part of the speech heard, and thus the object of teaching is the hearer. As to this object all doctrine belongs to the active life to which external actions pertain.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The authority quoted speaks expressly of doctrine as to its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, in so far as it is concerned with the consideration and love of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Habit and act have a common object. Hence this argument clearly considers the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the interior concept. For it pertains to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> having wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to be able to teach, in so far as he is able to express his interior concept in words, so as to bring another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to understand the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> He who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for another does nothing towards the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for whom he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>, but only towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who is the intelligible <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; whereas he who teaches another does something in his regard by external action. Hence the comparison fails.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the active life remains after this life?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the active life remains after this life. For the acts of the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> belong to the active life, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). But the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> endure after this life according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. xiv, 9). Therefore the active life remains after this life.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, teaching others belongs to the active life, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). But in the life to come when "we shall be like the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>," teaching will be possible: even as apparently it is in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of whom one "enlightens, cleanses, and perfects" [Coel. Hier. iii, viii] another, which refers to the "receiving of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>," according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Coel. Hier. vii). Therefore it would seem that the active life remains after this life.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the more lasting a thing is in itself, the more is it able to endure after this life. But the active life is seemingly more lasting in itself: for <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. v in Ezech.) that "we can remain fixed in the active life, whereas we are nowise able to maintain an attentive mind in the contemplative life." Therefore the active life is much more able than the contemplative to endure after this life.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xiv in Ezech.): "The active life ends with this world, but the contemplative life begins here, to be perfected in our heavenly home."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), the active life has its end in external actions: and if these be referred to the quiet of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, for that very reason they belong to the contemplative life. But in the future life of the blessed the occupation of external actions will cease, and if there be any external actions at all, these will be referred to <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> as their end. For, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says at the end of De Civitate Dei xxii, 30, "there we shall rest and we shall see, we shall see and love, we shall love and praise." And he had said before (De Civ. Dei xxii, 30) that "there <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will be seen without end, loved without wearying, praised without tiring: such will be the occupation of all, the common love, the universal activity."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (136, 1, ad 1), the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> will remain not as to those actions which are about the means, but as to the actions which are about the end. Such acts are those that conduce to the quiet of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, which in the words quoted above <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> denotes by "rest," and this rest excludes not only outward disturbances but also the inward disturbance of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The contemplative life, as stated above (Question 180, Article 4), consists chiefly in the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and as to this, one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> does not teach another, since according to <a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse10">Matthew 18:10</a>, "the little ones' <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>," who belong to the lower order, "always see the face of the Father"; and so, in the life to come, no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will teach another of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but "we shall" all "see Him as He is" (<a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse2">1 John 3:2</a>). This is in keeping with the saying of <a href="../bible/jer031.htm#verse34">Jeremiah 31:34</a>: "They shall teach no more every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> his neighbor . . . saying: <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Know</a> the Lord: for all shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> me, from the least of them even to the greatest."

<p>But as regards things pertaining to the "dispensation of the mysteries of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> teaches another by cleansing, enlightening, and perfecting him: and thus they have something of the active life so long as the world lasts, from the fact that they are occupied in administering to the creatures below them. This is signified by the fact that <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> saw <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> "ascending" the ladder--which refers to <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>--and "descending" --which refers to action. Nevertheless, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> remarks (Moral. ii, 3), "they do not wander abroad from the Divine vision, so as to be deprived of the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joys</a> of inward <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>." Hence in them the active life does not differ from the contemplative life as it does in us for whom the works of the active life are a hindrance to <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>.

<p>Nor is the likeness to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> promised to us as regards the administering to lower creatures, for this is competent to us not by reason of our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order, as it is to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but by reason of our seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> That the durability of the active life in the present state surpasses the durability of the contemplative life arises not from any property of either life considered in itself, but from our own deficiency, since we are withheld from the heights of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> by the weight of the body. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> adds (Moral. ii, 3) that "the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> through its very weakness being repelled from that immense height recoils on itself."
