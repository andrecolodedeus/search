<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the perfection of the Christian life consists chiefly in charity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life does not consist chiefly in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse20">1 Corinthians 14:20</a>): "In <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> be children, but in sense be perfect." But <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> regards not the senses but the affections. Therefore it would seem that the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life does not chiefly consist in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further,'it is written (<a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse1">Ephesians 6:1</a>)3): "Take unto you the armor of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you may be able to resist in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> day, and to stand in all things perfect"; and the text continues (<a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse1">Ephesians 6:1</a>)4,16), speaking of the armor of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: "Stand therefore having your loins girt about with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and having on the breast-plate of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> . . . in all things taking the shield of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>." Therefore the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life consists not only in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, but also in other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> like other <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, are specified by their acts. Now it is written (<a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse4">James 1:4</a>) that "patience hath a perfect work." Therefore seemingly the state of perfection consists more specially in patience.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse14">Colossians 3:14</a>): "Above all things have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which is the bond of perfection," because it binds, as it were, all the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> together in perfect unity.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing is said to be perfect in so far as it attains its proper end, which is the ultimate perfection thereof. Now it is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> that unites us to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is the last end of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind, since "he that abideth in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> abideth in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in him" (<a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse16">1 John 4:16</a>). Therefore the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life consists radically in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The perfection of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> senses would seem to consist chiefly in their concurring together in the unity of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, according to (<a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse10">1 Corinthians 1:10</a>), "That you be perfect in the same mind [sensu], and in the same judgment." Now this is effected by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> which operates consent in us men. Wherefore even the perfection of the senses consists radically in the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may be said to be perfect in two ways. First, simply: and this perfection regards that which belongs to a thing's <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, for instance an animal may be said to be perfect when it lacks nothing in the disposition of its members and in such things as are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for an animal's life. Secondly, a thing is said to be perfect relatively: and this perfection regards something connected with the thing externally, such as whiteness or blackness or something of the kind. Now the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life consists chiefly in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> whereby the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse14">1 John 3:14</a>): "He that loveth not abideth in death." Hence the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life consists simply in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, but in the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> relatively. And since that which is simply, is paramount and greatest in comparison with other things, it follows that the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is paramount in relation to the perfection that regards the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Patience is stated to have a perfect work in relation to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, in so far as it is an effect of the abundance of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> that a man bears hardships patiently, according to (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse3">Romans 8:3</a>)5, "Who . . . shall separate us from the love of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>? Shall tribulation? Or distress?" etc.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether any one can be perfect in this life?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that none can be perfect in this life. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse1">1 Corinthians 13:1</a>)0): "When that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done away." Now in this life that which is in part is not done away; for in this life <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope, which are in part, remain. Therefore none can be perfect in this life.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "The perfect is that which lacks nothing" (Phys. iii, 6). Now there is no one in this life who lacks nothing; for it is written (<a href="../bible/jam003.htm#verse2">James 3:2</a>): "In many things we all offend"; and (<a href="../bible/psa138.htm#verse16">Psalm 138:16</a>): "Thy eyes did see my imperfect being." Therefore none is perfect in this life.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life, as stated (1), relates to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which comprises the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of our neighbor. Now, neither as to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can one have perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> in this life, since according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Hom. xiv in Ezech.) "the furnace of love which begins to burn here, will burn more fiercely when we see Him Whom we love"; nor as to the love of our neighbor, since in this life we cannot love all our neighbors actually, even though we love them <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a>; and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> love is imperfect. Therefore it seems that no one can be perfect in this life.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> does not prescribe the impossible. Yet it prescribes perfection according to <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse48">Matthew 5:48</a>, "Be you . . . perfect, as also your heavenly Father is perfect." Therefore seemingly one can be perfect in this life.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life consists in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Now perfection implies a certain universality because according to Phys. iii, 6, "the perfect is that which lacks nothing." Hence we may consider a threefold perfection. One is absolute, and answers to a totality not only on the part of the lover, but also on the part of the object loved, so that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be loved as much as He is lovable. Such perfection as this is not possible to any creature, but is competent to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, in Whom <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is wholly and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>.

<p>Another perfection answers to an absolute totality on the part of the lover, so that the affective faculty always actually tends to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as much as it possibly can; and such perfection as this is not possible so long as we are on the way, but we shall have it in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<p>The third perfection answers to a totality neither on the part of the object served, nor on the part of the lover as regards his always actually tending to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but on the part of the lover as regards the removal of obstacles to the movement of love towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in which sense <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. LXXXIII, qu. 36) that "carnal desire is the bane of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; to have no carnal desires is the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>." Such perfection as this can be had in this life, and in two ways. First, by the removal from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> affections of all that is contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, such as mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and there can be no <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> apart from this perfection, wherefore it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Secondly, by the removal from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> affections not only of whatever is contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, but also of whatever hinders the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind's</a> affections from tending wholly to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> is possible apart from this perfection, for instance in those who are beginners and in those who are proficient.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> is speaking there of heavenly perfection which is not possible to those who are on the way.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Those who are perfect in this life are said to "offend in many things" with regard to venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which result from the weakness of the present life: and in this respect they have an "imperfect being" in comparison with the perfection of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of the present life do not allow of a man always tending actually to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so neither does it allow of his tending actually to each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> neighbor; but it suffices for him to tend to all in common and collectively, and to each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a> and according to the preparedness of his mind. Now in the love of our neighbor, as in the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> we may observe a twofold perfection: one without which <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is impossible, and consisting in one's having in one's affections nothing that is contrary to the love of one's neighbor; and another without which it is possible to have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. The latter perfection may be considered in three ways. First, as to the extent of love, through a man <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> not only his friends and acquaintances but also strangers and even his enemies, for as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion lxxiii) this is a mark of the perfect children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Secondly, as to the intensity of love, which is shown by the things which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> despises for his neighbor's sake, through his despising not only external goods for the sake of his neighbor, but also bodily hardships and even death, according to <a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse13">John 15:13</a>, "Greater love than this no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hath, that a man lay down his life for his friends." Thirdly, as to the effect of love, so that a man will surrender not only temporal but also <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods and even himself, for his neighbor's sake, according to the words of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse15">2 Corinthians 12:15</a>), "But I most gladly will spend and be spent myself for your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether, in this life, perfection consists in the observance of the commandments or of the counsels?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that, in this life, perfection consists in the observance not of the commandments but of the counsels. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse21">Matthew 19:21</a>): "If thou wilt be perfect, go sell all [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'what'] thou hast, and give to the poor . . . and come, follow Me." Now this is a counsel. Therefore perfection regards the counsels and not the precepts.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, all are bound to the observance of the commandments, since this is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Therefore, if the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life consists in observing the commandments, it follows that perfection is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and that all are bound thereto; and this is evidently <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life is gauged according to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Now the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, seemingly, does not consist in the observance of the commandments, since the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is preceded both by its increase and by its beginning, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Super Canonic. Joan. Tract. ix). But the beginning of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> cannot precede the observance of the commandments, since according to <a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse2">John 14:2-3</a>, "If any one love Me, he will keep My word." Therefore the perfection of life regards not the commandments but the counsels.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse5">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>): "Thou shalt love the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> with thy whole heart," and (<a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse18">Leviticus 19:18</a>): "Thou shalt love thy neighbor [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'friend'] as thyself"; and these are the commandments of which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse40">Matthew 22:40</a>): "On these two commandments dependeth the whole <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>." Now the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, in respect of which the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life is said to be perfect, consists in our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with our whole heart, and our neighbor as ourselves. Therefore it would seem that perfection consists in the observance of the precepts.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Perfection is said to consist in a thing in two ways: in one way, primarily and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>; in another, secondarily and <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>. Primarily and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life consists in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, principally as to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, secondarily as to the love of our neighbor, both of which are the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the chief commandments of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, as stated above. Now the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of our neighbor is not commanded according to a measure, so that what is in excess of the measure be a matter of counsel. This is evident from the very form of the commandment, pointing, as it does, to perfection--for instance in the words, "Thou shalt love the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> with thy whole heart": since "the whole" is the same as "the perfect," according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Phys. iii, 6), and in the words, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself," since every one loves himself most. The reason of this is that "the end of the commandment is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>," according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse5">1 Timothy 1:5</a>); and the end is not subject to a measure, but only such things as are directed to the end, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> observes (Polit. i, 3); thus a physician does not measure the amount of his healing, but how much medicine or diet he shall employ for the purpose of healing. Consequently it is evident that perfection consists <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> in the observance of the commandments; wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Perf. Justit. viii): "Why then should not this perfection be prescribed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, although no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has it in this life?"

<p>Secondarily and instrumentally, however, perfection consists in the observance of the counsels, all of which, like the commandments, are directed to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; yet not in the same way. For the commandments, other than the precepts of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, are directed to the removal of things contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, with which, namely, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is incompatible, whereas the counsels are directed to the removal of things that hinder the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and yet are not contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, such as marriage, the occupation of worldly business, and so forth. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion cxxi): "Whatever things <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> commands, for instance, 'Thou shalt not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>,' and whatever are not commanded, yet suggested by a special counsel, for instance, 'It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for a man not to touch a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>,' are then done aright when they are referred to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and of our neighbor for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake, both in this world and in the world to come." Hence it is that in the Conferences of the Fathers (Coll. i, cap. vii) the abbot <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> says: "Fastings, watchings, meditating on the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, penury and loss of all one's <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, these are not perfection but means to perfection, since not in them does the school of perfection find its end, but through them it achieves its end," and he had already said that "we endeavor to ascend by these steps to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In this saying of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> something is indicated as being the way to perfection by the words, "Go, sell all thou hast, and give to the poor"; and something else is added wherein perfection consists, when He said, "And follow Me." Hence <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> in his commentary on <a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse27">Matthew 19:27</a>, says that "since it is not enough merely to leave, Peter added that which is perfect: 'And have followed Thee'"; and <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a>, <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/luk005.htm#verse27">Luke 5:27</a>, "Follow Me," says: "He commands him to follow, not with steps of the body, but with devotion of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is the effect of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>." Wherefore it is evident from the very way of speaking that the counsels are means of attaining to perfection, since it is thus expressed: "If thou wilt be perfect, go, sell," etc., as though He said: "By so doing thou shalt accomplish this end."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Perf. Justit. viii) "the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is prescribed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in this life, because one runs not right unless one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> whither to run. And how shall we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this if no commandment declares it to us?" And since that which is a matter of precept can be fulfilled variously, one does not break a commandment through not fulfilling it in the best way, but it is enough to fulfil it in any way whatever. Now the perfection of Divine love is a matter of precept for all without exception, so that even the perfection of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is not excepted from this precept, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Perf. Justit. viii [Cf. De Spir. et Lit. XXXVI]), and one escapes transgressing the precept, in whatever measure one attains to the perfection of Divine love. The lowest degree of Divine love is to love nothing more than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or contrary to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or equally with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and whoever fails from this degree of perfection nowise fulfils the precept. There is another degree of the Divine love, which cannot be fulfilled so long as we are on the way, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), and it is evident that to fail from this is not to be a transgressor of the precept; and in like manner one does not transgress the precept, if one does not attain to the intermediate degrees of perfection, provided one attain to the lowest.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Just as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has a certain perfection of his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as soon as he is born, which perfection belongs to the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of his <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, while there is another perfection which he acquires by growth, so again there is a perfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> which belongs to the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, namely that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> above all things, and love nothing contrary to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while there is another perfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> even in this life, whereto a man attains by a kind of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> growth, for instance when a man refrains even from lawful things, in order more freely to give himself to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether whoever is perfect is in the state of perfection?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that whoever is perfect is in the state of perfection. For, as stated above (3, ad 3), just as bodily perfection is reached by bodily growth, so <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> perfection is acquired by <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> growth. Now after bodily growth one is said to have reached the state of perfect age. Therefore seemingly also after <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> growth, when one has already reached <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> perfection, one is in the state of perfection.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to Phys. v, 2, movement "from one contrary to another" has the same aspect as "movement from less to more." Now when a man is changed from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, he is said to change his state, in so far as the state of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> differs from the state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore it would seem that in the same manner, when one progresses from a lesser to a greater <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, so as to reach the perfect degree, one is in the state of perfection.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a man acquires a state by being freed from servitude. But one is freed from the servitude of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, because "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> covereth all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>" (<a href="../bible/pro010.htm#verse12">Proverbs 10:12</a>). Now one is said to be perfect on account of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore, seemingly, whoever has perfection, for this very reason has the state of perfection.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Some are in the state of perfection, who are wholly lacking in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, for instance <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or religious. Therefore it would seem that on the other hand some have the perfection of life, who nevertheless have not the state of perfection.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 183, Article 1), state properly regards a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of freedom or servitude. Now <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> freedom or servitude may be considered in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in two ways: first, with respect to his internal actions; secondly, with respect to his external actions. And since according to (<a href="../bible/1sa016.htm#verse7">1 Samuel 16:7</a>), "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> seeth those things that appear, but the Lord beholdeth the heart," it follows that with regard to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> internal disposition we consider his <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> state in relation to the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">Divine judgment</a>, while with regard to his external actions we consider <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> state in relation to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It is in this latter sense that we are now speaking of states, namely in so far as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> derives a certain beauty from the variety of states [Cf. 183, 2].

<p>Now it must be observed, that so far as men are concerned, in order that any one attain to a state of freedom or servitude there is required first of all an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> or a release. For the mere fact of serving someone does not make a man a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a>, since even the free serve, according to (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse13">Galatians 5:13</a>), "By <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of the spirit serve one another": nor again does the mere fact of ceasing to serve make a man free, as in the case of a runaway <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a>; but properly speaking a man is a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> if he be bound to serve, and a man is free if he be released from service. Secondly, it is required that the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> be imposed with a certain <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a>; even as a certain <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> is observed in other matters which among men obtain a settlement in perpetuity.

<p>Accordingly, properly speaking, one is said to be in the state of perfection, not through having the act of perfect love, but through binding himself in perpetuity and with a certain <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> to those things that pertain to perfection. Moreover it happens that some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> bind themselves to that which they do not keep, and some fulfil that to which they have not bound themselves, as in the case of the two sons (<a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse28">Matthew 21:28-30</a>), one of whom when his father said: "Work in my vineyard," answered: "I will not," and "afterwards . . . he went," while the other "answering said: I go . . . and he went not." Wherefore nothing hinders some from being perfect without being in the state of perfection, and some in the state of perfection without being perfect.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> By bodily growth a man progresses in things pertaining to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, wherefore he attains to the state of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; especially since "what is according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is," in a way, "unchangeable" [Ethic. v, 7, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is determinate to one thing. On like manner by inward <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> growth a man reaches the state of perfection in relation to the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">Divine judgment</a>. But as regards the distinctions of ecclesiastical states, a man does not reach the state of perfection except by growth in respect of external actions.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument also regards the interior state. Yet when a man passes from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, he passes from servitude to freedom; and this does not result from a mere progress in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, except when a man binds himself to things pertaining to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Again this argument considers the interior state. Nevertheless, although <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the change of <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> from <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> servitude to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> freedom, an increase of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> has not the same effect.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether religious and prelates are in the state of perfection?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and religious are not in the state of perfection. For the state of perfection differs from the state of the beginners and the proficient. Now no class of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> is specially assigned to the state of the proficient or of the beginners. Therefore it would seem that neither should any class of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> be assigned to the state of perfection.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the outward state should answer to the inward, else one is guilty of lying, "which consists not only in <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> words, but also in deceitful <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>," according to <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> in one of his sermons (xxx de Tempore). Now there are many <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and religious who have not the inward perfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore, if all religious and <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> are in the state of perfection, it would follow that all of them that are not perfect are in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as deceivers and <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">liars</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), perfection is measured according to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Now the most perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> would seem to be in the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse13">John 15:13</a>, "Greater love than this no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hath, that a man lay down his life for his friends": and a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse4">Hebrews 12:4</a>, "For you have not yet resisted unto blood," says: "In this life no love is more perfect than that to which the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> attained, who strove against <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> even unto blood." Therefore it would seem that the state of perfection should be ascribed to the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> rather than to religious and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Eccl. Hier. v) ascribes perfection to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> as being perfecters, and (Eccl. Hier. vi) to religious (whom he calls <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> or <em>therapeutai</em>, i.e. servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>) as being perfected.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>), there is required for the state of perfection a perpetual <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to things pertaining to perfection, together with a certain <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a>. Now both these <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> are competent to religious and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. For religious bind themselves by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to refrain from worldly affairs, which they might lawfully use, in order more freely to give themselves to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, wherein consists the perfection of the present life. Hence <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. vi), speaking of religious: "Some call them <em>therapeutai</em>," i.e. servants, "on account of their rendering pure service and homage to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; others call them <em>monachoi</em>" [i.e. solitaries; whence the English word '<a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>'], "on account of the indivisible and single-minded life which by their being wrapped in," i.e. contemplating, "indivisible things, unites them in a Godlike union and a perfection beloved of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" [Cf. 180, 6]. Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> in both cases is undertaken with a certain <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> of profession and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>; wherefore <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> adds (Eccl. Hier. vi): "Hence the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> legislation in bestowing perfect <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> on them accords them a hallowing invocation."

<p>In like manner <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> bind themselves to things pertaining to perfection when they take up the pastoral <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, to which it belongs that a shepherd "lay down his life for his sheep," according to <a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse15">John 10:15</a>. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse1">1 Timothy 6:1</a>)2): "Thou . . . hast confessed a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> confession before many <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>," that is to say, "when he was ordained," as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says on this passage. Again, a certain <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> is employed together with the aforesaid profession, according to (<a href="../bible/2ti001.htm#verse6">2 Timothy 1:6</a>): "Stir up the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> which is in thee by the imposition of my hands," which the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> ascribes to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the episcopate. And <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. v) that "when the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>," i.e. the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, "is ordained, he receives on his head the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> imposition of the sacred oracles, whereby it is signified that he is a participator in the whole and entire <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchical</a> power, and that not only is he the enlightener in all things pertaining to his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> discourses and actions, but that he also confers this on others."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Beginning and increase are sought not for their own sake, but for the sake of perfection; hence it is only to the state of perfection that some are admitted under certain <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> and with <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Those who enter the state of perfection do not profess to be perfect, but to tend to perfection. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse12">Philippians 3:12</a>): "Not as though I had already attained, or were already perfect; but I follow after, if I may by any means apprehend": and afterwards (<a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse15">Philippians 3:15</a>): "Let us therefore as many as are perfect, be thus minded." Hence a man who takes up the state of perfection is not guilty of lying or deceit through not being perfect, but through withdrawing his mind from the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of reaching perfection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Martyrdom is the most perfect <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. But an act of perfection does not suffice to make the state of perfection, as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>).

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether all ecclesiastical prelates are in the state of perfection?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that all ecclesiastical <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> are in a state of perfection. For <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> commenting on <a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse5">Titus 1:5</a>, "Ordain . . . in every city," etc. says: "Formerly <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> was the same as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>," and afterwards he adds: "Just as <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that by the custom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> they are subject to the one who is placed over them, so too, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should recognize that, by custom rather than by the very ordinance of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>, they are above the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and are together the rightful governors of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are in the state of perfection. Therefore those <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> also are who have the cure of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> together with their <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> receive the cure of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, so also do <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacons</a>, of whom a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/act006.htm#verse3">Acts 6:3</a>, "Brethren, look ye out . . . seven men of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> reputation," says: "The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> decided here to appoint throughout the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> seven <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, who were to be of a higher degree, and as it were the supports of that which is nearest to the altar." Therefore it would seem that these also are in the state of perfection.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are bound to "lay down their life for their sheep," so too are <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacons</a>. But this belongs to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as stated above (2, ad 3). Therefore it would seem that <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacons</a> also are in the state of perfection.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. v): "The order of pontiffs is consummative and perfecting, that of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> is illuminative and light-giving, that of the ministers is cleansing and discretive." Hence it is evident that perfection is ascribed to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> only.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> having cure of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> two things may be considered, namely their order and their cure. Their order is directed to some act in the Divine offices. Wherefore it has been stated above (183, 3, ad 3) that the distinction of orders is comprised under the distinction of offices. Hence by receiving a certain order a man receives the power of exercising certain sacred acts, but he is not bound on this account to things pertaining to perfection, except in so far as in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a> the receiving of a sacred order includes the taking of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, which is one of the things pertaining to perfection, as we shall state further on (186, 4). Therefore it is clear that from the fact that a man receives a sacred order a man is not placed simply in the state of perfection, although inward perfection is required in order that one exercise such acts worthily.

<p>In like manner, neither are they placed in the state of perfection on the part of the cure which they take upon themselves. For they are not bound by this very fact under the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of a perpetual <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to retain the cure of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; but they can surrender it--either by entering religion, even without their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> permission (cf. Decret. xix, qu. 2, can. Duae sunt)--or again an <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> may with his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> permission resign his arch-deaconry or <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, and accept a simple prebend without cure, which would be nowise lawful, if he were in the state of perfection; for "no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> putting his hand to the plough and looking back is fit for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>" (<a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse62">Luke 9:62</a>). On the other hand <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, since they are in the state of perfection, cannot abandon the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> cure, save by the authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Sovereign Pontiff</a> (to whom alone it belongs also to dispense from perpetual <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>), and this for certain <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, as we shall state further on (185, 4). Wherefore it is manifest that not all <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> are in the state of perfection, but only <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> We may speak of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in two ways. First, with regard to the name: and thus formerly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were not distinct. For <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are so called "because they watch over others," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> observes (De Civ. Dei xix, 19); while the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> according to the Greek are "elders." [Referring to the Greek <em>episkopos</em> and <em>presbyteros</em> from which the English '<a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>' and '<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>' are derived.] Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> employs the term "<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>" in reference to both, when he says (<a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse1">1 Timothy 5:1</a>)7): "Let the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> that rule well be esteemed worthy of double <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>"; and again he uses the term "<a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>" in the same way, wherefore addressing the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Ephesus he says (<a href="../bible/act020.htm#verse28">Acts 20:28</a>): "Take heed to yourselves" and "to the whole flock, wherein the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> hath placed you <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, to rule the church of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p>But as regards the thing signified by these terms, there was always a difference between them, even at the time of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. This is clear on the authority of <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Eccl. Hier. v), and of a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on (<a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse1">Luke 10:1</a>), "After these things the Lord appointed," etc. which says: "Just as the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, so the seventy-two <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were made <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the second order." Subsequently, however, in order to avoid <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, it became <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to distinguish even the terms, by calling the higher ones <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the lower ones <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. But to assert that <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> nowise differ from <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> is reckoned by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> doctrines (De Heres. liii), where he says that the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> maintained that "no distinction <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> between a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Bishops have the chief cure of the sheep of their diocese, while <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacons</a> exercise an inferior ministry under the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Hence a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on (<a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse2">1 Corinthians 12:2</a>)8, "to one, helps, to another, governments [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: '<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath set some in the church . . . helps, governments,' etc.]," says: "Helps, namely assistants to those who are in authority," as <a href="../cathen/14727b.htm">Titus</a> was to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>, or as <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacons</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; "governments, namely <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of lesser authority, such as <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who have to instruct the people": and <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. v) that "just as we see the whole <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> culminating in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, so each office culminates in its respective godlike hierarch or <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>." Also it is said (XVI, qu. i, can. Cunctis): "Priests and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> must all take care not to do anything without their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> permission." Wherefore it is evident that they stand in relation to their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> as wardens or mayors to the king; and for this reason, just as in earthly governments the king alone receives a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>, while others are appointed by simple commission, so too in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> cure is conferred with the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> or <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> receives his cure by simple appointment; although they are <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by receiving orders before having a cure.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacons</a> have not the chief cure, but a certain ministry as committed to them by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, so the pastoral office does not belong to them in chief, nor are they bound to lay down their life for the sheep, except in so far as they have a share in their cure. Hence we should say that they have an office pertaining to perfection rather than that they attain the state of perfection.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the religious state is more perfect than that of prelates?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the religious state is more perfect than that of <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse21">Matthew 19:21</a>): "If thou wilt be perfect, go" and "sell" all [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'what'] "thou hast, and give to the poor"; and religious do this. But <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are not bound to do so; for it is said (XII, qu. i, can. Episcopi de rebus): "Bishops, if they wish, may bequeath to their heirs their personal or acquired property, and whatever belongs to them personally." Therefore religious are in a more perfect state than <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, perfection consists more especially in the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than in the love of our neighbor. Now the religious state is directly ordered to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, wherefore it takes its name from "service and homage to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. vi); [Quoted above 5 whereas the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> state would seem to be ordered to the love of our neighbor, of whose cure he is the "warden," and from this he takes his name, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> observes (De Civ. Dei. xix, 19). Therefore it would seem that the religious state is more perfect than that of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the religious state is directed to the contemplative life, which is more excellent than the active life to which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> state is directed. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Pastor. i, 7) that "Isaias wishing to be of profit to his neighbor by means of the active life desired the office of preaching, whereas <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremias</a>, who was fain to hold fast to the love of his Creator, exclaimed against being sent to preach." Therefore it would seem that the religious state is more perfect than the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> state.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is not lawful for anyone to pass from a more excellent to a less excellent state; for this would be to look back [Cf. (<a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse62">Luke 9:62</a>). Yet a man may pass from the religious to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> state, for it is said (XVIII, qu. i, can. Statutum) that "the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> ordination makes a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> to be a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> state is more perfect than the religious.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 16), "the agent is ever more excellent than the patient." Now in the genus of perfection according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Eccl. Hier. v, vi), <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are in the position of "perfecters," whereas religious are in the position of being "perfected"; the former of which pertains to action, and the latter to passion. Whence it is evident that the state of perfection is more excellent in <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> than in religious.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Renunciation of one's possessions may be considered in two ways. First, as being actual: and thus it is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a>, but a means, to perfection, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). Hence nothing hinders the state of perfection from being without renunciation of one's possessions, and the same applies to other outward practices. Secondly, it may be considered in relation to one's preparedness, in the sense of being prepared to renounce or give away all: and this belongs directly to perfection. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De QQ. Evang. ii, qu. 11): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> shows that the children of wisdom understand righteousness to consist neither in eating nor in abstaining, but in bearing want patiently." Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse12">Philippians 4:12</a>): "I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> . . . both to abound and to suffer need." Now <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> especially are bound to despise all things for the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> welfare of their flock, when it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for them to do so, either by giving to the poor of their flock, or by suffering "with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> the being stripped of" their "own goods" [<a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse34">Hebrews 10:34</a>].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> That <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are busy about things pertaining to the love of their neighbor, arises out of the abundance of their love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> asked Peter first of all whether he loved Him, and afterwards committed the care of His flock to him. And <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Pastor. i, 5): "If the pastoral care is a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of love, he who refuses to feed <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> flock, though having the means to do so, is convicted of not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> the supreme Pastor." And it is a sign of greater love if a man devotes himself to others for his friend's sake, than if he be willing only to serve his friend.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Pastor. ii, 1), "a prelate should be foremost in action, and more uplifted than others in <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>," because it is incumbent on him to contemplate, not only for his own sake, but also for the purpose of instructing others. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> applies (Hom. v in Ezech.) the words of <a href="../bible/psa144.htm#verse7">Psalm 144:7</a>, "They shall publish the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> . . . of Thy sweetness," to perfect men returning after their <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether parish priests and archdeacons are more perfect than religious?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that also <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacons</a> are more perfect than religious. For <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says in his Dialogue (De Sacerdot. vi): "Take for example a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, such as Elias, if I may exaggerate somewhat, he is not to be compared with one who, cast among the people and compelled to carry the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of many, remains firm and strong." A little further on he says: "If I were given the choice, where would I prefer to please, in the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> office, or in the monastic solitude, without hesitation I should choose the former." Again in the same book (ch. 5) he says: "If you compare the toils of this project, namely of the monastic life, with a well-employed <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, you will find them as far distant from one another as a common citizen is from a king." Therefore it would seem that <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who have the cure of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are more perfect than religious.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (ad Valerium, Ep. xxi): "Let thy religious <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> observe that in this life, and especially at these times, there is nothing so difficult, so onerous, so perilous as the office of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>; while in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sight there is no greater <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>, if one engage in the fight as ordered by our Commander-in-chief." Therefore religious are not more perfect than <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. lx, ad Aurel.): "It would be most regrettable, were we to exalt <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to such a disastrous degree of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and deem the clergy deserving of such a grievous insult," as to assert that 'a bad <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> clerk,' "since sometimes even a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> makes a bad clerk." And a little before this he says that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> servants," i.e. monks, "must not be allowed to think that they may easily be chosen for something better," namely the clerical state, "if they should become worse thereby," namely by leaving the monastic state. Therefore it would seem that those who are in the clerical state are more perfect than religious.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it is not lawful to pass from a more perfect to a less perfect state. Yet it is lawful to pass from the monastic state to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> office with a cure attached, as appears (XVI, qu. i, can. Si quis monachus) from a decree of <a href="../cathen/06406a.htm">Pope Gelasius</a>, who says: "If there be a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, who by the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of his exemplary life is worthy of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and the abbot under whose authority he fights for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> his King, ask that he be made a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> shall take him and ordain him in such place as he shall choose fitting." And <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (Ad Rustic. Monach., Ep. cxxv): "In the monastery so live as to deserve to be a clerk." Therefore <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacons</a> are more perfect than religious.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are in a more perfect state than religious, as shown above (<a href="#7">Article 7</a>). But <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacons</a>. through having cure of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, are more like <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> than religious are. Therefore they are more perfect.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> "is concerned with the difficult and the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" (Ethic. ii, 3). Now it is more difficult to lead a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> life in the office of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> than in the religious state. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacons</a> have more perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than religious.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is stated (XIX, qu. ii, cap. Duce): "If a man while governing the people in his church under the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and leading a secular life is inspired by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> to desire to work out his <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in a monastery or under some canonical rule, since he is led by a private <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, there is no reason why he should be constrained by a public <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>." Now a man is not led by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, which is here called a "private <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>," except to something more perfect. Therefore it would seem that religious are more perfect than <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacons</a> or <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> When we compare things in the point of super-eminence, we look not at that in which they agree, but at that wherein they differ. Now in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacons</a> three things may be considered, their state, their order, and their office. It belongs to their state that they are seculars, to their order that they are <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, to their office that they have the cure of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> committed to them.

<p>Accordingly, if we compare these with one who is a religious by state, a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by order, having the cure of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> by office, as many <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and canons regular have, this one will excel in the first point, and in the other points he will be equal. But if the latter differ from the former in state and office, but agree in order, such as religious <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> not having the cure of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, it is evident that the latter will be more excellent than the former in state, less excellent in office, and equal in order.

<p>We must therefore consider which is the greater, preeminence of state or of office; and here, seemingly, we should take note of two things, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and difficulty. Accordingly, if we make the comparison with a view to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, the religious state surpasses the office of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>, because a religious pledges his whole life to the quest of perfection, whereas the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> does not pledge his whole life to the cure of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, as a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> does, nor is it competent to him, as it is to a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, to exercise the cure of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in chief, but only in certain particulars regarding the cure of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> committed to his charge, as stated above (6, ad 2). Wherefore the comparison of their religious state with their office is like the comparisons of the universal with the particular, and of a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a> with a sacrifice which is less than a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a> according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Hom. xx in Ezech.). Hence it is said (XIX, qu. i, can. Clerici qui monachorum.): "Clerics who wish to take the monastic <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> through being desirous of a better life must be allowed by their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> the free entrance into the monastery."

<p>This comparison, however, must be considered as regarding the genus of the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>; for as regards the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of the doer it happens sometimes that a <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> which is of less account in its genus is of greater <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> if it be done out of greater <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p>On the other hand, if we consider the difficulty of leading a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> life in religion, and in the office of one having the cure of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, in this way it is more difficult to lead a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> life together with the exercise of the cure of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, on account of outward dangers: although the religious life is more difficult as regards the genus of the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, by reason of the strictness of religious observance. If, however, the religious is also without orders, as in the case of religious lay brethren, then it is evident that the pre-eminence of order excels in the point of dignity, since by <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> orders a man is appointed to the most august ministry of serving <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself in the sacrament of the altar. For this requires a greater inward <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> than that which is requisite for the religious state, since as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. vi) the monastic order must follow the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> orders, and ascend to Divine things in imitation of them. Hence, other things being equal, a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> who is in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> orders, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> more grievously if he do something contrary to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> than a religious who is not in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> orders: although a religious who is not in orders is bound to regular observance to which <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> orders are not bound.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> We might answer briefly these quotations from <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> by saying that he speaks not of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of lesser order who has the cure of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, but of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who is called a <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a>; and this agrees with the purpose of that book wherein he consoles himself and <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a> in that they were chosen to be <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. We may, however, pass this over and reply that he speaks in view of the difficulty. For he had already said: "When the pilot is surrounded by the stormy sea and is able to bring the ship safely out of the tempest, then he deserves to be acknowledged by all as a perfect pilot"; and afterwards he concludes, as quoted, with regard to the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, "who is not to be compared with one who, cast among the people . . . remains firm"; and he gives the reason why, because "both in the calm end in the storm he piloted himself to safety." This proves nothing more than that the state of one who has the cure of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> is fraught with more danger than the monastic state; and to keep oneself innocent in face of a greater peril is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. on the other hand, it also indicates greatness of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> if a man avoid dangers by entering religion; hence he does not say that "he would prefer the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> office to the monastic solitude," but that "he would rather please" in the former than in the latter, since this is a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This passage quoted from <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> also clearly refers to the question of difficulty which proves the greatness of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in those who lead a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> life, as stated above (ad 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> there compares <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> with <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> as regards the pre-eminence of order, not as regards the distinction between religious and secular life.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Those who are taken from the religious state to receive the cure of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, being already in sacred orders, attain to something they had not hitherto, namely the office of the cure, yet they do not put aside what they had already. For it is said in the Decretals (XVI, qu. i, can. De Monachis): "With regard to those <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who after long residence in a monastery attain to the order of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, we bid them not to lay aside their former purpose."

<p>On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacons</a>, when they enter religion, resign their cure, in order to enter the state of perfection. This very fact shows the excellence of the religious life. When religious who are not in orders are admitted to the clerical state and to the sacred orders, they are clearly promoted to something better, as stated: this is indicated by the very way in which <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> expresses himself: "So live in the monastery as to deserve to be a clerk."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Parish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacons</a> are more like <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> than religious are, in a certain respect, namely as regards the cure of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> which they have subordinately; but as regards the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> in perpetuity, religious are more like a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, as appears from what we have said above (A5,6).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> The difficulty that arises from the arduousness of the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> adds to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; but the difficulty that results from outward obstacles sometimes lessens the perfection of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>--for instance, when a man loves not <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> so much as to wish to avoid the obstacles to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, according to the saying of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse25">1 Corinthians 9:25</a>), "Everyone that striveth for the mastery refraineth himself from all things": and sometimes it is a sign of perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>--for instance, when a man forsakes not <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, although he is hindered in the practice of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> unawares or by some unavoidable <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. On the religious state there is greater difficulty arising from the arduousness of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>; whereas for those who in any way at all live in the world, there is greater difficulty resulting from obstacles to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which obstacles the religious has had the foresight to avoid.
