<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether it is lawful to desire the office of a bishop?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is lawful to desire the office of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse1">1 Timothy 3:1</a>): "He that desires [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'If a man desire'] the office of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, he desireth a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work." Now it is lawful and praiseworthy to desire a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work. Therefore it is even praiseworthy to desire the office of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> state is more perfect than the religious, as we have said above (Question 184, Article 07). But it is praiseworthy to desire to enter the religious state. Therefore it is also praiseworthy to desire promotion to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> state.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/pro011.htm#verse2">Proverbs 11:2</a>)6): "He that hideth up corn shall be <a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">cursed</a> among the people; but a <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> upon the head of them that sell." Now a man who is apt, both in manner of life and by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> office, would seem to hide up the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> corn, if he shun the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> state, whereas by accepting the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> office he enters the state of a dispenser of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> corn. Therefore it would seem praiseworthy to desire the office of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and blameworthy to refuse it.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> related in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> are set before us as an example, according to (<a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse4">Romans 15:4</a>), "What things soever were written, were written for our learning." Now we read (<a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse8">Isaiah 6:8</a>) that Isaias offered himself for the office of preacher, which belongs chiefly to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Therefore it would seem praiseworthy to desire the office of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xix, 19): "The higher place, without which the people cannot be ruled, though it be filled becomingly, is unbecomingly desired."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Three things may be considered in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> office. One is principal and final, namely the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> work, whereby the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of our neighbor is intended, according to <a href="../bible/joh021.htm#verse17">John 21:17</a>, "Feed My sheep." Another thing is the height of degree, for a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is placed above others, according to <a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse45">Matthew 24:45</a>, "A faithful and a wise servant, whom his lord hath appointed over his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>." The third is something resulting from these, namely reverence, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, and a sufficiency of temporalities, according to (<a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse1">1 Timothy 5:1</a>)7, "Let the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> that rule well be esteemed worthy of double <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>." Accordingly, to desire the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> office on account of these incidental goods is manifestly unlawful, and pertains to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> or ambition. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said against the Pharisees (<a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse6">Matthew 23:6-7</a>): "They love the first places at feasts, and the first chairs in the synagogues, and salutations in the market-place, and to be called by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, Rabbi." As regards the second, namely the height of degree, it is presumptuous to desire the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> office. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> reproved His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> for seeking precedence, by saying to them (<a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse25">Matthew 20:25</a>): "You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the princes of the gentiles lord it over them." Here <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. lxv in Matth.) that in these words "He points out that it is heathenish to seek precedence; and thus by comparing them to the gentiles He converted their impetuous <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>."

<p>On the other hand, to desire to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to one's neighbor is in itself praiseworthy, and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>. Nevertheless, since considered as an <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> act it has the height of degree attached to it, it would seem that, unless there be manifest and urgent reason for it, it would be presumptuous for any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to desire to be set over others in order to do them <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Thus <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Pastor. i, 8) that "it was praiseworthy to seek the office of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> when it was certain to bring one into graver dangers." Wherefore it was not easy to find a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to accept this burden, especially seeing that it is through the zeal of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> that one divinely instigated to do so, according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, who says (Pastor. i, 7) that "<a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaias</a> being desirous of profiting his neighbor, commendably desired the office of preacher."

<p>Nevertheless, anyone may, without presumption, desire to do such like works if he should happen to be in that office, or to be worthy of doing them; so that the object of his desire is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work and not the precedence in dignity. Hence <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>* says: "It is indeed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to desire a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work, but to desire the primacy of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is vanity. For primacy seeks one that shuns it, and abhors one that desires it." [The quotation is from the Opus Imperfectum in Matth. (Hom. xxxv), <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>.]

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Pastor. i, 8), "when the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> said this he who was set over the people was the first to be dragged to the torments of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>," so that there was nothing to be desired in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> office, save the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xix, 19) that when the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> said, "'Whoever desireth the office of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, desireth a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work,' he wished to explain what the episcopacy is: for it denotes work and not <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>: since <em>skopos</em> signifies 'watching.' Wherefore if we like we may render <em>episkopein</em> by the <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> 'superintendere' [to watch over]: thus a man may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> himself to be no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> if he loves to precede rather than to profit others." For, as he observed shortly before, "in our actions we should seek, not <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> nor power in this life, since all things beneath the sun are vanity, but the work itself which that <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> or power enables us to do." Nevertheless, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Pastor. i, 8), "while praising the desire" (namely of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work) "he forthwith turns this object of praise into one of fear, when he adds: It behooveth . . . a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to be blameless," as though to say: "I praise what you seek, but learn first what it is you seek."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> There is no parity between the religious and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> state, for two reasons. First, because perfection of life is a prerequisite of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> state, as appears from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> asking Peter if he loved Him more than the others, before committing the pastoral office to him, whereas perfection is not a prerequisite of the religious state, since the latter is the way to perfection. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> did not say (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse21">Matthew 19:21</a>): "If thou art perfect, go, sell all [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'what'] thou hast," but "If thou wilt be perfect." The reason for this difference is because, according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Eccl. Hier. vi), perfection pertains actively to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, as the "perfecter," but to the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> passively as one who is "perfected": and one needs to be perfect in order to bring others to perfection, but not in order to be brought to perfection. Now it is presumptuous to think oneself perfect, but it is not presumptuous to tend to perfection. Secondly, because he who enters the religious state subjects himself to others for the sake of a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> profit, and anyone may lawfully do this. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xix, 19): "No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is debarred from striving for the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, since this pertains to a praiseworthy ease." On the other hand, he who enters the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> state is raised up in order to watch over others, and no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should seek to be raised thus, according to <a href="../bible/heb005.htm#verse4">Hebrews 5:4</a>, "Neither doth any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> take the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to himself, but he that is called by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>": and <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says: "To desire supremacy in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is neither just nor useful. For what wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> seeks of his own accord to submit to such servitude and peril, as to have to render an account of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? None save him who <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> judgment, and makes a secular abuse of his ecclesiastical authority, by turning it to secular uses."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The dispensing of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> corn is not to be carried on in an arbitrary fashion, but chiefly according to the appointment and disposition of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in the second place according to the appointment of the higher <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, in whose <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> it is said (<a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse1">1 Corinthians 4:1</a>): "Let a man so account of us as of the ministers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the dispensers of the mysteries of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Wherefore a man is not deemed to hide <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> corn if he avoids governing or correcting others, and is not competent to do so, neither in virtue of his office nor of his superior's command; thus alone is he deemed to hide it, when he neglects to dispense it while under <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to do so in virtue of his office, or obstinately refuses to accept the office when it is imposed on him. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xix, 19): "The love of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> seeks a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> leisure, the demands of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> undertake an honest labor. If no one imposes this burden upon us, we must devote ourselves to the research and <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but if it be imposed on us, we must bear it because <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> demands it of us."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Pastor. i, 7), "Isaias, who wishing to be sent, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> himself to be already cleansed by the live coal taken from the altar, shows us that no one should dare uncleansed to approach the sacred ministry. Since, then, it is very difficult for anyone to be able to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he is cleansed, it is safer to decline the office of preacher."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether it is lawful for a man to refuse absolutely an appointment to the episcopate?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is lawful to refuse absolutely an appointment to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopate</a>. For as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Pastor. i, 7), "Isaias wishing to be of profit to his neighbor by means of the active life, desired the office of preaching, whereas <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremias</a> who was fain to hold fast to the love of his Creator by <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> exclaimed against being sent to preach." Now no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by being unwilling to forgo better things in order to adhere to things that are not so <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Since then the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> surpasses the love of our neighbor, and the contemplative life is preferable to the active, as shown above (25, 1; 26, 2;182, 1) it would seem that a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not if he refuse absolutely the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> office.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Pastor. i, 7), "it is very difficult for anyone to be able to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he is cleansed: nor should anyone uncleansed approach the sacred ministry." Therefore if a man perceives that he is not cleansed, however urgently the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> office be enjoined him, he ought not to accept it.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> (Prologue, super Marc.) says that "it is related of the Blessed Mark* that after receiving the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> he cut off his thumb that he might be excluded from the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>." [This prologue was <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, and the passage quoted refers, not to St. Mark the Evangelist, but to a hermit of that name. (Cf. Baronius, Anno Christi, 45, num. XLIV)] Likewise some take a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> never to accept a bishopric. Now to place an obstacle to a thing amounts to the same as refusing it altogether. Therefore it would seem that one may, without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, refuse the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> office absolutely.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. xlviii ad Eudox.): "If Mother Church requires your service, neither accept with greedy conceit, nor refuse with fawning indolence"; and afterwards he adds: "Nor prefer your ease to the needs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: for if no <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> men were willing to assist her in her labor, you would seek in vain how we could be born of her."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Two things have to be considered in the acceptance of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> office: first, what a man may fittingly desire according to his own will; secondly, what it behooves a man to do according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of another. As regards his own will it becomes a man to look chiefly to his own <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> welfare, whereas that he look to the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> welfare of others becomes a man according to the appointment of another having authority, as stated above (1, ad 3). Hence just as it is a mark of an inordinate will that a man of his own choice incline to be appointed to the government of others, so too it indicates an inordinate will if a man definitively refuse the aforesaid office of government in direct opposition to the appointment of his superior: and this for two reasons.

<p>First, because this is contrary to the love of our neighbor, for whose <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> a man should offer himself according as place and time demand: hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xix, 19) that "the demands of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> undertake an honest labor." Secondly, because this is contrary to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, whereby a man submits to his superior's commands: hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Pastor. i, 6): "In <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sight <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is genuine when it does not obstinately refuse to submit to what is usefully prescribed."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although simply and absolutely speaking the contemplative life is more excellent than the active, and the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> better than the love of our neighbor, yet, on the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the many should be preferred to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in the passage quoted above: "Nor prefer your own ease to the needs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>," and all the more since it belongs to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that a man undertake the pastoral care of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sheep. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, commenting on <a href="../bible/joh021.htm#verse17">John 21:17</a>, "Feed My sheep," says (Tract. cxxiii in Joan.): "Be it the task of love to feed the Lord's flock, even as it was the mark of fear to deny the Shepherd."

<p>Moreover <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> are not transferred to the active life, so as to forsake the contemplative; wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xix, 19) that "if the burden of the pastoral office be imposed, we must not abandon the delights of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>," which are derived from <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> No one is bound to obey his superior by doing what is unlawful, as appears from what was said above concerning obedience (104, 5). Accordingly it may happen that he who is appointed to the office of prelate perceive something in himself on account of which it is unlawful for him to accept a prelacy. But this obstacle may sometimes be removed by the very <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who is appointed to the pastoral cure--for instance, if he have a purpose to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he may abandon it--and for this reason he is not excused from being bound to obey definitely the superior who has appointed him. Sometimes, however, he is unable himself to remove the impediment that makes the pastoral office unlawful to him, yet the prelate who appoints him can do so--for instance, if he be <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregular</a> or <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a>. On such a case he ought to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> his defect to the prelate who has appointed him; and if the latter be willing to remove the impediment, he is bound humbly to obey. Hence when <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> had said (<a href="../bible/exo004.htm#verse10">Exodus 4:10</a>): "I beseech thee, Lord, I am not eloquent from yesterday, and the day before," the Lord answered (<a href="../bible/exo004.htm#verse12">Exodus 4:12</a>): "I will be in thy mouth, and I will teach thee what thou shalt speak." At other times the impediment cannot be removed, neither by the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> appointing nor by the one appointed--for instance, if an archbishop be unable to dispense from an <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a>; wherefore a subject, if <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregular</a>, would not be bound to obey him by accepting the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopate</a> or even sacred orders.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is not in itself <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to accept the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> office, but it becomes <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> by reason of the superior's command. Now one may lawfully place an obstacle to things thus <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, before the command is given; else it would not be lawful to marry a second time, lest one should thus incur an impediment to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopate</a> or <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> orders. But this would not be lawful in things <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Hence the Blessed Mark did not act against a precept by cutting off his finger, although it is credible that he did this by the instigation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, without which it would be unlawful for anyone to lay hands on himself. If a man take a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> not to accept the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> office, and by this intend to bind himself not even to accept it in obedience to his superior prelate, his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is unlawful; but if he intend to bind himself, so far as it lies with him, not to seek the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> office, nor to accept it except under urgent <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is lawful, because he <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> to do what it becomes a man to do.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether he that is appointed to the episcopate ought to be better than others?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one who is appointed to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopate</a> ought to be better than others. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>, when about to commit the pastoral office to Peter, asked him if he loved Him more than the others. Now a man is the better through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the more. Therefore it would seem that one ought not to be appointed to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> office except he be better than others.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, Pope Symmachus says (can. Vilissimus I, qu. 1): "A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is of very little worth who though excelling in dignity, excels not in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>." Now he who excels in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> is better. Therefore a man ought not to be appointed to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopate</a> unless he be better than others.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in every genus the lesser are governed by the greater, as corporeal things are governed by things <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, and the lower bodies by the higher, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iii, 3). Now a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is appointed to govern others. Therefore he should be better than others.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a> [Can. Cum dilectus, de Electione] says that "it suffices to choose a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, nor is it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to choose the better <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In designating a man for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> office, something has to be considered on the part of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> designate, and something on the part of the designator. For on the part of the designator, whether by election or by appointment, it is required that he choose such a one as will dispense the divine mysteries faithfully. These should be dispensed for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, according to (<a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 14:12</a>), "Seek to abound unto the edifying of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>"; and the divine mysteries are not committed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> for their own meed, which they should await in the life to come. Consequently he who has to choose or appoint one for a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is not bound to take one who is best simply, i.e. according to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, but one who is best for governing the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, one namely who is able to instruct, defend, and govern the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> peacefully. Hence <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, commenting on <a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse5">Titus 1:5</a>, says against certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> that "some seek to erect as pillars of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, not those whom they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to be more useful to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but those whom they love more, or those by whose obsequiousness they have been cajoled or undone, or for whom some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in authority has spoken, and, not to say worse than this, have succeeded by means of <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> in being made <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>."

<p>Now this pertains to the respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, which in such matters is a grave <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Wherefore a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [Ep. clxvii ad Hieron.] on (<a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse1">James 2:1</a>), "Brethren, have not . . . with respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>," says: "If this distinction of sitting and standing be referred to ecclesiastical honors, we must not deem it a slight <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to 'have the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> with respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.' For who would suffer a rich <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be chosen for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> seat of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, in despite of a poor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who is better instructed and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holier</a>?"

<p>On the part of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> appointed, it is not required that he esteem himself better than others, for this would be <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> and presumptuous; but it suffices that he perceive nothing in himself which would make it unlawful for him to take up the office of prelate. Hence although Peter was asked by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> if he loved Him more than the others, he did not, in his reply, set himself before the others, but answered simply that he loved <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that, by His own bestowal, Peter was in other respects fitted to govern the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: wherefore He questioned him about his greater love, to show that when we find a man otherwise fitted for the government of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, we must look chiefly to his pre-eminence in the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This statement refers to the pursuits of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who is placed in authority. For he should aim at showing himself to be more excellent than others in both <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Pastor. ii, 1) "the occupations of a prelate ought to excel those of the people, as much as the shepherd's life excels that of his flock." But he is not to be blamed and looked upon as worthless if he excelled not before being raised to the prelacy.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> According to (<a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse4">1 Corinthians 12:4</a>) seqq., "there are diversities of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> . . . and . . . of ministries . . . and . . . of operations." Hence nothing hinders one from being more fitted for the office of governing, who does not excel in the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. It is otherwise in the government of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order, where that which is higher in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order is for that very reason more fitted to dispose of those that are lower.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether a bishop may lawfully forsake the episcopal cure, in order to enter religion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> cannot lawfully forsake his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> cure in order to enter religion. For no one can lawfully pass from a more perfect to a less perfect state; since this is "to look back," which is condemned by the words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> (<a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse62">Luke 9:62</a>), "No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> putting his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>." Now the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> state is more perfect than the religious, as shown above (Question 184, Article 07). Therefore just as it is unlawful to return to the world from the religious state, so is it unlawful to pass from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> to the religious state.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the order of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is more congruous than the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> a thing is not moved in contrary directions; thus if a stone be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> moved downwards, it cannot <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> return upwards from below. But according to the order of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> it is lawful to pass from the religious to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> state. Therefore it is not lawful to pass contrariwise from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> to the religious state.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in the works of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> nothing should be inoperative. Now when once a man is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> he retains in perpetuity the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power of giving orders and doing like things that pertain to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> office: and this power would seemingly remain inoperative in one who gives up the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> cure. Therefore it would seem that a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may not forsake the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> cure and enter religion.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is compelled to do what is in itself unlawful. Now those who seek to resign their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> cure are compelled to resign (Extra, de Renunt. cap. Quidam). Therefore apparently it is not unlawful to give up the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> cure.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The perfection of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> state consists in this that for love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> a man binds himself to work for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of his neighbor, wherefore he is bound to retain the pastoral cure so long as he is able to procure the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> welfare of the subjects entrusted to his care: a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> which he must not neglect--neither for the sake of the quiet of divine <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>, on account of the needs of his subjects, suffered patiently to be delayed even from the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the life to come, according to <a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse22">Philippians 1:22-25</a>, "What I shall choose I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not, but I am straitened between two, having a desire to be dissolved, and to be with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, a thing by far better. But to abide still in the flesh is needful for you. And having this confidence, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I shall abide"; nor for the sake of avoiding any hardships or of acquiring any gain whatsoever, because as it is written (<a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse11">John 10:11</a>), "the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> shepherd giveth his life for his sheep."

<p>At times, however, it happens in several ways that a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is hindered from procuring the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> welfare of his subjects. Sometimes on account of his own defect, either of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> (for instance if he be guilty of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> or <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>), or of body (for example if he be old or infirm), or of <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a> arising, for instance, from bigamy. Sometimes he is hindered through some defect in his subjects, whom he is unable to profit. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Dial. ii, 3): "The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> must be borne patiently, when there are some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> who can be succored, but when there is no profit at all for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it is sometimes useless to labor for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. Wherefore the perfect when they find that they labor in vain are often minded to go elsewhere in order to labor with fruit." Sometimes again this hindrance arises on the part of others, as when <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> results from a certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> being in authority: for the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse13">1 Corinthians 8:13</a>): "If meat <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalize</a> my brother, I will never eat flesh": provided, however, the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> desirous of subverting the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or the righteousness of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; because the pastoral cure is not to be laid aside on account of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> of this kind, according to <a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse14">Matthew 15:14</a>, "Let them alone," those namely who were scandalized at the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> teaching, "they are blind, and leaders of the blind."

<p>Nevertheless just as a man takes upon himself the charge of authority at the appointment of a higher superior, so too it behooves him to be subject to the latter's authority in laying aside the accepted charge for the reasons given above. Hence <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> says (Extra, de Renunt., cap. Nisi cum pridem): "Though thou hast wings wherewith thou art anxious to fly away into solitude, they are so tied by the bonds of authority, that thou art not free to fly without our permission." For the Pope alone can dispense from the perpetual <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, by which a man binds himself to the care of his subjects, when he took upon himself the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> office.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The perfection of religious and that of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are regarded from different standpoints. For it belongs to the perfection of a religious to occupy oneself in working out one's own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, whereas it belongs to the perfection of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to occupy oneself in working for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of others. Hence so long as a man can be useful to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of his neighbor, he would be going back, if he wished to pass to the religious state, to busy himself only with his own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, since he has bound himself to work not only for his own but also for others' <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> says in the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a> quoted above that "it is more easily allowable for a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> to ascend to the episcopacy, than for a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to descend to the monastic life. If, however, he be unable to procure the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of others it is meet he should seek his own."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> On account of no obstacle should a man forego the work of his own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, which pertains to the religious state. But there may be an obstacle to the procuring of another's <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; wherefore a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> may be raised to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> state wherein he is able also to work out his own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. And a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, if he be hindered from procuring the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of others, may enter the religious life, and may return to his bishopric should the obstacle cease, for instance by the correction of his subjects, cessation of the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, healing of his infirmity, removal of his <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> by sufficient instruction. Again, if he owed his promotion to simony of which he was in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and resigning his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopate</a> entered the religious life, he can be reappointed to another bishopric [Cap. Post translat., de Renunt.]. On the other hand, if a man be deposed from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> office for some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and confined in a monastery that he may do penance, he cannot be reappointed to a bishopric. Hence it is stated (VII, qu. i, can. Hoc nequaquam): "The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod orders that any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who has been degraded from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> dignity to the monastic life and a place of repentance, should by no means rise again to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopate</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Even in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things power remains inactive on account of a supervening obstacle, for instance the act of sight ceases through an affliction of the eye. So neither is it unreasonable if, through the occurrence of some obstacle from without, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> power remain without the exercise of its act.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether it is lawful for a bishop on account of bodily persecution to abandon the flock committed to his care?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is unlawful for a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, on account of some temporal <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, to withdraw his bodily presence from the flock committed to his care. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse12">John 10:12</a>) that he is a hireling and no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> shepherd, who "seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep and flieth": and <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xiv in Ev.) that "the wolf comes upon the sheep when any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by his <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> and robbery oppresses the faithful and the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>." Therefore if, on account of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of a tyrant, a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> withdraws his bodily presence from the flock entrusted to his care, it would seem that he is a hireling and not a shepherd.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/pro006.htm#verse1">Proverbs 6:1</a>): "My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, thou hast engaged fast thy hand to a stranger," and afterwards (<a href="../bible/pro006.htm#verse3">Proverbs 6:3</a>): "Run about, make haste, stir up thy friend." <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> expounds these words and says (Pastor. iii, 4): "To be surety for a friend, is to vouch for his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> conduct by engaging oneself to a stranger. And whoever is put forward as an example to the lives of others, is warned not only to watch but even to rouse his friend." Now he cannot do this if he withdraw his bodily presence from his flock. Therefore it would seem that a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> should not on account of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> withdraw his bodily presence from his flock.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it belongs to the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> state that he devote himself to the care of his neighbor. Now it is unlawful for one who has professed the state of perfection to forsake altogether the things that pertain to perfection. Therefore it would seem unlawful for a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to withdraw his bodily presence from the execution of his office, except perhaps for the purpose of devoting himself to works of perfection in a monastery.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> commanded the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, whose successors <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse23">Matthew 10:23</a>): "When they shall persecute you in this city, flee into another."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In any <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> the chief thing to be considered is the end of the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> bind themselves to fulfil the pastoral office for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of their subjects. Consequently when the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of his subjects demands the personal presence of the pastor, the pastor should not withdraw his personal presence from his flock, neither for the sake of some temporal advantage, nor even on account of some impending danger to his <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> shepherd is bound to lay down his life for his sheep.

<p>On the other hand, if the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of his subjects can be sufficiently provided for by another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in the absence of the pastor, it is lawful for the pastor to withdraw his bodily presence from his flock, either for the sake of some advantage to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or on account of some danger to his <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. ccxxviii ad Honorat.): "Christ's servants may flee from one city to another, when one of them is specially sought out by persecutors: in order that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> be not abandoned by others who are not so sought for. When, however, the same danger threatens all, those who stand in need of others must not be abandoned by those whom they need." For "if it is dangerous for the helmsman to leave the ship when the sea is calm, how much more so when it is stormy," as Pope Nicholas I says (cf. VII, qu. i, can. Sciscitaris).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> To flee as a hireling is to prefer temporal advantage or one's bodily welfare to the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> welfare of one's neighbor. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xiv in Ev.): "A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot endanger himself for the sake of his sheep, if he uses his authority over them not through love of them but for the sake of earthly gain: wherefore he <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> to stand in the way of danger lest he lose what he loves." But he who, in order to avoid danger, leaves the flock without endangering the flock, does not flee as a hireling.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> If he who is surety for another be unable to fulfil his engagement, it suffices that he fulfil it through another. Hence if a superior is hindered from attending personally to the care of his subjects, he fulfils his <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> if he do so through another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> When a man is appointed to a bishopric, he embraces the state of perfection as regards one kind of perfection; and if he be hindered from the practice thereof, he is not bound to another kind of perfection, so as to be <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to enter the religious state. Yet he is under the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of retaining the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of devoting himself to his neighbor's <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, should an opportunity offer, and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> require it of him.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether it is lawful for a bishop to have property of his own?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is not lawful for a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to have property of his own. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse21">Matthew 19:21</a>): "If thou wilt be perfect, go sell all [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'what] thou hast, and give to the poor . . . and come, follow Me"; whence it would seem to follow that <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> is requisite for perfection. Now <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are in the state of perfection. Therefore it would seem unlawful for them to possess anything as their own.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> take the place of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on (<a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse1">Luke 10:1</a>). Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> commanded the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> to possess nothing of their own, according to <a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse9">Matthew 10:9</a>, "Do not possess gold, nor silver, nor money in your purses"; wherefore Peter said for himself and the other <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse27">Matthew 19:27</a>): "Behold we have left all things and have followed Thee." Therefore it would seem that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are bound to keep this command, and to possess nothing of their own.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (Ep. lii ad Nepotian.): "The Greek <em>kleros</em> denotes the <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> 'sors.' Hence <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> are so called either because they are of the Lord's estate, or because the Lord Himself is the estate, i.e. portion of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>. Now he that possesses the Lord, can have nothing besides <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and if he have gold and silver, possessions, and chattels of all kinds, with such a portion the Lord does not vouchsafe to be his portion also." Therefore it would seem that not only <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> but even <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> should have nothing of their own.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is stated (XII, qu. i, can. Episcopi de rebus): "Bishops, if they wish, may bequeath to their heirs their personal or acquired property, and whatever belongs to them personally."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> No one is bound to works of supererogation, unless he binds himself specially thereto by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. cxxvii ad Paulin. et Arment.): "Since you have taken the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, you have already bound yourself, you can no longer do otherwise. Before you were bound by the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, you were free to submit." Now it is evident that to live without possessing anything is a work of supererogation, for it is a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> not of precept but of counsel. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> after saying to the young <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: "If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments," said afterwards by way of addition: "If thou wilt be perfect go sell" all "that thou hast, and give to the poor" (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse17">Matthew 19:17-21</a>). Bishops, however, do not bind themselves at their ordination to live without possessions of their own; nor indeed does the pastoral office, to which they bind themselves, make it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for them to live without anything of their own. Therefore <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are not bound to live without possessions of their own.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (184, 3, ad 1) the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> consist in <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, but <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> conduces instrumentally to the perfection of life. Hence it does not follow that where there is greater <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> there is greater perfection; indeed the highest perfection is compatible with great <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, since <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, to whom it was said (<a href="../bible/gen017.htm#verse1">Genesis 17:1</a>): "Walk before Me and be perfect," is stated to have been rich (<a href="../bible/gen013.htm#verse2">Genesis 13:2</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This saying of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> can be understood in three ways. First, mystically, that we should possess neither gold nor silver means that the preacher should not rely chiefly on temporal wisdom and eloquence; thus <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> expounds the passage.

<p>Secondly, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine's</a> explanation (De Consens. Ev. ii, 30), we are to understand that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said this not in command but in permission. For he permitted them to go preaching without gold or silver or other means, since they were to receive the means of livelihood from those to whom they preached; wherefore He added: "For the workman is worthy of his meat." And yet if anyone were to use his own means in preaching the Gospel, this would be a work of supererogation, as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says in reference to himself (<a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 9:12-15</a>).

<p>Thirdly, according to the exposition of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> [Hom. ii in Rom. xvi, 3, we are to understand that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> laid these commands on His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> in reference to the mission on which they were sent to preach to the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, so that they might be encouraged to trust in His power, seeing that He provided for their wants without their having means of their own. But it does not follow from this that they, or their successors, were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to preach the Gospel without having means of their own: since we read of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse8">2 Corinthians 11:8</a>) that he "received wages" of other churches for preaching to the Corinthians, wherefore it is clear that he possessed something sent to him by others. And it seems foolish to say that so many <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> as <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> would have disobeyed these commandments if they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> themselves bound to observe them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Every part is less than the whole. Accordingly a man has other portions together with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if he becomes less intent on things pertaining to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by occupying himself with things of the world. Now neither <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> nor <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> ought thus to possess means of their own, that while busy with their own they neglect those that concern the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether bishops sin mortally if they distribute not to the poor the ecclesiastical goods which accrue to them?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> mortally if they distribute not to the poor the ecclesiastical goods which they acquire. For <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> [<a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a>, Serm. lxiv, de Temp., among the supposititious works of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>] expounding <a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse16">Luke 12:16</a>, "The land of a certain . . . <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> brought forth plenty of fruits," says: "Let no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> claim as his own that which he has taken and obtained by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> from the common property in excess of his requirements"; and afterwards he adds: "It is not less criminal to take from him who has, than, when you are able and have plenty to refuse him who has not." Now it is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to take another's property by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> mortally if they give not to the poor that which they have in excess.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> on (<a href="../bible/isa003.htm#verse14">Isaiah 3:14</a>), "The spoil of the poor is in your house," says that "ecclesiastical goods belong to the poor." Now whoever keeps for himself or gives to others that which belongs to another, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally and is bound to restitution. Therefore if <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> keep for themselves, or give to their relations or friends, their surplus of ecclesiastical goods, it would seem that they are bound to restitution.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, much more may one take what is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for oneself from the goods of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, than accumulate a surplus therefrom. Yet <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says in a letter to Pope Damasus [Cf. Can. Clericos, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. i, qu. 2; Can. Quoniam; <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. xvi, qu. 1; Regul. Monach. iv, among the supposititious works of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>]: "It is right that those <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> who receive no goods from their parents and relations should be supported from the funds of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But those who have sufficient income from their parents and their own possessions, if they take what belongs to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, they commit and incur the guilt of <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a>." Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse1">1 Timothy 5:1</a>)6): "If any of the faithful have <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, let him minister to them, and let not the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> be charged, that there may be sufficient for them that are <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> indeed." Much more therefore do <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> mortally if they give not to the poor the surplus of their ecclesiastical goods.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> do not give their surplus to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, but would seem commendably to lay it out so as to increase the revenue of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The same is not to be said of their own goods which <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> may possess, and of ecclesiastical goods. For they have real dominion over their own goods; wherefore from the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the case they are not bound to give these things to others, and may either keep them for themselves or bestow them on others at will. Nevertheless they may <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in this disposal by inordinate affection, which leads them either to accumulate more than they should, or not to assist others, in accordance with the demands of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; yet they are not bound to restitution, because such things are entrusted to their ownership.

<p>On the other hand, they hold ecclesiastical goods as dispensers or trustees. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. clxxxv ad Bonif.): "If we possess privately what is enough for us, other things belong not to us but to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and we have the dispensing of them; but we can claim ownership of them only by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>." Now dispensing requires <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse2">1 Corinthians 4:2</a>, "Here now it is required among the dispensers that a man be found faithful." Moreover ecclesiastical goods are to be applied not only to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, but also to the divine worship and the needs of its ministers. Hence it is said (XII, qu. ii, can. de reditibus): "Of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> revenues or the offerings of the faithful only one part is to be assigned to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, two parts are to be used by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, under pain of suspension, for the ecclesiastical fabric, and for the benefit of the poor; the remaining part is to be divided among the clergy according to their respective <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>." Accordingly if the goods which are assigned to the use of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> are distinct from those which are appointed for the use of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, or the ministers, or for the ecclesiastical worship, and if the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> keeps back for himself part of that which should be given to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, or to the ministers for their use, or expended on the divine worship, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> he is an unfaithful dispenser, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally, and is bound to restitution.

<p>But as regards those goods which are deputed to his private use, the same apparently applies as to his own property, namely that he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through immoderate attachment thereto or use thereof, if he exceeds moderation in what he keeps for himself, and fails to assist others according to the demands of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p>On the other hand, if no distinction is made in the aforesaid goods, their distribution is entrusted to his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and if he fail or exceed in a slight degree, this may happen without prejudice to his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, because in such matters a man cannot possibly decide precisely what ought to be done. On the other hand, if the excess be very great he cannot be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the fact; consequently he would seem to be lacking in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and is guilty of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse48">Matthew 24:48-51</a>) that "if that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> servant shall say in his heart: My lord is long a-coming," which shows contempt of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> judgment, "and shall begin to strike his fellow-servants," which is a sign of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, "and shall eat and drink with drunkards," which proceeds from <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, "the lord of that servant shall come in a day that he hopeth not . . . and shall separate him," namely from the fellowship of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> men, "and appoint his portion with <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrites</a>," namely in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This saying of <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> refers to the administration not only of ecclesiastical things but also of any goods whatever from which a man is bound, as a <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, to provide for those who are in need. But it is not possible to state definitely when this need is such as to impose an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> under pain of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as is the case in other points of detail that have to be considered in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>: for the decision in such matters is left to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above the goods of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> have to be employed not only for the use of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, but also for other purposes. Hence if a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> wish to deprive himself of that which is assigned to his own use, and give it to his relations or others, he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not so long as he observes moderation, so, to wit, that they cease to be in want without becoming the richer thereby. Hence <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Offic. i, 30): "It is a commendable liberality if you overlook not your kindred when you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them to be in want; yet not so as to wish to make them rich with what you can give to the poor."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The goods of churches should not all be given to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, except in a case of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>: for then, as <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Offic. ii, 28), even the vessels <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the divine worship are to be sold for the ransom of prisoners, and other needs of the poor. On such a case of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> would <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> if he chose to maintain himself on the goods of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, always supposing him to have a patrimony of his own on which to support himself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The goods of the churches should be employed for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the poor. Consequently a man is to be commended if, there being no present <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> for helping the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, he spends the surplus from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> revenue, in buying property, or lays it by for some future use connected with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> or the needs of the poor. But if there be a pressing need for helping the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, to lay by for the future is a superfluous and inordinate saving, and is forbidden by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> Who said (<a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse34">Matthew 6:34</a>): "Be . . . not solicitous for the morrow."

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether religious who are raised to the episcopate are bound to religious observances?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that religious who are raised to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopate</a> are not bound to religious observances. For it is said (XVIII, qu. i, can. Statutum) that a "canonical election loosens a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> from the yoke imposed by the rule of the monastic profession, and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> ordination makes of a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>." Now the regular observances pertain to the yoke of the rule. Therefore religious who are appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are not bound to religious observances.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, he who ascends from a lower to a higher degree is seemingly not bound to those things which pertain to the lower degree: thus it was stated above (88, 12, ad 1) that a religious is not bound to keep the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> he made in the world. But a religious who is appointed to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopate</a> ascends to something greater, as stated above (Question 84, Article 07). Therefore it would seem that a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is not bound to those things whereto he was bound in the state of religion.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, religious would seem to be bound above all to obedience, and to live without property of their own. But religious who are appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, are not bound to obey the superiors of their order, since they are above them; nor apparently are they bound to <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, since according to the decree quoted above (Objection 1) "when the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> ordination has made of a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> he enjoys the right, as the lawful heir, of claiming his paternal inheritance." Moreover they are sometimes allowed to make a will. Much less therefore are they bound to other regular observances.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said in the Decretals (XVI, qu. i, can. De Monachis): "With regard to those who after long residence in a monastery attain to the order of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, we bid them not to lay aside their former purpose."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1, ad 2) the religious state pertains to perfection, as a way of tending to perfection, while the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> state pertains to perfection, as a professorship of perfection. Hence the religious state is compared to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> state, as the school to the professorial chair, and as disposition to perfection. Now the disposition is not voided at the advent of perfection, except as regards what perchance is incompatible with perfection, whereas as to that wherein it is in accord with perfection, it is confirmed the more. Thus when the scholar has become a professor it no longer becomes him to be a listener, but it becomes him to read and meditate even more than before. Accordingly we must assert that if there be among religious observances any that instead of being an obstacle to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> office, are a safeguard of perfection, such as <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, and so forth, a religious, even after he has been made a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, remains bound to observe these, and consequently to wear the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of his order, which is a sign of this <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>.

<p>On the other hand, a man is not bound to keep such religious observances as may be incompatible with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> office, for instance solitude, silence, and certain severe abstinences or watchings and such as would render him bodily unable to exercise the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> office. For the rest he may dispense himself from them, according to the needs of his <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> or office, and the manner of life of those among whom he dwells, in the same way as religious superiors dispense themselves in such matters.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> He who from being a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> becomes a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is loosened from the yoke of the monastic profession, not in everything, but in those that are incompatible with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> office, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of those who are living in the world are compared to the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of religion as the particular to the universal, as stated above (88, 12, ad 1). But the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of religion are compared to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> dignity as disposition to perfection. Now the particular is superfluous when one has the universal, whereas the disposition is still <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> when perfection has been attained.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> that religious who are <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are not bound to obey the superiors of their order, because, to wit, they have ceased to be their subjects; even as those same religious superiors. Nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> remains virtually, so that if any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> be lawfully set above them, they would be bound to obey them, inasmuch as they are bound to obey both the statutes of their rule in the way mentioned above, and their superiors if they have any.

<p>As to property they can nowise have it. For they claim their paternal inheritance not as their own, but as due to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Hence it is added (XVIII, qu. i, can. Statutum) that after he has been ordained <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at the altar to which he is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> and appointed according to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> canons, he must restore whatever he may acquire.

<p>Nor can he make any testament at all, because he is entrusted with the sole administration of things ecclesiastical, and this ends with his death, after which a testament comes into force according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse17">Hebrews 9:17</a>). If, however, by the Pope's permission he make a will, he is not to be understood to bequeath property of his own, but we are to understand that by apostolic authority the power of his administration has been prolonged so as to remain in force after his death.
