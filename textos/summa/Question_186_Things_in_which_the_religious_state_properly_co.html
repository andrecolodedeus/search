<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether religion implies a state of perfection?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that religion does not imply a state of perfection. For that which is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> does not seemingly pertain to perfection. But religion is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, whether because "thereby we are bound [religamur] to the one almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Vera Relig. 55), or because it takes its name from "our returning [religimus] to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Whom we had lost by neglecting Him" [Cf. 81, 1], according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei x, 3). Therefore it would seem that religion does not denote the state of perfection.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, religion according to Tully (De Invent. Rhet. ii, 53) is that "which offers worship and ceremony to the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." Now the offering of worship and ceremony to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would seem to pertain to the ministry of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> orders rather than to the diversity of states, as stated above (40, 2; 183, 3). Therefore it would seem that religion does not denote the state of perfection.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the state of perfection is distinct from the state of beginners and that of the proficient. But in religion also some are beginners, and some are proficient. Therefore religion does not denote the state of perfection.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, religion would seem a place of repentance; for it is said in the Decrees (VII, qu. i, can. Hoc nequaquam): "The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod orders that any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who has been degraded from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> dignity to the monastic life and a place of repentance, should by no means rise again to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopate</a>." Now a place of repentance is opposed to the state of perfection; hence <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Eccl. Hier. vi) places penitents in the lowest place, namely among those who are to be cleansed. Therefore it would seem that religion is not the state of perfection.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> In the Conferences of the Fathers (Collat. i, 7) abbot <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> speaking of religious says: "We must recognize that we have to undertake the hunger of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, watchings, bodily toil, privation, reading, and other acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, in order by these degrees to mount to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>." Now things pertaining to <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> are specified and denominated from the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the end. Therefore religious belong to the state of perfection.

<p>Moreover <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. vi) that those who are called servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by reason of their rendering pure service and subjection to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are united to the perfection beloved of Him.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 141, Article 2) that which is applicable to many things in common is ascribed antonomastically to that to which it is applicable by way of excellence. Thus the name of "<a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>" is claimed by the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which preserves the firmness of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> in regard to most difficult things, and the name of "<a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>," by that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which tempers the greatest pleasures. Now religion as stated above (81, 2; 3, ad 2) is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> whereby a man offers something to the service and worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore those are called religious antonomastically, who give themselves up entirely to the divine service, as offering a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xx in Ezech.): "Some there are who keep nothing for themselves, but sacrifice to almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> their tongue, their senses, their life, and the property they possess." Now the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> consists in adhering wholly to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated above (Question 184, Article 2), and in this sense religion denotes the state of perfection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> To offer something to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, but to offer oneself wholly, and one's possessions to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> belongs to perfection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above (81, 1, ad 1; 4, ad 1, 2; 85, 3) when we were treating of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of religion, religion has reference not only to the offering of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and other like things that are proper to religion, but also to the acts of all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which in so far as these are referred to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> service and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> become acts of religion. Accordingly if a man devotes his whole life to the divine service, his whole life belongs to religion, and thus by reason of the religious life that they lead, those who are in the state of perfection are called religious.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (184, 4,6) religion denotes the state of perfection by reason of the end intended. Hence it does not follow that whoever is in the state of perfection is already perfect, but that he tends to perfection. Hence <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse21">Matthew 19:21</a>, "If thou wilt be perfect," etc., says (Tract. viii in Matth.) that "he who has exchanged <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> for <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> in order to become perfect does not become perfect at the very moment of giving his goods to the poor; but from that day the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will begin to lead him to all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>." Thus all are not perfect in religion, but some are beginners, some proficient.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The religious state was instituted chiefly that we might obtain perfection by means of certain exercises, whereby the obstacles to perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> are removed. By the removal of the obstacles of perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, much more are the occasions of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cut off, for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> destroys <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> altogether. Wherefore since it belongs to penance to cut out the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it follows that the religious state is a most fitting place for penance. Hence (XXXIII, qu. ii, cap. Admonere) a man who had killed his wife is counseled to enter a monastery which is described as "better and lighter," rather than to do public penance while remaining in the world.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether every religious is bound to keep all the counsels?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that every religious is bound to keep all the counsels. For whoever professes a certain state of life is bound to observe whatever belongs to that state. Now each religious professes the state of perfection. Therefore every religious is bound to keep all the counsels that pertain to the state of perfection.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xx in Ezech.) that "he who renounces this world, and does all the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> he can, is like one who has gone out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and offers sacrifice in the wilderness." Now it belongs specially to religious to renounce the world. Therefore it belongs to them also to do all the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> they can. and so it would seem that each of them is bound to fulfil all the counsels.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if it is not requisite for the state of perfection to fulfil all the counsels, it would seem enough to fulfil some of them. But this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, since some who lead a secular life fulfil some of the counsels, for instance those who observe <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>. Therefore it would seem that every religious who is in the state of perfection is bound to fulfil whatever pertains to perfection: and such are the counsels.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> one is not bound, unless one bind oneself, to do works of supererogation. But every religious does not bind himself to keep all the counsels, but to certain definite ones, some to some, others to others. Therefore all are not bound to keep all of them.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing pertains to perfection in three ways. First, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, and thus, as stated above (Question 184, Article 3) the perfect observance of the precepts of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> belongs to perfection. Secondly, a thing belongs to perfection consequently: such are those things that result from the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, for instance to <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> them that curse you (<a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse27">Luke 6:27</a>), and to keep counsels of a like kind, which though they be binding as regards the preparedness of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, so that one has to fulfil them when <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> requires; yet are sometimes fulfilled, without there being any <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, through superabundance of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Thirdly, a thing belongs to perfection instrumentally and dispositively, as <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, abstinence, and the like.

<p>Now it has been stated (1) that the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is the end of the religious state. And the religious state is a school or exercise for the attainment of perfection, which men strive to reach by various practices, just as a physician may use various remedies in order to heal. But it is evident that for him who works for an end it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that he should already have attained the end, but it is requisite that he should by some means tend thereto. Hence he who enters the religious state is not bound to have perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, but he is bound to tend to this, and use his endeavors to have perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p>For the same reason he is not bound to fulfil those things that result from the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, although he is bound to intend to fulfil them: against which <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> he acts if he contemns them, wherefore he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not by omitting them but by contempt of them.

<p>In like manner he is not bound to observe all the practices whereby perfection may be attained, but only those which are definitely prescribed to him by the rule which he has professed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> He who enters religion does not make profession to be perfect, but he professes to endeavor to attain perfection; even as he who enters the schools does not profess to have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but to study in order to acquire <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Wherefore as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei viii, 2), <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagoras</a> was unwilling to profess to be a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but acknowledged himself, "a lover of wisdom." Hence a religious does not violate his profession if he be not perfect, but only if he despises to tend to perfection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as, though all are bound to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with their whole heart, yet there is a certain wholeness of perfection which cannot be omitted without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and another wholeness which can be omitted without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (184, 2, ad 3), provided there be no contempt, as stated above (ad 1), so too, all, both religious and seculars, are bound, in a certain measure, to do whatever <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> they can, for to all without exception it is said (<a href="../bible/ecc009.htm#verse1">Ecclesiastes 9:1</a>)0): "Whatsoever thy hand is able to do, do it earnestly." Yet there is a way of fulfilling this precept, so as to avoid <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, namely if one do what one can as required by the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of one's state of life: provided there be no contempt of doing better things, which contempt sets the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> against <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> progress.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There are some counsels such that if they be omitted, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> whole life would be taken up with secular business; for instance if he have property of his own, or enter the <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> state, or do something of the kind that regards the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of religion themselves; wherefore religious are bound to keep all such like counsels. Other counsels there are, however, about certain particular better actions, which can be omitted without one's life being taken up with secular actions; wherefore there is no need for religious to be bound to fulfil all of them.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether poverty is required for religious perfection?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> is not required for religious perfection. For that which it is unlawful to do does not apparently belong to the state of perfection. But it would seem to be unlawful for a man to give up all he possesses; since the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/2co008.htm#verse12">2 Corinthians 8:12</a>) lays down the way in which the faithful are to give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> saying: "If the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> be forward, it is accepted according to that which a man hath," i.e. "you should keep back what you need," and afterwards he adds (<a href="../bible/2co008.htm#verse13">2 Corinthians 8:13</a>): "For I mean not that others should be eased, and you burthened," i.e. "with <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>," according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a>. Moreover a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse8">1 Timothy 6:8</a>, "Having food, and wherewith to be covered," says: "Though we brought nothing, and will carry nothing away, we must not give up these temporal things altogether." Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> is not requisite for religious perfection.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whosoever exposes himself to danger <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But he who renounces all he has and embraces <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> exposes himself to danger--not only <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, according to <a href="../bible/pro030.htm#verse9">Proverbs 30:9</a>, "Lest perhaps . . . being compelled by <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, I should steal and forswear the name of my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," and <a href="../bible/sir027.htm#verse1">Sirach 27:1</a>, "Through <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> many have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>"--but also corporal, for it is written (<a href="../bible/ecc007.htm#verse13">Ecclesiastes 7:13</a>): "As wisdom is a defense, so money is a defense," and the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 1) that "the waste of property appears to be a sort of ruining of one's self, since thereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> lives." Therefore it would seem that <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> is not requisite for the perfection of religious life.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "Virtue observes the mean," as stated in Ethic. ii, 6. But he who renounces all by <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> seems to go to the extreme rather than to observe the mean. Therefore he does not act virtuously: and so this does not pertain to the perfection of life.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the ultimate perfection of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> consists in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> conduce to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>; for it is written (<a href="../bible/sir031.htm#verse8">Sirach 31:8</a>): "Blessed is the rich <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that is found without blemish," and the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. i, 8) that "<a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> contribute instrumentally to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> is not requisite for religious perfection.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> state is more perfect than the religious state. But <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> may have property, as stated above (Question 185, Article 6). Therefore religious may also.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, almsgiving is a work most acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. ix in Ep. ad Hebr.) "is a most effective remedy in repentance." Now <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> excludes <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsgiving</a>. Therefore it would seem that <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> does not pertain to religious perfection.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. viii, 26): "There are some of the righteous who bracing themselves up to lay hold of the very height of perfection, while they aim at higher objects within, abandon all things without." Now, as stated above, (1 and 2), it belongs properly to religious to brace themselves up in order to lay hold of the very height of perfection. Therefore it belongs to them to abandon all outward things by <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), the religious state is an exercise and a school for attaining to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For this it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that a man wholly withdraw his affections from worldly things; since <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. x, 29), speaking to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: "Too little doth he love Thee, who loves anything with Thee, which he loveth not for Thee." Wherefore he says (QQ. lxxxiii, qu. 36) that "greater <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> means less cupidity, perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> means no cupidity." Now the possession of worldly things draws a man's mind to the love of them: hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. xxxi ad Paulin. et Theras.) that "we are more firmly attached to earthly things when we have them than when we desire them: since why did that young <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> go away sad, save because he had great <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>? For it is one thing not to wish to lay hold of what one has not, and another to renounce what one already has; the former are rejected as foreign to us, the latter are cut off as a limb." And <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. lxiii in Matth.) that "the possession of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> kindles a greater flame and the desire for it becomes stronger."

<p>Hence it is that in the attainment of the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> the first foundation is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, whereby a man lives without property of his own, according to the saying of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse21">Matthew 19:21</a>), "If thou wilt be perfect, go, sell all [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'what'] thou hast, and give to the poor . . . and come, follow Me."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> adds, "when the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> said this (namely "not that you should be burthened," i.e. with <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>)," he did not mean that "it were better not to give: but he feared for the weak, whom he admonished so to give as not to suffer privation." Hence in like manner the other <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> means not that it is unlawful to renounce all one's temporal goods, but that this is not required of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Offic. i, 30): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> does not wish," namely does not command us "to pour out our <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> all at once, but to dispense it; or perhaps to do as did Eliseus who slew his oxen, and fed the poor with that which was his own so that no household care might hold him back."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> He who renounces all his possessions for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake exposes himself to no danger, neither <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> nor corporal. For <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> danger ensues from <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> when the latter is not <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>; because those who are unwillingly poor, through the desire of money-getting, fall into many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, according to (<a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse9">1 Timothy 6:9</a>), "They that will become rich, fall into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> and into the snare of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>." This attachment is put away by those who embrace <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, but it gathers strength in those who have <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, as stated above. Again bodily danger does not threaten those who, intent on following <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, renounce all their possessions and entrust themselves to <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 17): "Those who seek first the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> and His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> are not weighed down by anxiety lest they lack what is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. ii, 6), the mean of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is taken according to right reason, not according to the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of a thing. Consequently whatever may be done in accordance with right reason is not rendered <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> by the greatness of the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, but all the more <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>. It would, however, be against right reason to throw away all one's possessions through intemperance, or without any useful purpose; whereas it is in accordance with right reason to renounce <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> in order to devote oneself to the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of wisdom. Even certain <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> are said to have done this; for <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (Ep. xlviii ad Paulin.): "The famous Theban, Crates, once a very wealthy <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, when he was going to Athens to study <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, cast away a large amount of gold; for he considered that he could not possess both gold and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> at the same time." Much more therefore is it according to right reason for a man to renounce all he has, in order perfectly to follow Christ. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (Ep. cxxv ad Rust. Monach.): "Poor thyself, follow Christ poor."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Happiness or felicity is twofold. One is perfect, to which we look forward in the life to come; the other is imperfect, in respect of which some are said to be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> in this life. The <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of this life is twofold, one is according to the active life, the other according to the contemplative life, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> asserts (Ethic. x, 7,8). Now <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> conduces instrumentally to the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of the active life which consists in external actions, because as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. i, 8) "we do many things by friends, by <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, by political influence, as it were by instruments." On the other hand, it does not conduce to the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of the contemplative life, rather is it an obstacle thereto, inasmuch as the anxiety it involves disturbs the quiet of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is most <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to one who contemplates. Hence it is that the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> asserts (Ethic. x, 8) that "for actions many things are needed, but the contemplative <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs no such things," namely external goods, "for his operation; in fact they are obstacles to his <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>."

<p>Man is directed to future <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; and since <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> is an efficient exercise for the attaining of perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, it follows that it is of great avail in acquiring the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse21">Matthew 19:21</a>): "Go, sell all [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'what'] thou hast, and give to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and thou shalt have treasure in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> once they are possessed are in themselves of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to hinder the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, especially by enticing and distracting the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse22">Matthew 13:22</a>) that "the care of this world and the deceitfulness of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> choketh up the word" of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xv in Ev.) by "preventing the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> desire from entering into the heart, they destroy life at its very outset." Consequently it is difficult to safeguard <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> amidst <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>: wherefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse23">Matthew 19:23</a>) that "a rich <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall hardly enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>," which we must understand as referring to one who actually has <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, since He says that this is impossible for him who places his affection in <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, according to the explanation of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> (Hom. lxiii in Matth.), for He adds (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse24">Matthew 19:24</a>): "It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a rich <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>." Hence it is not said simply that the "rich <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" is blessed, but "the rich <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that is found without blemish, and that hath not gone after gold," and this because he has done a difficult thing, wherefore the text continues (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse9">Matthew 19:9</a>): "Who is he? and we will praise him; for he hath done wonderful things in his life," namely by not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> though placed in the midst of them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> state is not directed to the attainment of perfection, but rather to the effect that, in virtue of the perfection which he already has, a man may govern others, by administering not only <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> but also temporal things. This belongs to the active life, wherein many things occur that may be done by means of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> as an instrument, as stated (ad 4). Wherefore it is not required of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who make profession of governing <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flock, that they have nothing of their own, whereas it is required of religious who make profession of learning to obtain perfection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> The renouncement of one's own <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> is compared to almsgiving as the universal to the particular, and as the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a> to the sacrifice. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xx in Ezech.) that those who assist "the needy with the things they possess, by their <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> offer sacrifice, since they offer up something to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and keep back something for themselves; whereas those who keep nothing for themselves offer a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a> which is greater than a sacrifice." Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> also says (Contra Vigilant.): "When you declare that those do better who retain the use of their possessions, and dole out the fruits of their possessions to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, it is not I but the Lord Who answers you; If thou wilt be perfect," etc., and afterwards he goes on to say: "This <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whom you praise belongs to the second and third degree, and we too commend him: provided we acknowledge the first as to be preferred to the second and third." For this reason in order to exclude the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of Vigilantius it is said (De Eccl. Dogm. xxxviii): "It is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thing to give away one's goods by dispensing them to the poor: it is better to give them away once for all with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of following the Lord, and, free of solicitude, to be poor with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>."

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether perpetual continence is required for religious perfection?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that perpetual <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> is not required for religious perfection. For all perfection of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life began with <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Christ's apostles</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> do not appear to have observed <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, as evidenced by Peter, of whose mother-in-<a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> we read <a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse14">Matthew 8:14</a>. Therefore it would seem that perpetual <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> is not requisite for religious perfection.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the first example of perfection is shown to us in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, to whom the Lord said (<a href="../bible/gen017.htm#verse1">Genesis 17:1</a>): "Walk before Me, and be perfect." Now the copy should not surpass the example. Therefore perpetual <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> is not requisite for religious perfection.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that which is required for religious perfection is to be found in every religious order. Now there are some religious who lead a <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> life. Therefore religious perfection does not require perpetual <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/2co007.htm#verse1">2 Corinthians 7:1</a>): "Let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of the flesh and of the spirit, perfecting sanctification in the fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Now cleanness of flesh and spirit is safeguarded by <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, for it is said (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse3">1 Corinthians 7:3</a>)4): "The unmarried <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> thinketh on the things of the Lord that she may be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> both in spirit and in body [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'both in body and in spirit']." Therefore religious perfection requires <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The religious state requires the removal of whatever hinders <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from devoting himself entirely to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> service. Now the use of sexual union hinders the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> from giving itself wholly to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and this for two reasons. First, on account of its vehement delectation, which by frequent repetition increases <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, as also the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> observes (Ethic. iii, 12): and hence it is that the use of venery withdraws the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> from that perfect intentness on tending to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> expresses this when he says (Solil. i, 10): "I consider that nothing so casts down the manly mind from its height as the fondling of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and those bodily contacts which belong to the <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> state." Secondly, because it involves <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in solicitude for the control of his wife, his children, and his temporalities which serve for their upkeep. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse3">1 Corinthians 7:3</a>)2,33): "He that is without a wife is solicitous for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: but he that is with a wife is solicitous for the things of the world, how he may please his wife."

<p>Therefore perpetual <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, as well as <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, is requisite for religious perfection. Wherefore just as Vigilantius was condemned for equaling <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> to <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, so was Jovinian condemned for equaling marriage to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The perfection not only of <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> but also of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> was introduced by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Who said (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse12">Matthew 19:12</a>): "There are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs, for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>," and then added: "He that can take, let him take it." And lest anyone should be deprived of the hope of attaining perfection, he admitted to the state of perfection those even who were <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a>. Now the husbands could not without committing an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> forsake their wives, whereas men could without <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> renounce <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>. Wherefore Peter whom He found <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a>, He severed not from his wife, while "He withheld from marriage John who wished to marry" [Prolog. in Joan. among the supposititious works of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Bono Conjug. xxii), "the <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> of celibacy is better than the <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> of marriage, one of which <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> had in use, both of them in <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. For he lived chastely, and he might have been chaste without marrying, but it was not requisite then." Nevertheless if the patriarchs of old had perfection of mind together with <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> and marriage, which is a mark of the greatness of their <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, this is no reason why any weaker <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> should presume to have such great <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that he can attain to perfection though rich and <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a>; as neither does a man unarmed presume to attack his enemy, because Samson slew many foes with the jaw-bone of an ass. For those fathers, had it been seasonable to observe <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> and <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, would have been most careful to observe them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Such ways of living as admit of the use of marriage are not the religious life simply and absolutely speaking, but in a restricted sense, in so far as they have a certain share in those things that belong to the religious state.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether obedience belongs to religious perfection?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that obedience does not belong to religious perfection. For those things seemingly belong to religious perfection, which are works of supererogation and are not binding upon all. But all are bound to obey their superiors, according to the saying of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse17">Hebrews 13:17</a>), "Obey your <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, and be subject to them." Therefore it would seem that obedience does not belong to religious perfection.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, obedience would seem to belong properly to those who have to be guided by the sense of others, and such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are lacking in discernment. Now the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb005.htm#verse1">Hebrews 5:1</a>)4) that "strong meat is for the perfect, for them who by custom have their senses exercised to the discerning of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." Therefore it would seem that obedience does not belong to the state of the perfect.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if obedience were requisite for religious perfection, it would follow that it is befitting to all religious. But it is not becoming to all; since some religious lead a solitary life, and have no superior whom they obey. Again religious superiors apparently are not bound to obedience. Therefore obedience would seem not to pertain to religious perfection.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, if the <a href="../cathen/11182a.htm">vow of obedience</a> were requisite for religion, it would follow that religious are bound to obey their superiors in all things, just as they are bound to abstain from all venery by their <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>. But they are not bound to obey them in all things, as stated above (Question 104, Article 5), when we were treating of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of obedience. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/11182a.htm">vow of obedience</a> is not requisite for religion.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, those services are most acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> which are done freely and not of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, according to (<a href="../bible/2co009.htm#verse7">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>), "Not with sadness or of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>." Now that which is done out of obedience is done of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of precept. Therefore those <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works are more deserving of praise which are done of one's own accord. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/11182a.htm">vow of obedience</a> is unbecoming to religion whereby men seek to attain to that which is better.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Religious perfection consists chiefly in the imitation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse21">Matthew 19:21</a>, "If thou wilt be perfect, go sell all [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'what'] thou hast, and give to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and follow Me." Now in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> obedience is commended above all according to (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse8">Philippians 2:8</a>), "He became [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'becoming'] obedient unto death." Therefore seemingly obedience belongs to religious perfection.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (A2,3) the religious state is a school and exercise for tending to perfection. Now those who are being instructed or exercised in order to attain a certain end must needs follow the direction of someone under whose control they are instructed or exercised so as to attain that end as <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> under a master. Hence religious need to be placed under the instruction and command of someone as regards things pertaining to the religious life; wherefore it is said (VII, qu. i, can. Hoc nequaquam): "The monastic life denotes subjection and discipleship." Now one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is subjected to another's command and instruction by obedience: and consequently obedience is requisite for religious perfection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> To obey one's superiors in matters that are <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not a work of supererogation, but is common to all: whereas to obey in matters pertaining to the practice of perfection belongs properly to religious. This latter obedience is compared to the former as the universal to the particular. For those who live in the world, keep something for themselves, and offer something to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and in the latter respect they are under obedience to their superiors: whereas those who live in religion give themselves wholly and their possessions to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated above (1 and 3). Hence their obedience is universal.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 1,2), by performing actions we contract certain <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, and when we have acquired the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> we are best able to perform the actions. Accordingly those who have not attained to perfection, acquire perfection by obeying, while those who have already acquired perfection are most ready to obey, not as though they need to be directed to the acquisition of perfection, but as maintaining themselves by this means in that which belongs to perfection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The subjection of religious is chiefly in reference to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who are compared to them as perfecters to perfected, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> states (Eccl. Hier. vi), where he also says that the "monastic order is subjected to the perfecting <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and is taught by their godlike enlightenment." Hence neither hermits nor religious superiors are exempt from obedience to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; and if they be wholly or partly exempt from obedience to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the diocese, they are nevertheless bound to obey the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Sovereign Pontiff</a>, not only in matters affecting all in common, but also in those which pertain specially to religious discipline.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11182a.htm">vow of obedience</a> taken by religious, extends to the disposition of a man's whole life, and in this way it has a certain universality, although it does not extend to all <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> acts. For some of these do not belong to religion, through not being of those things that concern the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of our neighbor, such as rubbing one's beard, lifting a stick from the ground and so forth, which do not come under a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> nor under obedience; and some are contrary to religion. Nor is there any comparison with <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> whereby acts are excluded which are altogether contrary to religion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of coercion makes an act involuntary and consequently deprives it of the character of praise or <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>; whereas the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> which is consequent upon obedience is a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> not of coercion but of a <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, inasmuch as a man is willing to obey, although perhaps he would not be willing to do the thing commanded considered in itself. Wherefore since by the <a href="../cathen/11182a.htm">vow of obedience</a> a man lays himself under the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of doing for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake certain things that are not pleasing in themselves, for this very reason that which he does is the more acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, though it be of less account, because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can give nothing greater to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, than by subjecting his will to another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake. Hence in the Conferences of the Fathers (Coll. xviii, 7) it is stated that "the Sarabaitae are the worst class of monks, because through providing for their own needs without being subject to superiors, they are free to do as they will; and yet day and night they are more busily occupied in work than those who live in monasteries."

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether it is requisite for religious perfection that poverty, continence, and obedience should come under a vow?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is not requisite for religious perfection that the three aforesaid, namely <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, and obedience, should come under a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. For the school of perfection is founded on the principles laid down by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> in formulating perfection (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse21">Matthew 19:21</a>) said: "If thou wilt be perfect, go, sell all [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'what'] thou hast, and give to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>," without any mention of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. Therefore it would seem that a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the school of religion.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is a promise made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, wherefore (<a href="../bible/ecc005.htm#verse3">Ecclesiastes 5:3</a>) the wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> after saying: "If thou hast vowed anything to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, defer not to pay it," adds at once, "for an unfaithful and foolish promise displeaseth Him." But when a thing is being actually given there is no need for a promise. Therefore it suffices for religious perfection that one keep <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, and obedience without. vowing them.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ad Pollent., de Adult. Conjug. i, 14): "The services we render are more pleasing when we might lawfully not render them, yet do so out of love." Now it is lawful not to render a service which we have not vowed, whereas it is unlawful if we have vowed to render it. Therefore seemingly it is more pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to keep <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, and obedience without a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is not requisite for religious perfection.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> the Nazareans were <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> according to <a href="../bible/num006.htm#verse2">Numbers 6:2</a>, "When a man or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> shall make a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to be sanctified and will <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> themselves to the Lord," etc. Now these were a figure of those "who attain the summit of perfection," as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> [Cf. Moral. ii] of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> states. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is requisite for religious perfection.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It belongs to religious to be in the state of perfection, as shown above (Question 174, Article 5). Now the state of perfection requires an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to whatever belongs to perfection: and this <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> consists in binding oneself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by means of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. But it is evident from what has been said (A3,4,5) that <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, and obedience belong to the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life. Consequently the religious state requires that one be bound to these three by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xx in Ezech.): "When a man <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> all his possessions, all his life, all his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, it is a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>"; and afterwards he says that this refers to those who renounce the present world.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> declared that it belongs to the perfection of life that a man follow Him, not anyhow, but in such a way as not to turn back. Wherefore He says again (<a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse62">Luke 9:62</a>): "No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> putting his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>." And though some of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> went back, yet when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> asked (<a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse68">John 6:68-69</a>), "Will you also go away?" Peter answered for the others: "Lord, to whom shall we go?" Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Consensu Ev. ii, 17) that "as Matthew and Mark relate, Peter and Andrew followed Him after drawing their boats on to the beach, not as though they purposed to return, but as following Him at His command." Now this unwavering following of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is made fast by a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>: wherefore a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is requisite for religious perfection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. ii) religious perfection requires that a man give "his whole life" to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But a man cannot actually give <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> his whole life, because that life taken as a whole is not simultaneous but successive. Hence a man cannot give his whole life to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> otherwise than by the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Among other services that we can lawfully give, is our liberty, which is dearer to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> than aught else. Consequently when a man of his own accord deprives himself by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of the liberty of abstaining from things pertaining to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> service, this is most acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. cxxvii ad Paulin. et Arment.): "Repent not of thy <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>; rejoice rather that thou canst no longer do lawfully, what thou mightest have done lawfully but to thy own cost. Happy the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> that compels to better things."

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether it is right to say that religious perfection consists in these three vows?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is not right to say that religious perfection consists in these three <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. For the perfection of life consists of inward rather than of outward acts, according to (<a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse17">Romans 14:17</a>), "The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a> is not meat and drink, but <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and peace and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." Now the <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious vow</a> binds a man to things belonging to perfection. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of inward actions, such as <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and our neighbor, and so forth, should pertain to the religious state, rather than the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, and obedience which refer to outward actions.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the three aforesaid come under the <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious vow</a>, in so far as they belong to the practice of tending to perfection. But there are many other things that religious practice, such as abstinence, watchings, and the like. Therefore it would seem that these three <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> are incorrectly described as pertaining to the state of perfection.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, by the <a href="../cathen/11182a.htm">vow of obedience</a> a man is bound to do according to his superior's command whatever pertains to the practice of perfection. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/11182a.htm">vow of obedience</a> suffices without the two other <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, external goods comprise not only <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> but also honors. Therefore, if religious, by the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, renounce earthly <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, there should be another <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> whereby they may despise worldly honors.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is stated (Extra, de Statu Monach., cap. Cum ad monasterium) that "the keeping of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> and the renouncing of property are affixed to the monastic rule."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The religious state may be considered in three ways. First, as being a practice of tending to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: secondly, as quieting the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind from outward solicitude, according to (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse3">1 Corinthians 7:3</a>)2: "I would have you to be without solicitude": thirdly, as a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a> whereby a man offers himself and his possessions wholly to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and in corresponding manner the religious state is constituted by these three <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>.

<p>First, as regards the practice of perfection a man is required to remove from himself whatever may hinder his affections from tending wholly to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for it is in this that the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> consists. Such hindrances are of three kinds. First, the attachment to external goods, which is removed by the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>; secondly, the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of sensible pleasures, chief among which are venereal pleasures, and these are removed by the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>; thirdly, the inordinateness of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will, and this is removed by the <a href="../cathen/11182a.htm">vow of obedience</a>. On like manner the disquiet of worldly solicitude is aroused in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in reference especially to three things. First, as regards the dispensing of external things, and this solicitude is removed from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>; secondly, as regards the control of wife and children, which is cut away by the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>; thirdly, as regards the disposal of one's own actions, which is eliminated by the <a href="../cathen/11182a.htm">vow of obedience</a>, whereby a man commits himself to the disposal of another.

<p>Again, "a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a> is the offering to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all that one has," according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Hom. xx in Ezech.). Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has a threefold <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. i, 8). First, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of external things, which he wholly offers to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>: secondly, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of his own body, and this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> he offers to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> especially by the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, whereby he renounces the greatest bodily pleasures. the third is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> wholly offers to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the <a href="../cathen/11182a.htm">vow of obedience</a>, whereby he offers <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> his own will by which he makes use of all the powers and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore the religious state is fittingly constituted by the three <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), the end whereunto the <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious vow</a> is directed is the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, since all the interior acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> belong to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> as to their mother, according to (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse4">1 Corinthians 13:4</a>), "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> is patient, is kind," etc. Hence the interior acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, for instance <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, patience, and so forth, do not come under the <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious vow</a>, but this is directed to them as its end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> All other religious observances are directed to the three aforesaid principal <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>; for if any of them are ordained for the purpose of procuring a livelihood, such as labor, questing, and so on, they are to be referred to <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>; for the safeguarding of which religious seek a livelihood by these means. Other observances whereby the body is chastised, such as watching, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, and the like, are directly ordained for the observance of the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>. And such religious observances as regard <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions whereby a man is directed to the end of religion, namely the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and his neighbor (such as reading, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, visiting the sick, and the like), are comprised under the <a href="../cathen/11182a.htm">vow of obedience</a> that applies to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which directs its actions to the end according to the ordering of another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. The distinction of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> belongs to all three <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, as a sign of being bound by them: wherefore the religious <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is given or blessed at the time of profession.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> By obedience a man offers to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> his will, to which though all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs are subject, yet some are subject to it alone in a special manner, namely <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions, since <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> belong also to the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Wherefore in order to restrain the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of carnal pleasures and of external objects of <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, which hinder the perfection of life, there was need for the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> and <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>; but for the ordering of one's own actions accordingly as the state of perfection requires, there was need for the <a href="../cathen/11182a.htm">vow of obedience</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 3), strictly and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> speaking <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is not due save to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Since, however, external goods serve instrumentally for certain acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, the consequence is that a certain <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is given to their excellence especially by the common people who acknowledge none but outward excellence. Therefore since religious tend to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> it becomes them not to renounce the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and all <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men accord to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa138.htm#verse17">Psalm 138:17</a>, "But to me Thy friends, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are made exceedingly honorable." On the other hand, they renounce the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> that is given to outward excellence, by the very fact that they withdraw from a worldly life: hence no special <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is needed for this.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether the vow of obedience is the chief of the three religious vows?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/11182a.htm">vow of obedience</a> is not the chief of the three religious <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. For the perfection of the religious life was inaugurated by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> gave a special counsel of <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>; whereas He is not stated to have given a special counsel of obedience. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> is greater than the <a href="../cathen/11182a.htm">vow of obedience</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/sir026.htm#verse20">Sirach 26:20</a>) that "no price is worthy of a continent <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>." Now the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of that which is more worthy is itself more excellent. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> is more excellent than the <a href="../cathen/11182a.htm">vow of obedience</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the greater a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> the more indispensable it would seem to be. Now the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> and <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> "are so inseparable from the monastic rule, that not even the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Sovereign Pontiff</a> can allow them to be broken," according to a <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a> (De Statu Monach., cap. Cum ad monasterium): yet he can dispense a religious from obeying his superior. Therefore it would seem that the <a href="../cathen/11182a.htm">vow of obedience</a> is less than the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> and <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxv, 14): "Obedience is rightly placed before victims, since by victims another's flesh, but by obedience one's own will, is sacrificed." Now the religious <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> are holocausts, as stated above (1 and 3, ad 6). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/11182a.htm">vow of obedience</a> is the chief of all religious <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11182a.htm">vow of obedience</a> is the chief of the three religious <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, and this for three reasons.

<p>First, because by the <a href="../cathen/11182a.htm">vow of obedience</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> offers <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> something greater, namely his own will; for this is of more account than his own body, which he offers <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, and than external things, which he offers <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>. Wherefore that which is done out of obedience is more acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than that which is done of one's own will, according to the saying of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> (Ep. cxxv ad Rustic Monach.): "My words are intended to teach you not to rely on your own judgment": and a little further on he says: "You may not do what you will; you must eat what you are bidden to eat, you may possess as much as you receive, clothe yourself with what is given to you." Hence <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> is not acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> if it is done of one's own will, according to (<a href="../bible/isa058.htm#verse3">Isaiah 58:3</a>), "Behold in the day of your fast your own <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is found."

<p>Secondly, because the <a href="../cathen/11182a.htm">vow of obedience</a> includes the other <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, but not vice versa: for a religious, though bound by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to observe <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> and <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, yet these also come under obedience, as well as many other things besides the keeping of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> and <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>.

<p>Thirdly, because the <a href="../cathen/11182a.htm">vow of obedience</a> extends properly to those acts that are closely connected with the end of religion; and the more closely a thing is connected with the end, the better it is.

<p>It follows from this that the <a href="../cathen/11182a.htm">vow of obedience</a> is more <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the religious life. For if a man without taking a <a href="../cathen/11182a.htm">vow of obedience</a> were to observe, even by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> and <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, he would not therefore belong to the religious state, which is to be preferred to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> observed even by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>; for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Virgin. xlvi): "No one, methinks, would prefer <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> to the monastic life." [<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> wrote not 'monasterio' but 'martyrio'--to '<a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>'; and <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> quotes the passage correctly above, 124, 3 and 152, 5].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The counsel of obedience was included in the very following of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, since to obey is to follow another's will. Consequently it is more pertinent to perfection than the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, because as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse27">Matthew 19:27</a>, "Behold we have left all things," observes, "Peter added that which is perfect when he said: And have followed Thee."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The words quoted mean that <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> is to be preferred, not to all other acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but to conjugal <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, or to external <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> of gold and silver which are measured by weight ['Pondere,' referring to the <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> 'ponderatio' in the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay version</a> renders 'price.']. Or again <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> is taken in a general sense for abstinence from ali <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as stated above (155, 4, ad 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The Pope cannot dispense a religious from his <a href="../cathen/11182a.htm">vow of obedience</a> so as to release him from obedience to every superior in matters relating to the perfection of life, for he cannot exempt him from obedience to himself. He can, however, exempt him from subjection to a lower superior, but this is not to dispense him from his <a href="../cathen/11182a.htm">vow of obedience</a>.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether a religious sins mortally whenever he transgresses the things contained in his rule?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a religious <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally whenever he transgresses the things contained in his rule. For to break a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> worthy of condemnation, as appears from (<a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse1">1 Timothy 5:1</a>)1,12, where the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says that <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> who "will marry have [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'having'] damnation, because they have made void their first <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>." But religious are bound to a rule by the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of their profession. Therefore they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> mortally by transgressing the things contained in their rule.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the rule is enjoined upon a religious in the same way as a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Now he who transgresses a precept of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally. Therefore it would seem that a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally if he transgresses the things contained in his rule.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, contempt involves a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now whoever repeatedly does what he ought not to do seems to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from contempt. Therefore it would seem that a religious <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally by frequently transgressing the things contained in his rule.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The religious state is safer than the secular state; wherefore <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> at the beginning of his Morals [Epist. Missoria, ad Leand. Episc. i] compares the secular life to the stormy sea, and the religious life to the calm port. But if every transgression of the things contained in his rule were to involve a religious in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the religious life would be fraught with danger of account of its multitude of observances. Therefore not every transgression of the things contained in the rule is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1, ad 1,2), a thing is contained in the rule in two ways. First, as the end of the rule, for instance things that pertain to the acts of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; and the transgression of these, as regards those which come under a common precept, involves a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but as regards those which are not included in the common <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of a precept, the transgression thereof does not involve a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, except by reason of contempt, because, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), a religious is not bound to be perfect, but to tend to perfection, to which the contempt of perfection is opposed.

<p>Secondly, a thing is contained in the rule through pertaining to the outward practice, such as all external observances, to some of which a religious is bound by the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of his profession. Now the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of profession regards chiefly the three things aforesaid, namely <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, and obedience, while all others are directed to these. Consequently the transgression of these three involves a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, while the transgression of the others does not involve a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, except either by reason of contempt of the rule (since this is directly contrary to the profession whereby a man <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> to live according to the rule), or by reason of a precept, whether given orally by a superior, or expressed in the rule, since this would be to act contrary to the <a href="../cathen/11182a.htm">vow of obedience</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> He who professes a rule does not <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to observe all the things contained in the rule, but he <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> the regular life which consists <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> in the three aforesaid things. Hence in certain religious orders precaution is taken to profess, not the rule, but to live according to the rule, i.e. to tend to form one's conduct in accordance with the rule as a kind of model; and this is set aside by contempt. Yet greater precaution is observed in some religious orders by professing obedience according to the rule, so that only that which is contrary to a precept of the rule is contrary to the profession, while the transgression or omission of other things binds only under pain of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because, as stated above (07, ad 2), such things are dispositions to the chief <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. And venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a disposition to mortal, as stated above (I-II, 88, 3), inasmuch as it hinders those things whereby a man is disposed to keep the chief precepts of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, namely the precepts of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p>There is also a religious order, that of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Friars Preachers</a>, where such like transgressions or omissions do not, by their very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, involve <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, either mortal or venial; but they bind one to suffer the punishment affixed thereto, because it is in this way that they are bound to observe such things. Nevertheless they may <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> venially or mortally through neglect, <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, or contempt.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Not all the contents of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> are set forth by way of precept; for some are expressed under the form of ordinance or statute binding under pain of a fixed punishment. Accordingly, just as in the <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> the transgression of a legal statute does not always render a man deserving of bodily death, so neither in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does every ordinance or statute bind under mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and the same applies to the statutes of the rule.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> An action or transgression proceeds from contempt when a man's will refuses to submit to the ordinance of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> or rule, and from this he proceeds to act against the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> or rule. on the other hand, he does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from contempt, but from some other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, when he is led to do something against the ordinance of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> or rule through some particular <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> such as <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> or <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, even though he often repeat the same kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through the same or some other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Thus <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Nat. et Grat. xxix) that "not all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are committed through <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> contempt." Nevertheless the frequent repetition of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> leads dispositively to contempt, according to the words of (<a href="../bible/pro018.htm#verse3">Proverbs 18:3</a>), "The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, when he is come into the depth of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, contemneth."

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether a religious sins more grievously than a secular by the same kind of sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a religious does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> more grievously than a secular by the same kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/2ch030.htm#verse18">2 Chronicles 30:18-19</a>): "The Lord Who is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will show mercy to all them who with their whole heart seek the Lord the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of their fathers, and will not impute it to them that they are not sanctified." Now religious apparently follow the Lord the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of their fathers with their whole heart rather than seculars, who partly give themselves and their possessions to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and reserve part for themselves, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xx in Ezech.). Therefore it would seem that it is less imputed to them if they fall short somewhat of their sanctification.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is less angered at a man's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> if he does some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, according to (<a href="../bible/2ch019.htm#verse2">2 Chronicles 19:2</a>),3, "Thou helpest the ungodly, and thou art joined in friendship with them that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the Lord, and therefore thou didst deserve indeed the wrath of the Lord: but <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works are found in thee." Now religious do more <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works than seculars. Therefore if they commit any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is less <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with them.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, this present life is not carried through without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to (<a href="../bible/jam003.htm#verse2">James 3:2</a>), "In many things we all offend." Therefore if the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of religious were more grievous than those of seculars it would follow that religious are worse off than seculars: and consequently it would not be a wholesome counsel to enter religion.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The greater the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> the more it would seem to be deplored. But seemingly the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of those who are in the state of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and perfection are the most deplorable, for it is written (<a href="../bible/jer023.htm#verse9">Jeremiah 23:9</a>): "My heart is broken within me," and afterwards (<a href="../bible/jer023.htm#verse11">Jeremiah 23:11</a>): "For the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> are defiled; and in My house I have found their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>." Therefore religious and others who are in the state of perfection, other things being equal, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> more grievously.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed by a religious may be in three ways more grievous than a like <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed by a secular. First, if it be against his <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious vow</a>; for instance if he be guilty of fornication or <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>, because by fornication he acts against the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, and by <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>; and not merely against a precept of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">divine law</a>. Secondly, if he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> out of contempt, because thereby he would seem to be the more ungrateful for the divine favors which have raised him to the state of perfection. Thus the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse29">Hebrews 10:29</a>) that the believer "deserveth worse punishments" who through contempt tramples under foot the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Hence the Lord complains (<a href="../bible/jer011.htm#verse15">Jeremiah 11:15</a>): "What is the meaning that My beloved hath wrought much <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> in My house?" Thirdly, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of a religious may be greater on account of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, because many take note of his manner of life: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/jer023.htm#verse14">Jeremiah 23:14</a>): "I have seen the likeness of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulterers</a>, and the way of lying in the Prophets of Jerusalem; and they strengthened the hands of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should return from his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> doings."

<p>On the other hand, if a religious, not out of contempt, but out of weakness or <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, commit a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that is not against the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of his profession, without giving <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> (for instance if he commit it in secret) he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> less grievously in the same kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than a secular, because his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> if slight is absorbed as it were by his many <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works, and if it be mortal, he more easily recovers from it. First, because he has a right <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and though it be intercepted for the moment, it is easily restored to its former object. Hence <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> commenting on <a href="../bible/psa036.htm#verse24">Psalm 36:24</a>, "When he shall fall he shall not be bruised," says (Hom. iv in Ps. 36): "The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, if he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, repents not, and fails to make amends for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But the just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to make amends and recover himself; even as he who had said: 'I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>,' shortly afterwards when the Lord had looked on him, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> to shed most bitter tears, and he who from the roof had seen a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and desired her <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> to say: 'I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> and done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> before Thee.'" Secondly, he is assisted by his fellow-religious to rise again, according to <a href="../bible/ecc004.htm#verse10">Ecclesiastes 4:10</a>, "If one fall he shall be supported by the other: woe to him that is alone, for when he falleth he hath none to lift him up."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The words quoted refer to things done through weakness or <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, but not to those that are done out of contempt.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Josaphat also, to whom these words were addressed, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> not out of contempt, but out of a certain weakness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The just <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not easily out of contempt; but sometimes they fall into a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or weakness from which they easily arise. If, however, they go so far as to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> out of contempt, they become most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and incorrigible, according to the word of <a href="../bible/jer002.htm#verse20">Jeremiah 2:20</a>: "Thou hast broken My yoke, thou hast burst My bands, and thou hast said: 'I will not serve.' For on every high hill and under every green tree thou didst prostitute thyself." Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. lxxviii ad Pleb. Hippon.): "From the time I began to serve <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even as I scarcely found better men than those who made progress in monasteries, so have I not found worse than those who in the monastery have fallen."
