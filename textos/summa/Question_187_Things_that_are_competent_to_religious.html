<ol><li><a href="../summa/3187.htm#article1"> Is it lawful for them to teach, preach, and do like things?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3187.htm#article2"> Is it lawful for them to meddle in secular business?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3187.htm#article3"> Are they bound to manual labor?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3187.htm#article4"> Is it lawful for them to live on alms?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3187.htm#article5"> Is it lawful for them to quest?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3187.htm#article6"> Is it lawful for them to wear coarser clothes than other persons?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether it is lawful for religious to teach, preach, and the like?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem unlawful for religious to teach, preach, and the like. For it is said (VII, qu. i, can. Hoc nequaquam) in an ordinance of a synod of Constantinople [Pseudosynod held by Photius in the year 879]: "The monastic life is one of subjection and discipleship, not of teaching, authority, or pastoral care." And <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (ad Ripar. et Desider. [Contra Vigilant. xvi]): "A <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk's</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> is not to teach but to lament." Again <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Pope Leo [Leo I</a>, Ep. cxx ad Theodoret., 6, cf. XVI, qu. i, can. Adjicimus]: says "Let none dare to preach save the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the Lord, be he <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> or <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, and no <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> what <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> he may boast of having." Now it is not lawful to exceed the bounds of one's office or transgress the ordinance of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Therefore seemingly it is unlawful for religious to teach, preach, and the like.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in an ordinance of the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicea</a> (cf. XVI, qu. i, can. Placuit) it is laid down as follows: "It is our absolute and peremptory command addressed to all that <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> shall not hear confessions except of one another, as is right, that they shall not bury the dead except those dwelling with them in the monastery, or if by chance a brother happen to die while on a visit." But just as the above belong to the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, so also do preaching and teaching. Therefore since "the business of a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> differs from that of a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>," as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (Ep. xiv ad Heliod.), it would seem unlawful for religious to preach, teach, and the like.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Regist. v, Ep. 1): "No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can fulfil ecclesiastical duties, and keep consistently to the monastic rule": and this is quoted XVI, qu. i, can. Nemo potest. Now <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> are bound to keep consistently to the monastic rule. Therefore it would seem that they cannot fulfil ecclesiastical duties, whereof teaching and preaching are a part. Therefore seemingly it is unlawful for them to preach, teach, and do similar things.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> is quoted (XVI, qu. i, can. Ex auctoritate) as saying: "By authority of this decree framed in virtue of our apostolic power and the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of our office, be it lawful to <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who are configured to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, to preach, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, give communion, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for sinners, impose penance, and <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing is declared to be unlawful to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in two ways. First, because there is something in him contrary to that which is declared unlawful to him: thus to no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is it lawful to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because each <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has in himself reason and an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">God's law</a>, to which things <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is contrary. And in this way it is said to be unlawful for a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to preach, teach, or do like things, because there is in him something incompatible with these things, either by reason of a precept--thus those who are <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregular</a> by ordinance of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> may not be raised to the sacred orders--or by reason of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa049.htm#verse16">Psalm 49:16</a>, "But to the sinner <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath said: Why dost thou declare My <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>?"

<p>In this way it is not unlawful for religious to preach, teach, and do like things, both because they are bound neither by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> nor by precept of their rule to abstain from these things, and because they are not rendered less apt for these things by any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed, but on the contrary they are the more apt through having taken upon themselves the practice of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. For it is foolish to say that a man is rendered less fit for <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> duties through advancing himself in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>; and consequently it is foolish to declare that the religious state is an obstacle to the fulfilment of such like duties. This <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is rejected by Pope Boniface [Boniface IV] for the reasons given above. His words which are quoted (XVI, qu. i, can. Sunt. nonnulli) are these: "There are some who without any dogmatic <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, and with extreme daring, inspired with a zeal rather of bitterness than of love, assert that <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> though they be dead to the world and live to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are unworthy of the power of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> office, and that they cannot confer penance, nor christen, nor <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> in virtue of the power divinely bestowed on them in the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> office. But they are altogether wrong." He proves this first because it is not contrary to the rule; thus he continues: "For neither did the Blessed Benedict the saintly teacher of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> forbid this in any way," nor is it forbidden in other rules. Secondly, he refutes the above <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> from the usefulness of the monks, when he adds at the end of the same chapter: "The more perfect a man is, the more effective is he in these, namely in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> works."

<p>Secondly, a thing is said to be unlawful for a man, not on account of there being in him something contrary thereto, but because he lacks that which enables him to do it: thus it is unlawful for a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> to say mass, because he is not in <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> orders; and it is unlawful for a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to deliver judgment because he lacks the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> authority. Here, however, a distinction must be made. Because those things which are a matter of an order, cannot be deputed to one who has not the order, whereas matters of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> can be deputed to those who have not ordinary <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>: thus the delivery of a judgment is deputed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to a simple <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. On this sense it is said to be unlawful for <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and other religious to preach, teach, and so forth, because the religious state does not give them the power to do these things. They can, however, do them if they receive orders, or ordinary <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, or if matters of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> be delegated to them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It results from the words quoted that the fact of their being <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> does not give <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> the power to do these things, yet it does not involve in them anything contrary to the performance of these acts.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Again, this ordinance of the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicea</a> forbids <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to claim the power of exercising those acts on the ground of their being monks, but it does not forbid those acts being delegated to them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> These two things are incompatible, namely, the ordinary cure of ecclesiastical duties, and the observance of the monastic rule in a monastery. But this does not prevent <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and other religious from being sometimes occupied with ecclesiastical duties through being deputed thereto by superiors having ordinary cure; especially members of religious orders that are especially instituted for that purpose, as we shall say further on (188, 4).

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether it is lawful for religious to occupy themselves with secular business?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem unlawful for religious to occupy themselves with secular business. For in the decree quoted above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>) of Pope Boniface it is said that the "Blessed Benedict bade them to be altogether free from secular business; and this is most explicitly prescribed by the apostolic doctrine and the teaching of all the Fathers, not only to religious, but also to all the canonical clergy," according to (<a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse4">2 Timothy 2:4</a>), "No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> being a soldier to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, entangleth himself with secular business." Now it is the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of all religious to be soldiers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore it is unlawful for them to occupy themselves with secular business.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1th004.htm#verse11">1 Thessalonians 4:11</a>): "That you use your endeavor to be quiet, and that you do your own business," which a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> explains thus--"by refraining from other people's affairs, so as to be the better able to attend to the amendment of your own life." Now religious devote themselves in a special way to the amendment of their life. Therefore they should not occupy themselves with secular business.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse8">Matthew 11:8</a>, "Behold they that are clothed in soft garments are in the houses of kings," says: "Hence we gather that an austere life and severe preaching should avoid the palaces of kings and the mansions of the voluptuous." But the needs of secular business induce men to frequent the palaces of kings. Therefore it is unlawful for religious to occupy themselves with secular business.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom016.htm#verse1">Romans 16:1</a>): "I commend to you Phoebe our Sister," and further on (<a href="../bible/rom016.htm#verse2">Romans 16:2</a>), "that you assist her in whatsoever business she shall have need of you."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (186, 1 and 7, ad 1), the religious state is directed to the attainment of the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, consisting principally in the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and secondarily in the love of our neighbor. Consequently that which religious intend chiefly and for its own sake is to give themselves to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Yet if their neighbor be in need, they should attend to his affairs out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, according to (<a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse2">Galatians 6:2</a>), "Bear ye one another's burthens: and so you shall fulfil the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>," since through serving their neighbor for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake, they are obedient to the divine love. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse2">James 1:2</a>)7): "Religion clean and undefiled before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the Father, is this: to visit the fatherless and <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> in their tribulation," which means, according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a>, to assist the helpless in their time of need.

<p>We must conclude therefore that it is unlawful for either <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> or <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> to carry on secular business from motives of avarice; but from motives of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and with their superior's permission, they may occupy themselves with due moderation in the administration and direction of secular business. Wherefore it is said in the Decretals (Dist. xxxviii, can. Decrevit): "The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod decrees that henceforth no <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> shall buy property or occupy himself with secular business, save with a view to the care of the fatherless, orphans, or <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, or when the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city commands him to take charge of the business connected with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>." And the same applies to religious as to <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, because they are both debarred from secular business on the same grounds, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Monks are forbidden to occupy themselves with secular business from motives of avarice, but not from motives of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> To occupy oneself with secular business on account of another's need is not officiousness but <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> To haunt the palaces of kings from motives of pleasure, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, or avarice is not becoming to religious, but there is nothing unseemly in their visiting them from motives of piety. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/2ki004.htm#verse13">2 Kings 4:13</a>): "Hast thou any business, and wilt thou that I speak to the king or to the general of the army?" Likewise it becomes religious to go to the palaces of kings to rebuke and guide them, even as <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a> rebuked Herod, as related in <a href="../bible/mat014.htm#verse4">Matthew 14:4</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether religious are bound to manual labor?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that religious are bound to manual labor. For religious are not exempt from the observance of precepts. Now manual labor is a matter of precept according to (<a href="../bible/1th004.htm#verse11">1 Thessalonians 4:11</a>), "Work with your own hands as we commanded you"; wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De oper. Monach. xxx): "But who can allow these insolent men," namely religious that do no work, of whom he is speaking there, "who disregard the most salutary admonishment of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>, not merely to be borne with as being weaker than others, but even to preach as though they were <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holier</a> than others." Therefore it would seem that religious are bound to manual labor.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> [<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, (De oper. Monach. xxi)] on (<a href="../bible/2th003.htm#verse10">2 Thessalonians 3:10</a>), "If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will not work, neither let him eat," says: "Some say that this command of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> refers to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> works, and not to the bodily labor of the farmer or craftsman"; and further on: "But it is useless for them to try to hide from themselves and from others the fact that they are unwilling not only to fulfil, but even to understand the useful admonishments of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>"; and again: "He wishes <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> servants to make a living by working with their bodies." Now religious especially are called servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because they give themselves entirely to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> asserts (Eccl. Hier. vi). Therefore it would seem that they are bound to manual labor.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De oper. Monach. xvii): "I would fain <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how they would occupy themselves, who are unwilling to work with their body. We occupy our time, say they, with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, psalms, reading, and the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Yet these things are no excuse, and he proves this, as regards each in particular. For in the first place, as to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, he says: "One <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the obedient <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is sooner granted than ten thousand <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the contemptuous": meaning that those are contemptuous and unworthy to be heard who work not with their hands. Secondly, as to the divine praises he adds: "Even while working with their hands they can easily sing hymns to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Thirdly, with regard to reading, he goes on to say: "Those who say they are occupied in reading, do they not find there what the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> commanded? What sort of perverseness is this, to wish to read but not to obey what one reads?" Fourthly, he adds in reference to preaching [Cap. xviii]: "If one has to speak, and is so busy that he cannot spare time for manual work, can all in the monastery do this? And since all cannot do this, why should all make this a pretext for being exempt? And even if all were able, they should do so by turns, not only so that the others may be occupied in other works, but also because it suffices that one speak while many listen." Therefore it would seem that religious should not desist from manual labor on account of such like <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> works to which they devote themselves.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse33">Luke 12:33</a>, "Sell what you possess," says: "Not only give your clothes to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, but sell what you possess, that having once for all renounced all your possessions for the Lord's sake, you may henceforth work with the labor of your hands, so as to have wherewith to live or to give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>." Now it belongs properly to religious to renounce all they have. Therefore it would seem likewise to belong to them to live and give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> through the labor of their hands.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, religious especially would seem to be bound to imitate the life of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, since they profess the state of perfection. Now the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> worked with their own hands, according to (<a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse1">1 Corinthians 4:1</a>)2: "We labor, working with our own hands." Therefore it would seem that religious are bound to manual labor.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Those precepts that are commonly enjoined upon all are equally binding on religious and seculars. But the precept of manual labor is enjoined upon all in common, as appears from <a href="../bible/2th003.htm#verse6">2 Thessalonians 3:6</a>, "Withdraw yourselves from every brother walking disorderly," etc. (for by brother he signifies every <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, according to (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 7:12</a>), "If any brother have a wife that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> not"). Now it is written in the same passage (<a href="../bible/2th003.htm#verse10">2 Thessalonians 3:10</a>): "If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will not work, neither let him eat." Therefore religious are not bound to manual labor any more than seculars are.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Manual labor is directed to four things. First and principally to obtain food; wherefore it was said to the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> (<a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse19">Genesis 3:19</a>): "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread," and it is written (<a href="../bible/psa127.htm#verse2">Psalm 127:2</a>): "For thou shalt eat the labors of thy hands." Secondly, it is directed to the removal of idleness whence arise many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>; hence it is written (<a href="../bible/sir033.htm#verse28">Sirach 33:28</a>),29): "Send" thy <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> "to work, that he be not idle, for idleness hath taught much <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." Thirdly, it is directed to the curbing of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, inasmuch as it is a means of afflicting the body; hence it is written (<a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse5">2 Corinthians 6:5-6</a>): "In labors, in watchings, in fastings, in <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>." Fourthly, it is directed to <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsgiving</a>, wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse28">Ephesians 4:28</a>): "He that stole, let him now steal no more; but rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, that he may have something to give to him that suffereth need." Accordingly, in so far as manual labor is directed to obtaining food, it comes under a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of precept in so far as it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for that end: since that which is directed to an end derives its <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> from that end, being, in effect, so far <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> as the end cannot be obtained without it. Consequently he who has no other means of livelihood is bound to work with his hands, whatever his <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> may be. This is signified by the words of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>: "If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will not work, neither let him eat," as though to say: "The <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of manual labor is the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of meat." So that if one could live without eating, one would not be bound to work with one's hands. The same applies to those who have no other lawful means of livelihood: since a man is understood to be unable to do what he cannot do lawfully. Wherefore we find that the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> prescribed manual labor merely as a remedy for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of those who gained their livelihood by unlawful means. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> ordered manual labor first of all in order to avoid <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>, as appears from (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse28">Ephesians 4:28</a>), "He that stole, let him now steal no more; but rather let him labor, working with his hands." Secondly, to avoid the coveting of others' property, wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/1th004.htm#verse11">1 Thessalonians 4:11</a>): "Work with your own hands, as we commanded you, and that you walk honestly towards them that are without." Thirdly, to avoid the discreditable pursuits whereby some seek a livelihood. Hence he says (<a href="../bible/2th003.htm#verse10">2 Thessalonians 3:10</a>)-12): "When we were with you, this we declared to you: that if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will not work, neither let him eat. For we have heard that there are some among you who walk disorderly, working not at all, but curiously meddling" (namely, as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> explains it, "who make a living by meddling in unlawful things). Now we charge them that are such, and beseech them . . . that working with silence, they would eat their own bread." Hence <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> states (Super epist. ad Galat. [Preface to Bk. ii of Commentary]) that the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> said this "not so much in his capacity of teacher as on account of the faults of the people."

<p>It must, however, be observed that under manual labor are comprised all those <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> occupations whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can lawfully gain a livelihood, whether by using his hands, his feet, or his tongue. For watchmen, couriers, and such like who live by their labor, are understood to live by their handiwork: because, since the hand is "the organ of organs" [De Anima iii, 8], handiwork denotes all kinds of work, whereby a man may lawfully gain a livelihood.

<p>In so far as manual labor is directed to the removal of idleness, or the affliction of the body, it does not come under a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of precept if we consider it in itself, since there are many other means besides manual labor of afflicting the body or of removing idleness: for the flesh is afflicted by fastings and watchings, and idleness is removed by meditation on the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> and by the divine praises. Hence a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/psa118.htm#verse82">Psalm 118:82</a>, "My eyes have failed for Thy word," says: "He is not idle who meditates only on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> word; nor is he who works abroad any better than he who devotes himself to the study of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." Consequently for these reasons religious are not bound to manual labor, as neither are seculars, except when they are so bound by the statutes of their order. Thus <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (Ep. cxxv ad Rustic Monach.): "The Egyptian monasteries are wont to admit none unless they work or labor, not so much for the necessities of life, as for the welfare of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, lest it be led astray by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> thoughts." But in so far as manual labor is directed to <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsgiving</a>, it does not come under the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of precept, save perchance in some particular case, when a man is under an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, and has no other means of having the wherewithal to assist the poor: for in such a case religious would be bound as well as seculars to do manual labor.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This command of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> is of <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>: wherefore a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/2th003.htm#verse6">2 Thessalonians 3:6</a>, "That you withdraw yourselves from every brother walking disorderly," says, "otherwise than the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order requires," and he is speaking of those who abstained from manual labor. Hence <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> has provided <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with hands instead of arms and clothes, with which she has provided other animals, in order that with his hands he may obtain these and all other necessaries. Hence it is clear that this precept, even as all the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, is binding on both religious and seculars alike. Yet not everyone <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that works not with his hands, because those precepts of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> which regard the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the many are not binding on each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, but it suffices that one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> apply himself to this business and another to that; for instance, that some be craftsmen, others husbandmen, others judges, and others teachers, and so forth, according to the words of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse17">1 Corinthians 12:17</a>), "If the whole body were the eye, where would be the hearing? If the whole were the hearing, where would be the smelling?"

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> is taken from <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine's</a> De operibus Monachorum, cap. 21, where he speaks against certain <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who declared it to be unlawful for the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to work with their hands, on account of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> saying (<a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse25">Matthew 6:25</a>): "Be not solicitous for your life, what you shall eat." Nevertheless his words do not imply that religious are bound to work with their hands, if they have other means of livelihood. This is clear from his adding: "He wishes the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to make a living by working with their bodies." Now this does not apply to religious any more than to seculars, which is evident for two reasons. First, on account of the way in which the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> expresses himself, by saying: "That you withdraw yourselves from every brother walking disorderly." For he calls all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> brothers, since at that time religious orders were not as yet founded. Secondly, because religious have no other <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> than what seculars have, except as required by the rule they profess: wherefore if their rule contain nothing about manual labor, religious are not otherwise bound to manual labor than seculars are.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may devote himself in two ways to all the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> works mentioned by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> in the passage quoted: in one way with a view to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, in another with a view to his private advantage. Accordingly those who devote themselves publicly to the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> works are thereby exempt from manual labor for two reasons: first, because it behooves them to be occupied exclusively with such like works; secondly, because those who devote themselves to such works have a claim to be supported by those for whose advantage they work.

<p>On the other hand, those who devote themselves to such works not publicly but privately as it were, ought not on that account to be exempt from manual labor, nor have they a claim to be supported by the offerings of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, and it is of these that <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is speaking. For when he says: "They can sing hymns to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> even while working with their hands; like the craftsmen who give tongue to fable telling without withdrawing their hands from their work," it is clear that he cannot refer to those who sing the canonical hours in the church, but to those who tell psalms or hymns as private <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. Likewise what he says of reading and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is to be referred to the private <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and reading which even <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">lay people</a> do at times, and not to those who perform public <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> in the church, or give public lectures in the schools. Hence he does not say: "Those who say they are occupied in teaching and instructing," but: "Those who say they are occupied in reading." Again he speaks of that preaching which is addressed, not publicly to the people, but to one or a few in particular by way of private admonishment. Hence he says expressly: "If one has to speak." For according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on (<a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse4">1 Corinthians 2:4</a>), "Speech is addressed privately, preaching to many."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Those who despise all for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake are bound to work with their hands, when they have no other means of livelihood, or of almsgiving (should the case occur where almsgiving were a matter of precept), but not otherwise, as stated in the Article. It is in this sense that the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> quoted is to be understood.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> That the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> worked with their hands was sometimes a matter of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, sometimes a work of supererogation. It was of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> when they failed to receive a livelihood from others. Hence a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on (<a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse1">1 Corinthians 4:1</a>)2, "We labor, working with our own hands," adds, "because no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> giveth to us." It was supererogation, as appears from <a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 9:12</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says that he did not use the power he had of living by the Gospel. The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> had recourse to this supererogation for three motives. First, in order to deprive the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> apostles of the pretext for preaching, for they preached merely for a temporal advantage; hence he says (<a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse12">2 Corinthians 11:12</a>): "But what I do, that I will do that I may cut off the occasion from them," etc. Secondly, in order to avoid burdening those to whom he preached; hence he says (<a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse13">2 Corinthians 12:13</a>): "What is there that you have had less than the other churches, but that I myself was not burthensome to you?" Thirdly, in order to give an example of work to the idle; hence he says (<a href="../bible/2th003.htm#verse8">2 Thessalonians 3:8-9</a>): "We worked night and day . . . that we might give ourselves a pattern unto you, to imitate us." However, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> did not do this in places like Athens where he had facilities for preaching daily, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> observes (De oper. Monach. xviii). Yet religious are not for this reason bound to imitate the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> in this matter, since they are not bound to all works of supererogation: wherefore neither did the other <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> work with their hands.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether it is lawful for religious to live on alms?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem unlawful for religious to live on <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse1">1 Timothy 5:1</a>)6) forbids those <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> who have other means of livelihood to live on the <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, so that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> may have "sufficient for them that are <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> indeed." And <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says to Pope Damasus [Cf. Cf. Can. Clericos, cause. i, qu. 2; Can. Quoniam, cause xvi, qu. 1; Regul. Monach. iv among the supposititious works of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>] that "those who have sufficient income from their parents and their own possessions, if they take what belongs to the poor they commit and incur the guilt of <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a>, and by the abuse of such things they eat and drink judgment to themselves." Now religious if they be able-bodied can support themselves by the work of their hands. Therefore it would seem that they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> if they consume the <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> belonging to the poor.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to live at the expense of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> is the stipend appointed to those who preach the Gospel in payment of their labor or work, according to <a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse10">Matthew 10:10</a>: "The workman is worthy of his meat." Now it belongs not to religious to preach the Gospel, but chiefly to <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> who are pastors and teachers. Therefore religious cannot lawfully live on the <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> of the faithful.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, religious are in the state of perfection. But it is more perfect to give than to receive <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>; for it is written (<a href="../bible/act020.htm#verse35">Acts 20:35</a>): "It is a more blessed thing to give, rather than to receive." Therefore they should not live on <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, but rather should they give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> of their handiwork.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it belongs to religious to avoid obstacles to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and occasions of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now the receiving of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> offers an occasion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and hinders an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; hence a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/2th003.htm#verse9">2 Thessalonians 3:9</a>, "That we might give ourselves a pattern unto you," says: "He who through idleness eats often at another's table, must needs flatter the one who feeds him." It is also written (<a href="../bible/exo023.htm#verse8">Exodus 23:8</a>): "Neither shalt thou take bribes which . . . blind the wise, and pervert the words of the just," and (<a href="../bible/pro022.htm#verse7">Proverbs 22:7</a>): "The borrower is servant to him that lendeth." This is contrary to religion, wherefore a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/2th003.htm#verse9">2 Thessalonians 3:9</a>, "That we might give ourselves a pattern," etc., says, "our religion calls men to liberty." Therefore it would seem that religious should not live on <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, religious especially are bound to imitate the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse15">Philippians 3:15</a>): "Let us . . . as many as are perfect, be thus minded." But the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> was unwilling to live at the expense of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, either in order to cut off the occasion from the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> apostles as he himself says (<a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse12">2 Corinthians 11:12</a>), or to avoid giving <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> to the weak, as appears from <a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 9:12</a>. It would seem therefore that religious ought for the same reasons to refrain from living on <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De oper. Monach. 28): "Cut off the occasion of disgraceful marketing whereby you lower yourselves in the esteem of others, and give <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> to the weak: and show men that you seek not an easy livelihood in idleness, but the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> by the narrow and strait way."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Dial. ii, 1): The Blessed Benedict after leaving his home and parents dwelt for three years in a cave, and while there lived on the food brought to him by a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> from Rome. Nevertheless, although he was able-bodied, we do not read that he sought to live by the labor of his hands. Therefore religious may lawfully live on <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may lawfully live on what is his or due to him. Now that which is given out of liberality becomes the property of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to whom it is given. Wherefore religious and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> whose monasteries or churches have received from the munificence of princes or of any of the faithful any endowment whatsoever for their support, can lawfully live on such endowment without working with their hands, and yet without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> they live on <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. Wherefore in like manner if religious receive movable goods from the faithful they can lawfully live on them. For it is absurd to say that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> may accept an <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> of some great property but not bread or some small sum of money. Nevertheless since these <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> would seem to be bestowed on religious in order that they may have more leisure for religious works, in which the donors of temporal goods wish to have a share, the use of such <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> would become unlawful for them if they abstained from religious works, because in that case, so far as they are concerned, they would be thwarting the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of those who bestowed those <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>.

<p>A thing is due to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in two ways. First, on account of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, which makes all things common, as <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> [<a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a>, Serm. de Temp. lxiv, among the supposititious works of <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>] asserts. Consequently if religious be in need they can lawfully live on <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. Such <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> may occur in three ways. First, through weakness of body, the result being that they are unable to make a living by working with their hands. Secondly, because that which they gain by their handiwork is insufficient for their livelihood: wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De oper. Monach. xvii) that "the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works of the faithful should not leave <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> servants who work with their hands without a supply of necessaries, that when the hour comes for them to nourish their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, so as to make it impossible for them to do these corporal works, they be not oppressed by want." Thirdly, because of the former mode of life of those who were unwont to work with their hands: wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De oper. Monach. xxi) that "if they had in the world the wherewithal easily to support this life without working, and gave it to the needy when they were converted to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we must credit their weakness and bear with it." For those who have thus been delicately brought up are wont to be unable to bear the toil of bodily labor.

<p>In another way a thing becomes due to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> through his affording others something whether temporal or <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, according to (<a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse11">1 Corinthians 9:11</a>), "If we have sown unto you <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, is it a great <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> if we reap your carnal things?" And in this sense religious may live on <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> as being due to them in four ways. First, if they preach by the authority of the prelates. Secondly, if they be ministers of the altar, according to (<a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse13">1 Corinthians 9:13</a>),14, "They that serve the altar partake with the altar. So also the lord ordained that they who preach the Gospel should live by the Gospel." Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De oper. Monach. xxi): "If they be gospelers, I allow, they have" (a claim to live at the charge of the faithful): "if they be ministers of the altar and dispensers of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, they need not insist on it, but it is theirs by perfect right." The reason for this is because the sacrament of the altar wherever it be offered is common to all the faithful. Thirdly, if they devote themselves to the study of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> to the common profit of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (Contra Vigil. xiii): "It is still the custom in Judea, not only among us but also among the Hebrews, for those who meditate on the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the Lord day and night, end have no other share on earth but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, to be supported by the subscriptions of the synagogues and of the whole world." Fourthly, if they have endowed the monastery with the goods they possessed, they may live on the <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> given to the monastery. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De oper. Monach. xxv) that "those who renouncing or distributing their means, whether ample or of any amount whatever, have desired with pious and salutary <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> to be numbered among the poor of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, have a claim on the community and on brotherly love to receive a livelihood in return. They are to be commended indeed if they work with their hands, but if they be unwilling, who will dare to force them? Nor does it matter, as he goes on to say, to which monasteries, or in what place any one of them has bestowed his goods on his needy brethren; for all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> belong to one commonwealth."

<p>On the other hand, in the default of any <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, or of their affording any profit to others, it is unlawful for religious to wish to live in idleness on the <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> given to the poor. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De oper. Monach. xxii): "Sometimes those who enter the profession of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> service come from a servile <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of life, from tilling the soil or working at some trade or lowly occupation. On their case it is not so clear whether they came with the purpose of serving <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or of evading a life of want and toil with a view to being fed and clothed in idleness, and furthermore to being <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> by those by whom they were wont to be despised and downtrodden. Such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> surely cannot excuse themselves from work on the score of bodily weakness, for their former mode of life is evidence against them." And he adds further on (De oper. Monach. xxv): "If they be unwilling to work, neither let them eat. For if the rich <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> themselves to piety, it is not that the poor may be exalted to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>; since it is altogether unseemly that in a life wherein senators become laborers, laborers should become idle, and that where the lords of the manor have come after renouncing their ease, the serfs should live in comfort."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> These authorities must be understood as referring to cases of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, that is to say, when there is no other means of succoring the poor: for then they would be bound not only to refrain from accepting <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, but also to give what they have for the support of the needy.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Prelates are competent to preach in virtue of their office, but religious may be competent to do so in virtue of delegation; and thus when they work in the field of the Lord, they may make their living thereby, according to <a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse6">2 Timothy 2:6</a>, "The husbandman that laboreth must first partake of the fruits," which a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> explains thus, "that is to say, the preacher, who in the field of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> tills the hearts of his hearers with the plough of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> word." Those also who minister to the preachers may live on <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. Hence a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse27">Romans 15:27</a>, "If the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> have been made partakers of their <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, they ought also in carnal things to minister to them," says, "namely, to the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> who sent preachers from Jerusalem." There are moreover other reasons for which a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> has a claim to live at the charge of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Other things being equal, it is more perfect to give than to receive. Nevertheless to give or to give up all one's possessions for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake, and to receive a little for one's livelihood is better than to give to the poor part by part, as stated above (186, 3, ad 6).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> To receive <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> so as to increase one's <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, or to accept a livelihood from another without having a claim to it, and without profit to others or being in need oneself, affords an occasion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But this does not apply to religious, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Whenever there is evident <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> for religious living on <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> without doing any manual work, as well as an evident profit to be derived by others, it is not the weak who are <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a>, but those who are full of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> like the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> our Lord teaches us to despise (<a href="../bible/mat015.htm">Matthew 15:12-14</a>). If, however, these motives of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> and profit be lacking, the weak might possibly be scandalized thereby; and this should be avoided. Yet the same <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> might be occasioned through those who live in idleness on the common revenues.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether it is lawful for religious to beg?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem unlawful for religious to beg. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De oper. Monach. xxviii): "The most cunning foe has scattered on all sides a great number of <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrites</a> wearing the monastic <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, who go wandering about the country," and afterwards he adds: "They all ask, they all demand to be supported in their profitable penury, or to be paid for a pretended <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>." Therefore it would seem that the life of mendicant religious is to be condemned.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/1th004.htm#verse11">1 Thessalonians 4:11</a>): "That you . . . work with your own hands as we commanded you, and that you walk honestly towards them that are without: and that you want nothing of any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a>": and a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on this passage says: "You must work and not be idle, because work is both honorable and a light to the unbeliever: and you must not covet that which belongs to another and much less beg or take anything." Again a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> [<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, (De oper. Monach. iii)] on (<a href="../bible/2th003.htm#verse10">2 Thessalonians 3:10</a>), "If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will not work," etc. says: "He wishes the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to work with the body, so as to gain a livelihood, and not be compelled by want to ask for necessaries." Now this is to beg. Therefore it would seem unlawful to beg while omitting to work with one's hands.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that which is forbidden by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and contrary to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, is unbecoming to religious. Now begging is forbidden in the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">divine law</a>; for it is written (<a href="../bible/deu015.htm#verse4">Deuteronomy 15:4</a>): "There shall be no poor nor beggar among you," and (<a href="../bible/psa036.htm#verse25">Psalm 36:25</a>): "I have not seen the just forsaken, nor his seed seeking bread." Moreover an able-bodied mendicant is punished by <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> (XI, xxvi, de Valid. Mendicant.). Therefore it is unfitting for religious to beg.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, "Shame is about that which is disgraceful," as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 15). Now <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Offic. i, 30) that "to be ashamed to beg is a sign of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> birth." Therefore it is disgraceful to beg: and consequently this is unbecoming to religious.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> command it is especially becoming to preachers of the Gospel to live on <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>). Yet it is not becoming that they should beg, since a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse6">2 Timothy 2:6</a>, "The husbandman, that laboreth," etc. says: "The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> wishes the gospeler to understand that to accept necessaries from those among whom he labors is not mendicancy but a right." Therefore it would seem unbecoming for religious to beg.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It becomes religious to live in imitation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was a mendicant, according to <a href="../bible/psa039.htm#verse18">Psalm 39:18</a>, "But I am a beggar and poor"; where a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> said this of Himself as bearing the 'form of a servant,'" and further on: "A beggar is one who entreats another, and a poor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is one who has not enough for himself." Again it is written (<a href="../bible/psa069.htm#verse6">Psalm 69:6</a>): "I am needy and poor"; where a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "'Needy,' that is a suppliant; 'and poor,' that is, not having enough for myself, because I have no worldly <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>." And <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says in a letter [Reference unknown]: "Beware lest whereas thy Lord," i.e. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, "begged, thou amass other people's <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>." Therefore it becomes religious to beg.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Two things may be considered in reference to mendicancy. The first is on the part of the act itself of begging, which has a certain abasement attaching to it; since of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> those would seem most abased who are not only poor, but are so needy that they have to receive their meat from others. On this way some deserve praise for begging out of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, just as they abase themselves in other ways, as being the most efficacious remedy against <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> which they desire to quench either in themselves or in others by their example. For just as a disease that arises from excessive heat is most efficaciously healed by things that excel in cold, so proneness to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is most efficaciously healed by those things which savor most of abasement. Hence it is said in the Decretals (II, cap. Si quis semel, de Paenitentia): "To condescend to the humblest duties, and to devote oneself to the lowliest service is an exercise of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>; for thus one is able to heal the disease of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>." Hence <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> praises Fabiola (Ep. lxxvii ad ocean.) for that she desired "to receive <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, having poured forth all her <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake." The Blessed Alexis acted in like manner, for, having renounced all his possessions for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake he rejoiced in receiving <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> even from his own servants. It is also related of the Blessed Arsenius in the Lives of the Fathers (v, 6) that he gave thanks because he was forced by <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> to ask for <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. Hence it is enjoined to some people as a penance for grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to go on a pilgrimage begging. Since, however, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> like the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> should not be without discretion, it behooves one to be discreet in becoming a mendicant for the purpose of humiliation, lest a man thereby incur the mark of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> or of anything else unbecoming. Secondly, mendicancy may be considered on the part of that which one gets by begging: and thus a man may be led to beg by a twofold motive. First, by the desire to have <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> or meat without working for it, and such like mendicancy is unlawful; secondly, by a motive of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> or usefulness. The motive is one of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> if a man has no other means of livelihood save begging; and it is a motive of usefulness if he wishes to accomplish something useful, and is unable to do so without the <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> of the faithful. Thus <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> are besought for the building of a bridge, or church, or for any other work whatever that is conducive to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: thus scholars may seek <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> that they may devote themselves to the study of wisdom. On this way mendicancy is lawful to religious no less than to seculars.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is speaking there explicitly of those who beg from motives of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The first <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> speaks of begging from motives of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, as appears from the words of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>; while the second <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> speaks of those who without effecting any useful purpose, beg their livelihood in order to live in idleness. on the other hand, he lives not idly who in any way lives usefully.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This precept of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">divine law</a> does not forbid anyone to beg, but it forbids the rich to be so stingy that some are compelled by <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> to beg. The <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> imposes a penalty on able-bodied mendicants who beg from motives neither of utility nor of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Disgrace is twofold; one arises from lack of honesty [Cf. 145, 1], the other from an external defect, thus it is disgraceful for a man to be sick or poor. Such like uncomeliness of mendicancy does not pertain to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but it may pertain to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Preachers have the right to be fed by those to whom they preach: yet if they wish to seek this by begging so as to receive it as a free <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> and not as a right this will be a mark of greater <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether it is lawful for religious to wear coarser clothes than others?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem unlawful for religious to wear coarser clothes than others. For according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1th005.htm#verse2">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a>)2) we ought to "refrain from all appearance of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." Now coarseness of clothes has an appearance of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse15">Matthew 7:15</a>): "Beware of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> who come to you in the clothing of sheep": and a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/rev006.htm#verse8">Apocalypse 6:8</a>, "Behold a pale horse," says: "The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> finding that he cannot succeed, neither by outward afflictions nor by manifest <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, sends in advance <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> brethren, who under the guise of religion assume the characteristics of the black and red horses by corrupting the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>." Therefore it would seem that religious should not wear coarse clothes.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (Ep. lii ad Nepotian.): "Avoid somber," i.e. black, "equally with glittering apparel. Fine and coarse clothes are equally to be shunned, for the one exhales pleasure, the other vainglory." Therefore, since vainglory is a graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than the use of pleasure, it would seem that religious who should aim at what is more perfect ought to avoid coarse rather than fine clothes.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, religious should aim especially at doing works of penance. Now in works of penance we should use, not outward signs of sorrow, but rather signs of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>; for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse16">Matthew 6:16</a>): "When you fast, be not, as the <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrites</a>, sad," and afterwards He added: "But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thy head and wash thy face." <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> commenting on these words (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 12): "In this chapter we must observe that not only the glare and pomp of outward things, but even the weeds of mourning may be a subject of ostentation, all the more dangerous as being a decoy under the guise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> service." Therefore seemingly religious ought not to wear coarse clothes.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse3">Hebrews 11:3</a>)7): "They wandered about in sheep-skins in goat-skins," and a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> adds--"as Elias and others." Moreover it is said in the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a> XXI, qu. iv, can. Omnis jactantia: "If any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> be found to deride those who wear coarse and religious apparel they must be reproved. For in the early times all those who were <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> went about in common and coarse apparel."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. iii, 12), "in all external things, it is not the use but the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the user that is at fault." On order to judge of this it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to observe that coarse and homely apparel may be considered in two ways. First, as being a sign of a man's disposition or <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, because according to <a href="../bible/sir019.htm#verse27">Sirach 19:27</a>, "the attire . . . of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" shows "what he is." On this way coarseness of attire is sometimes a sign of sorrow: wherefore those who are beset with sorrow are wont to wear coarser clothes, just as on the other hand in times of festivity and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> they wear finer clothes. Hence penitents make use of coarse apparel, for example, the king (<a href="../bible/jon003.htm#verse6">Jonah 3:6</a>) who "was clothed with sack-cloth," and <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a> (<a href="../bible/1ki021.htm#verse27">1 Kings 21:27</a>) who "put <a href="../cathen/07113b.htm">hair-cloth</a> upon his flesh." Sometimes, however, it is a sign of the contempt of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> and worldly ostentation. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (Ep. cxxv ad Rustico Monach.): "Let your somber attire indicate your purity of mind, your coarse robe <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> your contempt of the world, yet so that your mind be not inflated withal, lest your speech belie your <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>." On both these ways it is becoming for religious to wear coarse attire, since religion is a state of penance and of contempt of worldly <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p>But that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> wish to signify this to others arises from three motives. First, in order to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> himself: for just as a man's mind is uplifted by fine clothes, so is it <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a> by lowly apparel. Hence speaking of <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a> who "put <a href="../cathen/07113b.htm">hair-cloth</a> on his flesh," the Lord said to Elias: "Hast thou not seen <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a> <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a> before Me?" (<a href="../bible/1ki021.htm#verse29">1 Kings 21:29</a>). Secondly, in order to set an example to others; wherefore a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse4">Matthew 3:4</a>, "(John) had his garments of camel's hair," says: "He who preaches penance is clothed in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of penance." Thirdly, on account of vainglory; thus <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (cf. Objection 3) that "even the weeds of mourning may be a subject of ostentation."

<p>Accordingly in the first two ways it is praiseworthy to wear <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> apparel, but in the third way it is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>.

<p>Secondly, coarse and homely attire may be considered as the result of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> or negligence, and thus also it is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Coarseness of attire has not of itself the appearance of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, indeed it has more the appearance of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, namely of the contempt of worldly <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Hence it is that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> hide their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> under coarse clothing. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 24) that "the sheep should not dislike their clothing for the reason that the wolves sometimes hide themselves under it."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> is speaking there of the coarse attire that is worn on account of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> teaching men should do no <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> for the sake of show: and this is especially the case when one does something strange. Hence <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> [Hom. xiii in Matth. in the Opus Imperfectum, <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>] says: "While <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> a man should do nothing strange, so as to draw the gaze of others, either by shouting or striking his breast, or casting up his hands," because the very strangeness draws people's attention to him. Yet blame does not attach to all strange behavior that draws people's attention, for it may be done well or ill. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 12) that "in the practice of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> when a man draws attention to himself by unwonted squalor and shabbiness, since he acts thus <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> and not of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, we can gather from his other <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> whether his behavior is motivated by contempt of excessive dress or by affectation." <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">Religious</a>, however, would especially seem not to act thus from affectation, since they wear a coarse <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> as a sign of their profession whereby they profess contempt of the world.
