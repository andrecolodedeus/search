<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether those who are not practiced in keeping the commandments should enter religion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that none should enter religion but those who are practiced in the observance of the commandments. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> gave the counsel of perfection to the young <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who said that he had kept the commandments "from his youth." Now all religious orders originate from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore it would seem that none should be allowed to enter religion but those who are practiced in the observance of the commandments.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xv in Ezech., and Moral. xxii): "No one comes suddenly to the summit; but he must make a beginning of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> life in the smallest matters, so as to accomplish great things." Now the great things are the counsels which pertain to the perfection of life, while the lesser things are the commandments which belong to common righteousness. Therefore it would seem that one ought not to enter religion for the purpose of keeping the counsels, unless one be already practiced in the observance of the precepts.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the religious state, like the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> orders, has a place of eminence in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Now, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> writes to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Siagrius [Regist. ix, Ep. 106], "order should be observed in ascending to orders. For he seeks a fall who aspires to mount to the summit by overpassing the steps." [The rest of the quotation is from Regist. v, Ep. 53, ad Virgil. Episc.]. "For we are well aware that walls when built receive not the weight of the beams until the new fabric is rid of its moisture, lest if they should be burdened with weight before they are seasoned they bring down the whole building" (Dist. xlviii, can. Sicut neophytus). Therefore it would seem that one should not enter religion unless one be practiced in the observance of the precepts.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/psa130.htm#verse2">Psalm 130:2</a>, "As a child that is weaned is towards his mother," says: "First we are conceived in the womb of Mother Church, by being taught the rudiments of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Then we are nourished as it were in her womb, by progressing in those same elements. Afterwards we are brought forth to the light by being regenerated in baptism. Then the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> bears us as it were in her hands and feeds us with milk, when after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> we are instructed in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works and are nourished with the milk of simple doctrine while we progress; until having grown out of infancy we leave our mother's milk for a father's control, that is to say, we pass from simple doctrine, by which we are taught the Word made flesh, to the Word that was in the beginning with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Afterwards it goes on to say: "For those who are just <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> on Holy Saturday are borne in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as it were and fed with milk until Pentecost, during which time nothing arduous is prescribed, no fasts, no rising at midnight. Afterwards they are confirmed by the Paraclete Spirit, and being weaned so to speak, begin to fast and keep other difficult observances. Many, like the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and schismatics, have perverted this order by being weaned before the time. Hence they have come to naught." Now this order is apparently perverted by those who enter religion, or induce others to enter religion, before they are practiced in the easier observance of the commandments. Therefore they would seem to be <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> or schismatics.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, one should proceed from that which precedes to that which follows after. Now the commandments precede the counsels, because they are more universal, for "the implication of the one by the other is not convertible" [Categor. ix], since whoever keeps the counsels keeps the commandments, but the converse does not hold. Seeing then that the right order requires one to pass from that which comes first to that which comes after, it follows that one ought not to pass to the observance of the counsels in religion, without being first of all practiced in the observance of the commandments.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Matthew the publican who was not practiced in the observance of the commandments was called by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> to the observance of the counsels. For it is stated (<a href="../bible/luk005.htm#verse28">Luke 5:28</a>) that "leaving all things he . . . followed Him." Therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to be practiced in the observance of the commandments before passing to the perfection of the counsels.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As shown above (Question 188, Article 1), the religious state is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> schooling for the attainment of the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. This is accomplished through the removal of the obstacles to perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> by religious observances; and these obstacles are those things which attach <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> affections to earthly things. Now the attachment of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> affections to earthly things is not only an obstacle to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, but sometimes leads to the loss of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, when through turning inordinately to temporal goods <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> turns away from the immutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> mortally. Hence it is evident that the observances of the religious state, while removing the obstacles to perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, remove also the occasions of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: for instance, it is clear that <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, watching, obedience, and the like withdraw <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> and all other manner of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p>Consequently it is right that not only those who are practiced in the observance of the commandments should enter religion in order to attain to yet greater perfection, but also those who are not practiced, in order the more easily to avoid <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and attain to perfection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> (Super Matth. xix, 20) says: "The young <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> lies when he says: 'All these have I kept from my youth.' For if he had fulfilled this commandment, 'Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself,' why did he go away sad when he heard: Go, sell all thou hast and give to the poor?" But this means that he lied as to the perfect observance of this commandment. Hence <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> says (Tract. viii super Matth.) that "it is written in the Gospel according to the Hebrews that when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> had said to him: 'Go, sell all thou hast,' the rich <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> began to scratch his head; and that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said to him: How sayest thou: I have fulfilled the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, seeing that it is written in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself? Behold many of thy brethren, children of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, are clothed in filth, and die of hunger, whilst thy house is full of all manner of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, and nothing whatever hath passed thence to them. And thus <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> reproves him saying: If thou wilt be perfect, go, etc. For it is impossible to fulfil the commandment which says, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, and to be rich, especially to have such great <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>." This also refers to the perfect fulfilment of this precept. on the other hand, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that he kept the commandments imperfectly and in a general way. For perfection consists chiefly in the observance of the precepts of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as stated above (Question 184, Article 3). Wherefore in order to show that the perfection of the counsels is useful both to the innocent and to sinners, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> called not only the innocent youth but also the sinner Matthew. Yet Matthew obeyed His call, and the youth obeyed not, because sinners are converted to the religious life more easily than those who presume on their innocency. It is to the former that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> says (<a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse31">Matthew 21:31</a>): "The publicans and the harlots shall go into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> before you."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The highest and the lowest place can be taken in three ways. First, in reference to the same state and the same <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; and thus it is evident that no one comes to the summit suddenly, since every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that lives aright, progresses during the whole course of his life, so as to arrive at the summit. Secondly, in comparison with various states; and thus he who desires to reach to a higher state need not begin from a lower state: for instance, if a man wish to be a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> he need not first of all be practiced in the life of a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>. Thirdly, in comparison with different <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; and in this way it is clear that one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> begins straightway not only from a higher state, but even from a higher degree of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, than the highest degree to which another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> attains throughout his whole life. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Dial. ii, 1): "All are agreed that the boy Benedict began at a high degree of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and perfection in his daily life."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (Question 184, Article 6) the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> orders prerequire <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, whereas the religious state is a school for the attainment of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. Hence the burden of orders should be laid on the walls when these are already seasoned with <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, whereas the burden of religion seasons the walls, i.e. men, by drawing out the damp of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> It is manifest from the words of this <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> that it is chiefly a question of the order of doctrine, in so far as one has to pass from easy <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to that which is more difficult. Hence it is clear from what follows that the statement that certain "<a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>" and "schismatics have perverted this order" refers to the order of doctrine. For it continues thus: "But he says that he has kept these things, namely the aforesaid order, binding himself by an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> [Referring to the last words of the verse, and taking 'retributio,' which <a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a> renders 'reward,' as meaning 'punishment']. Thus I was <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> not only in other things but also in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, for 'I was humbly minded'; because I was first of all fed with milk, which is the Word made flesh, so that I grew up to partake of the bread of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, namely the Word that is in the beginning with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." The example which is given in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, of the newly <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> not being commanded to fast until Pentecost, shows that no difficult things are to be laid on them as an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> before the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> inspires them inwardly to take upon themselves difficult things of their own choice. Hence after Pentecost and the receiving of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> observes a fast. Now the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> (Super Luc. 1:15), "is not confined to any particular age; He ceases not when men die, He is not excluded from the maternal womb." <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> also in a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> for Pentecost (xxx in Ev.) says: "He fills the boy harpist and makes him a psalmist: He fills the boy abstainer and makes him a wise judge [<a href="../bible/dan001.htm#verse8">Daniel 1:8-17</a>]," and afterwards he adds: "No time is needed to learn whatsoever He will, for He teaches the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> by the merest touch." Again it is written (<a href="../bible/ecc008.htm#verse8">Ecclesiastes 8:8</a>), "It is not in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> power to stop the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>," and the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> admonishes us (<a href="../bible/1th005.htm#verse19">1 Thessalonians 5:19</a>): "Extinguish not the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>," and (<a href="../bible/act007.htm#verse51">Acts 7:51</a>) it is said against certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>: "You always resist the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> There are certain chief precepts which are the ends, so to say, of the commandments and counsels. These are the precepts of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and the counsels are directed to them, not that these precepts cannot be observed without keeping the counsels, but that the keeping of the counsels conduces to the better observance of the precepts. The other precepts are secondary and are directed to the precepts of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; in such a way that unless one observe them it is altogether impossible to keep the precepts of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Accordingly in the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> the perfect observance of the precepts of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> precedes the counsels, and yet sometimes it follows them in point of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. For such is the order of the end in relation to things directed to the end. But the observance in a general way of the precepts of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> together with the other precepts, is compared to the counsels as the common to the proper, because one can observe the precepts without observing the counsels, but not vice versa. Hence the common observance of the precepts precedes the counsels in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; but it does not follow that it precedes them in point of time, for a thing is not in the genus before being in one of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But the observance of the precepts apart from the counsels is directed to the observance of the precepts together with the counsels; as an imperfect to a perfect <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, even as the irrational to the rational animal. Now the perfect is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> prior to the imperfect, since "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>," as <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Consol. iii, 10), "begins with perfect things." And yet it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the precepts first of all to be observed without the counsels, and afterwards with the counsels, just as it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for one to be an ass before being a man, or <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> before being a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. On like manner it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> first of all to keep the commandments in the world before entering religion; especially as the worldly life does not dispose one to religious perfection, but is more an obstacle thereto.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether one ought to be bound by vow to enter religion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one ought not to be bound by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to enter religion. For in making his profession a man is bound by the <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious vow</a>. Now before profession a year of probation is allowed, according to the rule of the Blessed Benedict (lviii) and according to the decree of <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> [Sext. Decret., cap. Non solum., de Regular. et Transeunt, ad Relig.] who moreover forbade anyone to be bound to the religious life by profession before completing the year of probation. Therefore it would seem that much less ought anyone while yet in the world to be bound by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to enter religion.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Regist. xi, Ep. 15): <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> "should be persuaded to be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>, not by compulsion but of their own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>" (Dist. xlv, can. De Judaeis). Now one is compelled to fulfil what one has vowed. Therefore no one should be bound by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to enter religion.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no one should give another an occasion of falling; wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/exo021.htm#verse33">Exodus 21:33-34</a>): "If a man open a pit . . . and an ox or an ass fall into it, the owner of the pit shall pay the price of the beasts." Now through being bound by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to enter religion it often happens that people fall into <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> and various <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore it would seem that one ought not to be bound by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to enter religion.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written, (<a href="../bible/psa075.htm#verse12">Psalm 75:12</a>): "Vow ye, and pay to the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>"; and a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says that "some <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> concern the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, such as <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, and the like." Consequently <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Scripture</a> invites us to <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> these things. But <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Scripture</a> invites us only to that which is better. Therefore it is better to bind oneself by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to enter religion.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 88, Article 6), when we were treating of <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, one and the same work done in fulfilment of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is more praiseworthy than if it be done apart from a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, both because to <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is an act of religion, which has a certain pre-eminence among the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and because a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> strengthens a man's will to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and just as a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is more grievous through proceeding from a will obstinate in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, so a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work is the more praiseworthy through proceeding from a will confirmed in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by means of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. Therefore it is in itself praiseworthy to bind oneself by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to enter religion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious vow</a> is twofold. One is the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> which makes a man a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> or a brother in some other religious order. This is called the profession, and such a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> should be preceded by a year's probation, as the objection proves. The other is the simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> which does not make a man a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> or a religious, but only binds him to enter religion, and such a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> need not be preceded by a year's probation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The words quoted from <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> must be understood as referring to absolute <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. But the compulsion arising from the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is not absolute <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, but a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of end, because after such a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> one cannot attain to the end of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> unless one fulfil that <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. Such a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> is not to be avoided; indeed, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. cxxvii ad Armentar. et Paulin.), "<a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> is the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> that compels us to better things."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to enter religion is a strengthening of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> for better things, and consequently, considered in itself, instead of giving a man an occasion of falling, withdraws him from it. But if one who breaks a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> falls more grievously, this does not derogate from the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, as neither does it derogate from the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> that some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> more grievously after being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether one who is bound by a vow to enter religion is under an obligation of entering religion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one who is bound by the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to enter religion is not under an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of entering religion. For it is said in the Decretals (XVII, qu. ii, can. Consaldus): "Consaldus, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> under pressure of sickness and emotional fervour, promised to become a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. He did not, however, bind himself to a monastery or abbot; nor did he commit his promise to writing, but he renounced his benefice in the hands of a notary; and when he was restored to health he refused to become a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>." And afterwards it is added: "We adjudge and by apostolic authority we command that the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> be admitted to his benefice and sacred duties, and that he be allowed to retain them in peace." Now this would not be if he were bound to enter religion. Therefore it would seem that one is not bound to keep one's <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of entering religion.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no one is bound to do what is not in his power. Now it is not in a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> power to enter religion, since this depends on the consent of those whom he wishes to join. Therefore it would seem that a man is not <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to fulfil the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> by which he bound himself to enter religion.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a less useful <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> cannot remit a more useful one. Now the fulfilment of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to enter religion might hinder the fulfilment of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to take up the cross in defense of the Holy Land; and the latter apparently is the more useful <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, since thereby a man obtains the forgiveness of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore it would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> by which a man has bound himself to enter religion is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> to be fulfilled.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/ecc005.htm#verse3">Ecclesiastes 5:3</a>): "If thou hast vowed anything to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, defer not to pay it, for an unfaithful and foolish promise displeaseth him"; and a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/psa075.htm#verse12">Psalm 75:12</a>, "Vow ye, and pay to the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," says: "To <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> depends on the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: but after the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> has been taken the fulfilment is of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 88, Article 1), when we were treating of <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is a promise made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in matters concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says in a letter to Boniface [Innoc. I, Epist. ii, Victricio Epo. Rotomag., cap. 14; Cf. can. Viduas: <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. xxvii, qu. 1: "If among men of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> contracts are wont to be absolutely irrevocable, how much more shall the breaking of this promise given to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be deserving of punishment!" Therefore a man is under an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to fulfil what he has vowed, provided this be something pertaining to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>Now it is evident that entrance into religion pertains very much to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since thereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> devotes himself entirely to the divine service, as stated above (Question 186, Article 1). Hence it follows that he who binds himself to enter religion is under an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to enter religion according as he intends to bind himself by his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>: so that if he intend to bind himself absolutely, he is <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to enter as soon as he can, through the cessation of a lawful impediment; whereas if he intend to bind himself to a certain fixed time, or under a certain fixed <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, he is bound to enter religion when the time comes or the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> is fulfilled.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> had made, not a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a>, but a simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. Hence he was not a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> in effect, so as to be bound by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to dwell in a monastery and renounce his cure. However, in the court of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> one ought to advise him to renounce all and enter religion. Hence (Extra, De Voto et Voti Redemptione, cap. Per tuas) the Bishop of Grenoble, who had accepted the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopate</a> after vowing to enter religion, without having fulfilled his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, is counseled that if "he wish to heal his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> he should renounce the government of his see and pay his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> to the Most High."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above (88, 3, ad 2), when we were treating of <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, he who has bound himself by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to enter a certain religious order is bound to do what is in his power in order to be received in that order; and if he intend to bind himself simply to enter the religious life, if he be not admitted to one, he is bound to go to another; whereas if he intend to bind himself only to one particular order, he is bound only according to the measure of the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to which he has engaged himself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to enter religion being perpetual is greater than the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of pilgrimage to the Holy Land, which is a temporal <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>; and as <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> says (Extra, De Voto et Voti Redemptione, cap. Scripturae), "he who exchanges a temporary service for the perpetual service of religion is in no way guilty of breaking his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>."

<p>Moreover it may be reasonably stated that also by entrance into religion a man obtains remission of all his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For if by giving <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> a man may forthwith satisfy for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, according to (<a href="../bible/dan004.htm#verse24">Daniel 4:24</a>), "Redeem thou thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> with <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>," much more does it suffice to satisfy for all his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that a man devote himself wholly to the divine service by entering religion, for this surpasses all manner of satisfaction, even that of public penance, according to the Decretals (XXXIII, qu. i, cap. Admonere) just as a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a> exceeds a sacrifice, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> declares (Hom. xx in Ezech.). Hence we read in the Lives of the Fathers (vi, 1) that by entering religion one receives the same <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> as by being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. And yet even if one were not thereby <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> from all debt of punishment, nevertheless the entrance into religion is more profitable than a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, as regards the advancement in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is preferable to <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> from punishment.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether he who has vowed to enter religion is bound to remain in religion in perpetuity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that he who has vowed to enter religion, is bound in perpetuity to remain in religion. For it is better not to enter religion than to leave after entering, according to (<a href="../bible/2pe002.htm#verse21">2 Peter 2:21</a>), "It had been better for them not to have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the way of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, than after they have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> it to turn back," and (<a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse62">Luke 9:62</a>), "No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> putting his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>." But he who bound himself by the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to enter religion, is under the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to enter, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). Therefore he is also bound to remain for always.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, everyone is bound to avoid that which gives rise to <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, and is a bad example to others. Now by leaving after entering religion a man gives a bad example and is an occasion of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> to others, who are thereby withdrawn from entering or incited to leave. Therefore it seems that he who enters religion in order to fulfil a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> which he had previously taken, is bound to remain evermore.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to enter religion is accounted a perpetual <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>: wherefore it is preferred to temporal <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, as stated above (3, ad 3; 88, 12, ad 1). But this would not be so if a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> after vowing to enter religion were to enter with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of leaving. It seems, therefore, that he who <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> to enter religion is bound also to remain in perpetuity.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a>, for the reason that it binds a man to remain in religion for evermore, has to be preceded by a year of probation; whereas this is not required before the simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> whereby a man binds himself to enter religion. Therefore it seems that he who <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> to enter religion is not for that reason bound to remain there in perpetuity.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: because "to <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>" according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [Gloss of <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a> on <a href="../bible/psa075.htm#verse12">Psalm 75:12</a>. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> extends as far as the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who takes the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. Accordingly if in vowing he intend to bind himself not only to enter religion, but also to remain there evermore, he is bound to remain in perpetuity. If, on the other hand, he intend to bind himself to enter religion for the purpose of trial, while retaining the freedom to remain or not remain, it is clear that he is not bound to remain. If, however, in vowing he thought merely of entering religion, without thinking of being free to leave, or of remaining in perpetuity, it would seem that he is bound to enter religion according to the form prescribed by common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, which is that those who enter should be given a year's probation. Wherefore he is not bound to remain for ever.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is better to enter religion with the purpose of making a trial than not to enter at all, because by so doing one disposes oneself to remain always. Nor is a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> accounted to turn or to look back, save when he omits to do that which he engaged to do: else whoever does a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work for a time, would be unfit for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, unless he did it always, which is evidently <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who has entered religion gives neither <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> nor bad example by leaving, especially if he do so for a reasonable motive; and if others are <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a>, it will be passive <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> on their part, and not active <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> on the part of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> leaving, since in doing so, he has done what was lawful, and expedient on account of some reasonable motive, such as sickness, weakness, and the like.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> He who enters with the purpose of leaving forthwith, does not seem to fulfil his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, since this was not his <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> in vowing. Hence he must change that purpose, at least so as to wish to try whether it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for him to remain in religion, but he is not bound to remain for evermore.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether children should be received in religion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that children ought not to be received in religion. Because it is said (Extra, De Regular. et Transeunt. ad Relig., cap. Nullus): "No one should be tonsured unless he be of legal age and willing." But children, seemingly, are not of legal age; nor have they a will of their own, not having perfect use of reason. Therefore it seems that they ought not to be received in religion.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the state of religion would seem to be a state of repentance; wherefore religion is derived [Cf. 81, 1 from "religare" [to bind] or from "re-eligere" [to choose again], as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei x, 3 [Cf. De Vera Relig. lv]). But repentance does not become children. Therefore it seems that they should not enter religion.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is like that of an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. But children under the age of fourteen ought not to be bound by <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> (Decret. XXII, qu. v, cap. Pueri and cap. Honestum.). Therefore it would seem that neither should they be bound by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it is seemingly unlawful to bind a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> that can be <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> canceled. Now if any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of unripe age bind themselves to religion, they can be withdrawn by their parents or guardians. For it is written in the Decretals (XX, qu. ii, can. Puella) that "if a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">maid</a> under twelve years of age shall take the sacred veil of her own accord, her parents or guardians, if they choose, can at once declare the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> null and void." It is therefore unlawful for children, especially of unripe age, to be admitted or bound to religion.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse14">Matthew 19:14</a>): "Suffer the little children, and forbid them not to come to Me." Expounding these words <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> says (Tract. vii in Matth.) that "the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> before they have been taught the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of righteousness [Cf. <a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse16">Matthew 19:16-30</a>, rebuke those who offer children and babes to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: but <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> urges His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to stoop to the service of children. We must therefore take note of this, lest deeming ourselves to excel in wisdom we despise the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> little ones, as though we were great, and forbid the children to come to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (2, ad 1), the <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious vow</a> is twofold. One is the simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> consisting in a mere promise made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and proceeding from the interior deliberation of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. Such a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> derives its efficacy from the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">divine law</a>. Nevertheless it may encounter a twofold obstacle. First, through lack of deliberation, as in the case of the insane, whose <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> are not binding [Extra, De Regular. et Transeunt. ad Relig., cap. Sicut tenor]. The same applies to children who have not reached the required use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, so as to be capable of guile, which use boys attain, as a rule, at about the age of fourteen, and girls at the age of twelve, this being what is called "the age of puberty," although in some it comes earlier and in others it is delayed, according to the various dispositions of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Secondly, the efficacy of a simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> encounters an obstacle, if the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who makes a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not his own master; for instance, if a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a>, though having the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> to enter religion, or even is ordained, without the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of his master: for his master can annul this, as stated in the Decretals (Dist. LIV, cap. Si servus). And since boys and girls under the age of puberty are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> in their father's power as regards the disposal of their manner of life, their father may either cancel or approve their <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, if it please him to do so, as it is expressly said with regard to a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> (<a href="../bible/num030.htm#verse4">Numbers 30:4</a>).

<p>Accordingly if before reaching the age of puberty a child makes a simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, not yet having full use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, he is not bound in virtue of the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>; but if he has the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> before reaching the age of puberty, he is bound, so far as he is concerned, by his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>; yet this <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> may be removed by his father's authority, under whose control he still remains, because the ordinance of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> whereby one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is subject to another considers what happens in the majority of cases. If, however, the child has passed the age of puberty, his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> cannot be annulled by the authority of his parents; though if he has not the full use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, he would not be bound in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>The other is the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> which makes a man a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> or a religious. Such a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is subject to the ordinance of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, on account of the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> attached to it. And since the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> considers what happens in the majority of cases, a profession made before the age of puberty, however much the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who makes profession may have the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, or be capable of guile, does not take effect so as to make him a religious (Extra, De Regular., etc. cap. Significatum est.).

<p>Nevertheless, although they cannot be professed before the age of puberty, they can, with the consent of their parents, be received into religion to be educated there: thus it is related of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a> (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse80">Luke 1:80</a>) that "the child grew and was strengthened in spirit, and was in the deserts." Hence, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> states (Dial. ii, 3), "the Roman nobles began to give their sons to the blessed Benedict to be nurtured for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a>"; and this is most fitting, according to <a href="../bible/lam003.htm#verse27">Lamentations 3:27</a>, "It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for a man when he has borne the yoke from his youth." It is for this reason that by common custom children are made to apply themselves to those duties or arts with which they are to pass their lives.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The legal age for receiving the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> and taking the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of religion is the age of puberty, when a man is able to make use of his own will; but before the age of puberty it is possible to have reached the lawful age to receive the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> and be educated in a religious house.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The religious state is chiefly directed to the attachment of perfection, as stated above (186, 1, ad 4); and accordingly it is becoming to children, who are easily drawn to it. But as a consequence it is called a state of repentance, inasmuch as occasions of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are removed by religious observances, as stated above (186, 1, ad 4).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Even as children are not bound to take oaths (as the canon states), so are they not bound to take <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. If, however, they bind themselves by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> or <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to do something, they are bound in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sight, if they have the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, but they are not bound in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> before reaching the age of fourteen.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who has not reached the age of puberty is not rebuked (<a href="../bible/num030.htm#verse4">Numbers 30:4</a>) for taking a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> without her parents' consent: but the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> can be made void by her parents. Hence it is evident that she does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in vowing. But we are given to understand that she binds herself by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, so far as she may, without prejudice to her parents' authority.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether one ought to be withdrawn from entering religion through deference to one's parents?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one ought to be withdrawn from entering religion through deference to one's parents. For it is not lawful to omit that which is of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> in order to do that which is optional. Now deference to one's parents comes under an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of the precept concerning the honoring of our parents (<a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse12">Exodus 20:12</a>); wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse4">1 Timothy 5:4</a>): "If any <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> have children or grandchildren, let her learn first to govern her own house, and to make a return of <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to her parents." But the entrance to religion is optional. Therefore it would seem that one ought not to omit deference to one's parents for the sake of entering religion.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, seemingly the subjection of a son to his father is greater than that of a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> to his master, since sonship is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, while slavery results from the curse of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as appears from <a href="../bible/gen009.htm#verse25">Genesis 9:25</a>. Now a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> cannot set aside the service of his master in order to enter religion or take <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> orders, as stated in the Decretals (Dist. LIV, cap. Si servus). Much less therefore can a son set aside the deference due to his father in order to enter religion.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a man is more indebted to his parents than to those to whom he owes money. Now <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who owe money to anyone cannot enter religion. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Regist. viii, Ep. 5) that "those who are engaged in trade must by no means be admitted into a monastery, when they seek admittance, unless first of all they withdraw from public business" (Dist. liii, can. Legem.). Therefore seemingly much less may children enter religion in despite of their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to their parents.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is related (<a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse22">Matthew 4:22</a>) that James and John "left their nets and father, and followed <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>." By this, says <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> (Can. iii in Matth.), "we learn that we who intend to follow <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> are not bound by the cares of the secular life, and by the ties of home."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (101, 2, ad 2) when we were treating of piety, parents as such have the character of a principle, wherefore it is competent to them as such to have the care of their children. Hence it is unlawful for a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> having children to enter religion so as altogether to set aside the care for their children, namely without providing for their <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse8">1 Timothy 5:8</a>) that "if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> have not care of his own . . . he hath denied the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and is worse than an infidel."

<p>Nevertheless it is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> competent to parents to be assisted by their children, in so far, to wit, as they are placed in a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. Consequently we must say that when their parents are in such need that they cannot fittingly be supported otherwise than by the help of their children, these latter may not lawfully enter religion in despite of their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to their parents. If, however, the parents' <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> be not such as to stand in great need of their children's assistance, the latter may, in despite of the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> they owe their parents, enter religion even against their parents' command, because after the age of puberty every freeman enjoys freedom in things concerning the ordering of his state of life, especially in such as belong to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and "we should more obey the Father of spirits that we may live ['Shall we not much more obey the Father of Spirits, and live?']," as says the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse9">Hebrews 12:9</a>), than obey our parents. Hence as we read (<a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse22">Matthew 8:22</a>; <a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse62">Luke 9:62</a>) <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> rebuked the disciple who was unwilling to follow him forthwith on account of his father's burial: for there were others who could see to this, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> remarks [Hom. xxvii in Matth.].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The commandment of honoring our parents extends not only to bodily but also to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> service, and to the paying of deference. Hence even those who are in religion can fulfil the commandment of honoring their parents, by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for them and by revering and assisting them, as becomes religious, since even those who live in the world <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> their parents in different ways as befits their <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Since slavery was imposed in punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it follows that by slavery <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> forfeits something which otherwise he would be competent to have, namely the free disposal of his <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, for "a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> belongs wholly to his master" [<a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, Polit. i, 2. On the other hand, the son, through being subject to his father, is not hindered from freely disposing of his <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> by transferring himself to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; which is most conducive to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> He who is under a certain fixed <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> cannot lawfully set it aside so long as he is able to fulfil it. Wherefore if a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is under an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to give an account to someone or to pay a certain fixed debt, he cannot lawfully evade this <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> in order to enter religion. If, however, he owes a sum of money, and has not wherewithal to pay the debt, he must do what he can, namely by surrendering his goods to his creditor. According to <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> [Cod. IV, x, de Oblig. et Action, 12 money lays an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> not on the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of a freeman, but on his property, because the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of a freeman "is above all pecuniary consideration" [Dig. L, xvii, de div. reg. Jur. ant. 106,176]. Hence, after surrendering his property, he may lawfully enter religion, nor is he bound to remain in the world in order to earn the means of paying the debt.

<p>On the other hand, he does not owe his father a special debt, except as may arise in a case of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, as stated above.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether parish priests may lawfully enter religion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> cannot lawfully enter religion. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Past. iii, 4) that "he who undertakes the cure of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, receives an awful warning in the words: 'My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, thou hast engaged fast thy hand to a stranger'" (<a href="../bible/pro006.htm#verse1">Proverbs 6:1</a>); and he goes on to say, "because to be surety for a friend is to take charge of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of another on the surety of one's own behavior." Now he who is under an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to a man for a debt, cannot enter religion, unless he pay what he owes, if he can. Since then a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is able to fulfil the cure of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, to which <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> he has pledged his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, it would seem unlawful for him to lay aside the cure of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in order to enter religion.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, what is lawful to one is likewise lawful to all. But if all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> having cure of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> were to enter religion, the people would be left without a pastor's care, which would be unfitting. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> cannot lawfully enter religion.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, chief among the acts to which religious orders are directed are those whereby a man gives to others the fruit of his <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>. Now such acts are competent to <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacons</a>, whom it becomes by virtue of their office to preach and hear confessions. Therefore it would seem unlawful for a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> to pass over to religion.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said in the Decretals (XIX, qu. ii, cap. Duce sunt leges.): "If a man, while governing the people in his church under the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and leading a secular life, is inspired by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> to desire to work out his <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in a monastery or under some canonical rule, even though his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> withstand him, we authorize him to go freely."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (3, ad 3; 88, 12, ad 1), the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of a perpetual <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> stands before every other <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>. Now it belongs properly to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and religious to be bound by perpetual <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to devote themselves to the divine service [Cf. 184, 5], while <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacons</a> are not, as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are, bound by a perpetual and <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to retain the cure of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> "cannot lay aside their bishopric for any pretext whatever, without the authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a>" (Extra, De Regular. et Transeunt. ad Relig., cap. Licet.): whereas <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacons</a> and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are free to renounce in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> the cure entrusted to them, without the Pope's special permission, who alone can dispense from perpetual <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. Therefore it is evident that <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacons</a> and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> may lawfully enter religion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Parish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacons</a> have bound themselves to the care of their subjects, as long as they retain their archdeaconry or <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, but they did not bind themselves to retain their archdeaconry or <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> for ever.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (Contra Vigil.): "Although they," namely religious, "are sorely smitten by thy poisonous tongue, about whom you argue, saying; 'If all shut themselves up and live in solitude, who will go to church? who will convert worldlings? who will be able to urge sinners to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>?' If this holds <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, if all are fools with thee, who can be wise? Nor will <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> be commendable, for if all be <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, and none marry, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> will perish. Virtue is rare, and is not desired by many." It is therefore evident that this is a foolish alarm; thus might a man fear to draw water lest the river run dry. [<a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> gives no reply to the third objection, which is sufficiently solved in the body of the article.]

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether it is lawful to pass from one religious order to another?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems unlawful to pass from one religious order to another, even a stricter one. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse25">Hebrews 10:25</a>): "Not forsaking our assembly, as some are accustomed"; and a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> observes: "Those namely who yield through fear of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, or who presuming on themselves withdraw from the company of sinners or of the imperfect, that they may appear to be righteous." Now those who pass from one religious order to another more perfect one would seem to do this. Therefore this is seemingly unlawful.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the profession of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> is stricter than that of canons regular (Extra, De Statu Monach. et Canonic. Reg., cap. Quod Dei timorem). But it is unlawful for anyone to pass from the state of canon regular to the monastic state. For it is said in the Decretals (XIX, qu. iii, can. Mandamus): "We ordain and without any exception forbid any professed canon regular to become a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, unless (which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid) he have fallen into public <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." Therefore it would seem unlawful for anyone to pass from one religious order to another of higher rank.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is bound to fulfil what he has vowed, as long as he is able lawfully to do so; thus if a man has vowed to observe <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, he is bound, even after contracting marriage by words in the present tense, to fulfil his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> so long as the marriage is not consummated, because he can fulfil the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> by entering religion. Therefore if a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> may lawfully pass from one religious order to another, he will be bound to do so if he vowed it previously while in the world. But this would seem objectionable, since in many cases it might give rise to <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>. Therefore a religious may not pass from one religious order to another stricter one.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said in the Decretals (XX, qu. iv, can. Virgines): "If sacred <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> design for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to pass to another monastery on account of a stricter life, and decide to remain there, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod allows them to do so": and the same would seem to apply to any religious. Therefore one may lawfully pass from one religious order to another.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is not commendable to pass from one religious order to another: both because this frequently gives <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> to those who remain; and because, other things being equal, it is easier to make progress in a religious order to which one is accustomed than in one to which one is not habituated. Hence in the Conferences of the Fathers (Coll. xiv, 5) Abbot Nesteros says: "It is best for each one that he should, according to the resolve he has made, hasten with the greatest zeal and care to reach the perfection of the work he has undertaken, and nowise forsake the profession he has chosen." And further on he adds (cap. 6) by way of reason: "For it is impossible that one and the same <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should excel in all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> at once, since if he endeavor to practice them equally, he will of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, while trying to attain them all, end in acquiring none of them perfectly": because the various religious orders excel in respect of various works of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p>Nevertheless one may commendably pass from one religious order to another for three reasons. First, through zeal for a more perfect religious life, which excellence depends, as stated above (Question 188, Article 6), not merely on severity, but chiefly on the end to which a religious order is directed, and secondarily on the discretion whereby the observances are proportionate to the due end. Secondly, on account of a religious order falling away from the perfection it ought to have: for instance, if in a more severe religious order, the religious begin to live less strictly, it is commendable for one to pass even to a less severe religious order if the observance is better. Hence in the Conferences of the Fathers (Coll. xix, 3,5,6) Abbot John says of himself that he had passed from the solitary life, in which he was professed, to a less severe life, namely of those who lived in community, because the hermetical life had fallen into decline and laxity. Thirdly, on account of sickness or weakness, the result of which sometimes is that one is unable to keep the ordinances of a more severe religious order, though able to observe those of a less strict religion.

<p>There is, however, a difference in these three cases. For in the first case one ought, on account of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, to seek permission: yet this cannot be denied, provided it be certain that this other religion is more severe. "And if there be a probable <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about this, one should ask one's superior to decide" (Extra, De Regular. et Transeunt. ad Relig., cap. Licet.). On like manner the superior's decision should be sought in the second case. On the third case it is also <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to have a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Those who pass to a stricter religious order, do so not out of presumption that they may appear righteous, but out of devotion, that they may become more righteous.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Religious orders whether of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> or of canons regular are destined to the works of the contemplative life. Chief among these are those which are performed in the divine mysteries, and these are the direct object of the orders of canons regular, the members of which are <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> religious <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>. On the other hand, monastic religious are not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, according to the Decretals (XVI, qu. i, cap. Alia causa). Hence although monastic orders are more severe, it would be lawful, supposing the members to be lay monks, to pass from the monastic order to an order of canons regular, according to the statement of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> (Ep. cxxv, ad Rustic. Monach.): "So live in the monastery as to deserve to become a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>"; but not conversely, as expressed in the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a> quoted (XIX, qu. iii). If, however, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> be <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> devoting themselves to the sacred ministry, they have this in common with canons regular coupled with greater severity, and consequently it will be lawful to pass from an order of canons regular to a monastic order, provided withal that one seek the superior's permission (XIX, qu. iii; cap. Statuimus).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> whereby a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is bound to a less strict order, is more binding than the simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> whereby a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is bound to a stricter order. For if after taking a simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> were to be <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a>, his marriage would not be invalid, as it would be after his taking a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. Consequently a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who is professed in a less severe order is not bound to fulfil a simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> he has taken on entering a more severe order.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether one ought to induce others to enter religion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that no one ought to induce others to enter religion. For the blessed Benedict prescribes in his Rule (lviii) that "those who seek to enter religion must not easily be admitted, but spirits must be tested whether they be of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>"; and Cassian has the same instruction (De Inst. Caenob. iv, 3). Much less therefore is it lawful to induce anyone to enter religion.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse15">Matthew 23:15</a>): "Woe to you . . . because you go round about the sea and the land to make one proselyte, and when he is made you make him the child of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> twofold more than yourselves." Now thus would seem to do those who induce <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to enter religion. Therefore this would seem blameworthy.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no one should induce another to do what is to his prejudice. But those who are induced to enter religion, sometimes take harm therefrom, for sometimes they are under <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to enter a stricter religion. Therefore it would not seem praiseworthy to induce others to enter religion.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/exo026.htm#verse3">Exodus 26:3, seqq.</a> [<a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> quotes the sense, not the words]): "Let one curtain draw the other." Therefore one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should draw another to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> service.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Those who induce others to enter religion not only do not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> a great reward. For it is written (<a href="../bible/jam005.htm#verse20">James 5:20</a>): "He who causeth a sinner to be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> from the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of his way, shall save his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from death, and shall cover a multitude of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>"; and (<a href="../bible/dan012.htm#verse3">Daniel 12:3</a>): "They that instruct many to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> shall be as stars for all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>."

<p>Nevertheless such inducement may be affected by a threefold inordinateness. First, if one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> force another by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to enter religion: and this is forbidden in the Decretals (XX, qu. iii, cap. Praesens). Secondly, if one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> persuade another simoniacally to enter religion, by giving him presents: and this is forbidden in the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a> (I, qu. ii, cap. Quam pio). But this does not apply to the case where one provides a poor <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> with necessaries by educating him in the world for the religious life; or when without any compact one gives a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> little presents for the sake of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> fellowship. Thirdly, if one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> entices another by lies: for it is to be feared that the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> thus enticed may turn back on finding himself deceived, and thus "the last state of that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" may become "worse than the first" (<a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse26">Luke 11:26</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Those who are induced to enter religion have still a time of probation wherein they make a trial of the hardships of religion, so that they are not easily admitted to the religious life.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> (Can. xxiv in Matth.) this saying of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> was a forecast of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> endeavors of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, after the preaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, to draw <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> or even <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to observe the Jewish ritual, thereby making them doubly children of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, because, to wit, they were not forgiven the former <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which they committed while adherents of Judaism, and furthermore they incurred the guilt of Jewish perfidy; and thus interpreted these words have nothing to do with the case in point.

<p>According to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, however, in his commentary on this passage of Matthew, the reference is to the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> even at the time when it was yet lawful to keep the legal observances, in so far as he whom they converted to Judaism "from paganism, was merely misled; but when he saw the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of his teachers, he returned to his vomit, and becoming a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> deserved greater punishment for his treachery." Hence it is manifest that it is not blameworthy to draw others to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or to the religious life, but only when one gives a bad example to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>, whence he becomes worse.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The lesser is included in the greater. Wherefore a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who is bound by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> or <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to enter a lesser order, may be lawfully induced to enter a greater one. unless there be some special obstacle, such as ill-health, or the hope of making greater progress in the lesser order. On the other hand, one who is bound by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> or <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to enter a greater order, cannot be lawfully induced to enter a lesser order, except for some special and evident motive, and then with the superior's dispensation.

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether it is praiseworthy to enter religion without taking counsel of many, and previously deliberating for a long time?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would not seem praiseworthy to enter religion without taking counsel of many, and previously deliberating for a long time. For it is written (<a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse1">1 John 4:1</a>): "Believe not every spirit, but try the spirits if they be of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Now sometimes a man's purpose of entering religion is not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since it often comes to naught through his leaving the religious life; for it is written (<a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse38">Acts 5:38-39</a>): "If this counsel or this work be of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you cannot overthrow it." Therefore it would seem that one ought to make a searching inquiry before entering religion.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/pro025.htm#verse9">Proverbs 25:9</a>): "Treat thy <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> with thy friend." Now a man's <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> would seem to be especially one that concerns a change in his state of life. Therefore seemingly one ought not to enter religion without discussing the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> with one's friends.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> (<a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse28">Luke 14:28</a>) in making a comparison with a man who has a mind to build a tower, says that he doth "first sit down and reckon the charges that are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, whether he have wherewithal to finish it," lest he become an object of mockery, for that "this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> began to build and was not able to finish." Now the wherewithal to build the tower, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. ad Laetum ccxliii), is nothing less than that "each one should renounce all his possessions." Yet it happens sometimes that many cannot do this, nor keep other religious observances; and in signification of this it is stated (<a href="../bible/1sa017.htm#verse39">1 Samuel 17:39</a>) that David could not walk in Saul's armor, for he was not used to it. Therefore it would seem that one ought not to enter religion without long deliberation beforehand and taking counsel of many.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is stated (<a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse20">Matthew 4:20</a>) that upon <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> calling them, Peter and Andrew "immediately leaving their nets, followed Him." Here <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. xiv in Matth.): "Such obedience as this does <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> require of us, that we delay not even for a moment."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Long deliberation and the advice of many are required in great matters of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 3); while advice is unnecessary in matters that are certain and fixed. Now with regard to entering religion three points may be considered. First, the entrance itself into religion, considered by itself; and thus it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that entrance into religion is a greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about this is to disparage <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Who gave this counsel. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Verb. Dom., Serm. c, 2): "The East," that is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, "calleth thee, and thou turnest to the West," namely mortal and fallible <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Secondly, the entrance into religion may be considered in relation to the strength of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who intends to enter. And here again there is no room for <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about the entrance to religion, since those who enter religion trust not to be able to stay by their own power, but by the assistance of the divine power, according to <a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse31">Isaiah 40:31</a>, "They that hope in the Lord shall renew their strength, they shall take wings as eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint." Yet if there be some special obstacle (such as bodily weakness, a burden of debts, or the like) in such cases a man must deliberate and take counsel with such as are likely to help and not hinder him. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/sir037.htm#verse12">Sirach 37:12</a>): "Treat with a man without religion concerning <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> [The <a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay version</a> supplies the negative: 'Treat not . . . nor with . . . '], with an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>," meaning that one should not do so, wherefore the text goes on (<a href="../bible/sir037.htm#verse14">Sirach 37:14-15</a>), "Give no heed to these in any <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of counsel, but be continually with a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." On these matters, however, one should not take long deliberation. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (Ep. and Paulin. liii): "Hasten, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> thee, cut off rather than loosen the rope that holds the boat to the shore." Thirdly, we may consider the way of entering religion, and which order one ought to enter, and about such matters also one may take counsel of those who will not stand in one's way.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The saying: "Try the spirits, if they be of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," applies to matters admitting of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> whether the spirits be of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; thus those who are already in religion may <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> whether he who offers himself to religion be led by the spirit of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or be moved by hypocrisy. Wherefore they must try the postulant whether he be moved by the divine spirit. But for him who seeks to enter religion there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> but that the purpose of entering religion to which his heart has given birth is from the spirit of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for it is His spirit "that leads" <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> "into the land of uprightness" (<a href="../bible/psa142.htm#verse10">Psalm 142:10</a>).

<p>Nor does this <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that it is not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that some turn back; since not all that is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is incorruptible: else corruptible creatures would not be of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the Manicheans hold, nor could some who have <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> lose it, which is also <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> "counsel" whereby He makes even things corruptible and changeable, is imperishable according to <a href="../bible/isa046.htm#verse10">Isaiah 46:10</a>, "My counsel shall stand and all My will shall be done." Hence the purpose of entering religion needs not to be tried whether it be of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because "it requires no further demonstration," as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says on <a href="../bible/1th005.htm#verse21">1 Thessalonians 5:21</a>, "Prove all things."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Even as "the flesh <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusteth</a> against the spirit" (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse17">Galatians 5:17</a>), so too carnal friends often thwart our <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> progress, according to <a href="../bible/mic007.htm#verse6">Micah 7:6</a>, "A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> enemies are they of his own household." Wherefore Cyril expounding <a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse61">Luke 9:61</a>, "Let me first take my leave of them that are at my house," says [Cf. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas's</a> Catena Aurea]: "By asking first to take his leave of them that were at his house, he shows he was somewhat of two minds. For to communicate with his neighbors, and consult those who are unwilling to relish righteousness, is an indication of weakness and turning back. Hence he hears <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> say: 'No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> putting his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>,' because he looks back who seeks delay in order to go home and confer with his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">kinsfolk</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The building of the tower signifies the perfection of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life; and the renunciation of one's possessions is the wherewithal to build this tower. Now no one <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> or deliberates about wishing to have the wherewithal, or whether he is able to build the tower if he have the wherewithal, but what does come under deliberation is whether one has the wherewithal. Again it need not be a matter of deliberation whether one ought to renounce all that one has, or whether by so doing one may be able to attain to perfection; whereas it is a matter of deliberation whether that which one is doing amounts to the renunciation of all that he has, since unless he does renounce (which is to have the wherewithal) he cannot, as the text goes on to state, be Christ's disciple, and this is to build the tower.

<p>The misgiving of those who hesitate as to whether they may be able to attain to perfection by entering religion is shown by many examples to be unreasonable. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. viii, 11): "On that side whither I had set my face, and whither I trembled to go, there appeared to me the chaste dignity of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a> . . . honestly alluring me to come and <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> not, and stretching forth to receive and embrace me, her <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> hands full of multitudes of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> examples. There were so many young men and <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">maidens</a> here, a multitude of youth and every age, grave <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> and aged <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> . . . And she smiled at me with a persuasive mockery as though to say: Canst not thou what these youths and these <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">maidens</a> can? Or can they either in themselves, and not rather in the Lord their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>? . . . Why standest thou in thyself, and so standest not? Cast thyself upon Him; fear not, He will not withdraw Himself that thou shouldst fall. Cast thyself fearlessly upon Him: He will receive and will heal thee."

<p>The example quoted of David is not to the point, because "the arms of Saul," as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on the passage observes, "are the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, as being burdensome": whereas religion is the sweet yoke of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, for as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. iv, 33), "what burden does He lay on the shoulders of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, Who commands us to shun all troublesome desires, Who warns us to turn aside from the rough paths of this world?"

<p>To those indeed who take this sweet yoke upon themselves He promises the refreshment of the divine fruition and the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> rest of their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.

<p>To which may He Who made this promise bring us, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ our Lord</a>, "Who is over all things <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> blessed for ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>."
