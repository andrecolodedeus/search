<h1>Question 18. Christ's unity of will</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/4018.htm#article1"> Are the Divine will and the human distinct in Christ?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4018.htm#article2"> In Christ's human nature, is the will of sensuality distinct from the will of reason?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4018.htm#article3"> As regards the reason, were there several wills in Christ?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4018.htm#article4"> Was there free-will in Christ?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4018.htm#article5"> Was Christ's human will always conformed to the Divine will in the thing willed?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4018.htm#article6"> Was there any contrariety of wills in Christ?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether there are two wills in Christ?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there are not two <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">wills</a>, one Divine, the other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the first mover and first commander in whoever wills. But in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the first mover and commander was the Divine will, since in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> everything <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> was moved by the Divine will. Hence it seems that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was only one will, viz. the Divine.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, an instrument is not moved by its own will but by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of its mover. Now the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was the instrument of His Godhead. Hence the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not moved by its own will, but by the Divine will.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that alone is multiplied in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> which belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does not seem to pertain to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: for <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things are of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>; whereas what is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> is not of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. Therefore there is but one will in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 14) that "to will in this or that way belongs not to our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> but to our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>," i.e. our personal <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. But every <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is this or that will, since there is nothing in a genus which is not at the same time in some one of its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Therefore all will belongs to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. But in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was and is but one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Therefore in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there is only one will.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> says (<a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse42">Luke 22:42</a>): "Father, if Thou wilt, remove this <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> from Me. But yet not My will but Thine be done." And <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a>, quoting this to the Emperor Gratian (De Fide ii, 7) says: "As He assumed my will, He assumed my sorrow;" and on <a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse42">Luke 22:42</a> he says: "His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, He refers to the Man--the Father's, to the Godhead. For the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is temporal, and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Godhead <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some placed only one will in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; but they seem to have had different motives for holding this. For Apollinaris did not hold an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but maintained that the Word was in place of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, or even in place of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Hence since "the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is in the reason," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii, 9), it followed that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will; and thus there was only one will in Him. So, too, Eutyches and all who held one composite <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> were forced to place one will in Him. <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, too, who maintained that the union of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was one of affection and will, held only one will in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But later on, Macarius, Patriarch of Antioch, Cyrus of Alexandria, and Sergius of Constantinople and some of their followers, held that there is one will in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, although they held that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there are two natures united in a hypostasis; because they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> never moved with its own motion, but only inasmuch as it was moved by the Godhead, as is plain from the synodical letter of Pope Agatho [Third Council of Constantinople, Act. 4].

<p>And hence in the sixth Council held at Constantinople [Act. 18] it was decreed that it must be said that there are two wills in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in the following passage: "In accordance with what the Prophets of old taught us concerning <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and as He taught us Himself, and the Symbol of the Holy Fathers has handed down to us, we confess two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> wills in Him and two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> operations." And this much it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to say. For it is manifest that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> assumed a perfect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as was shown above (5; 9, 1). Now the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> pertains to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, being one of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers, even as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as was stated in I, Q79,80. Hence we must say that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> assumed a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will, together with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now by the assumption of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> suffered no diminution of what pertains to His Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, to which it belongs to have a will, as was said in the I, 19, 1. Hence it must be said that there are two wills in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, i.e. one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, the other Divine.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Whatever was in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was moved at the bidding of the Divine will; yet it does not follow that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was no movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> proper to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> wills of other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are moved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will, "Who worketh" in them "both to will and to accomplish," as is written <a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse13">Philippians 2:13</a>. For although the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> cannot be inwardly moved by any creature, yet it can be moved inwardly by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as was said in I, 105, 4. And thus, too, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will followed the Divine will according to <a href="../bible/psa039.htm#verse9">Psalm 39:9</a>; "That I should do Thy will, O my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I have desired it." Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Maxim. ii, 20): "Where the Son says to the Father, 'Not what I will, but what Thou willest,' what do you gain by adding your own words and saying 'He shows that His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> subject to His Father,' as if we denied that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will ought to be subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will?"

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is proper to an instrument to be moved by the principal agent, yet diversely, according to the property of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For an inanimate instrument, as an axe or a saw, is moved by the craftsman with only a corporeal movement; but an instrument animated by a sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is moved by the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, as a horse by its rider; and an instrument animated with a rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is moved by its will, as by the command of his lord the servant is moved to act, the servant being like an animate instrument, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Polit. i, 2,4; Ethic. viii, 11). And hence it was in this manner that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was the instrument of the Godhead, and was moved by its own will.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The power of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> follows upon the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; but the movement or act of this power--which is also called will--is sometimes <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, e.g. with respect to beatitude; and sometimes springs from <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> and is neither <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> nor <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, as is plain from what has been stated in I-II, 10, 1,2 [Cf. I, 82, 2]. And yet even reason itself, which is the principle of this movement, is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>. Hence besides the Divine will it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to place in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will, not merely as a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power, or a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> movement, but even as a rational movement.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> When we say "to will in a certain way," we signify a determinate mode of willing. Now a determinate mode regards the thing of which it is the mode. Hence since the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> pertains to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, "to will in a certain way" belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, not indeed considered absolutely, but as it is in the hypostasis. Hence the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had a determinate mode from the fact of being in a Divine hypostasis, i.e. it was always moved in accordance with the bidding of the Divine will.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether in Christ there was a will of sensuality besides the will of reason?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was no will of sensuality besides the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of reason. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii, text. 42) that "the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is in the reason, and in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> are the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> parts." Now sensuality signifies the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Hence in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was no will of sensuality.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. xii, 12,13) the sensuality is signified by the serpent. But there was nothing serpent-like in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; for He had the likeness of a venomous animal without the venom, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Pecc. Merit. et Remiss. i, 32). Hence in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was no will of sensuality.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is consequent upon <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as was said (1). But in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was only one <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> besides the Divine. Hence in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was only one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Fide ii, 7): "Mine is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> which He calls His own; because as Man He assumed my sorrow." From this we are given to understand that sorrow pertains to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Now sorrow pertains to the sensuality, as was said in I-II, 23, 1; I-II, 25, 1. Therefore, seemingly, in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there is a will of sensuality besides the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of reason.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was said (9, 1), the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> assumed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> together with everything pertaining to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is included animal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as the genus in its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> must have assumed together with the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> whatever belongs to animal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; one of which things is the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, which is called the sensuality. Consequently it must be allowed that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was a sensual <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, or sensuality. But it must be borne in mind that sensuality or the sensual <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, inasmuch as it <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> obeys reason, is said to be "rational by participation," as is clear from the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. i, 13). And because "the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is in the reason," as stated above, it may equally be said that the sensuality is "a will by participation."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument is based on the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> so called, which is only in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> part; but the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> by participation can be in the sensitive part, inasmuch as it obeys reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The sensuality is signified by the serpent--not as regards the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the sensuality, which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> assumed, but as regards the corruption of the "fomes," which was not in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> "Where there is one thing on account of another, there seems to be only one" (<a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, Topic. iii); thus a surface which is visible by color is one visible thing with the color. So, too, because the sensuality is called the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, only because it partakes of the rational will, there is said to be but one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, even as there is but one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether in Christ there were two wills as regards the reason?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there were two wills as regards the reason. For <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 22) that there is a double will in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, viz. the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> will which is called <em>thelesis</em>, and the rational will which is called <em>boulesis</em>. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> had whatever belongs to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence both the foregoing wills were in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power is diversified in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by the difference of the apprehensive power, and hence according to the difference of sense and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the difference of sensitive and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But in the same way as regards <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> apprehension, we hold the difference of reason and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; both of which were in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore there was a double will in Him, one <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and the other rational.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, some [<a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugh of St. Victor</a>, De Quat. Volunt. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.] ascribe to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> "a will of piety," which can only be on the part of reason. Therefore in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> on the part of reason there are several wills.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> In every order there is one first mover. But the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the first mover in the genus of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>. Therefore in one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> there is only one <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, properly speaking, which is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of reason. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there is only one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1, ad 3), the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is sometimes taken for the power, and sometimes for the act. Hence if the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is taken for the act, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to place two <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">wills</a>, i.e. two <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of acts of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> on the part of the reason. For the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as was said in I-II, 8, 2,3, regards both the end and the means; and is affected differently towards both. For towards the end it is borne simply and absolutely, as towards what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in itself; but towards the means it is borne under a certain relation, as the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the means depends on something else. Hence the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, inasmuch as it is drawn to anything desired of itself, as health, which act is called by <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> <em>thelesis</em>--i.e. simple will, and by the masters "will as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>," is different from the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as it is drawn to anything that is desired only in order to something else, as to take medicine; and this act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> calls <em>boulesis</em>--i.e. counseling will, and the masters, "will as reason." But this diversity of acts does not diversify the power, since both acts regard the one common ratio of the object, which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Hence we must say that if we are speaking of the power of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there is but one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> so called and not by participation; but if we are speaking of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as an act, we thus distinguish in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> a will as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which is called <em>thelesis</em>, and a will as reason, which is called <em>boulesis</em>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> These two wills do not diversify the power but only the act, as we have said.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and the reason are not distinct powers, as was said in I, 79, 8.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The "will of piety" would not seem to be distinct from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> considered as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, inasmuch as it shrinks from another's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, absolutely considered.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether there was free-will in Christ?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was no <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 14) that <em>gnome</em>, i.e. opinion, thinking or cogitation, and <em>proairesis</em>, i.e. choice, "cannot possibly be attributed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>, if we wish to speak with propriety." But in the things of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> especially we must speak with propriety. Therefore there was no choice in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and consequently no <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, of which choice is the act.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 2) that choice is "a desire of something after taking counsel." Now counsel does not appear to be in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, because we do not take counsel concerning such things as we are certain of. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was certain of everything. Hence there was no counsel and consequently no <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is indifferent. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> will was determined to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since He could not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; as stated above (15, 1,2). Hence there was no <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/isa007.htm#verse15">Isaiah 7:15</a>): "He shall eat butter and honey, that He may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to refuse the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and to choose the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," which is an act of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. Therefore there was <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was said above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), there was a twofold act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; one whereby He was drawn to anything willed in itself, which implies the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an end; the other whereby His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> was drawn to anything willed on account of its being ordained to another--which pertains to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of means. Now, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 2) choice differs from will in this, that will of itself regards the end, while choice regards the means. And thus simple <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the same as the "will as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>"; but choice is the same as the "will as reason," and is the proper act of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, as was said in I, 83, 3. Hence, since "will as reason" is placed in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, we must also place choice, and consequently <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, whose act is choice, as was said in I, 83, 3; I-II, 13, 1.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> excludes choice from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in so far as he considers that <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> is implied in the word choice. Nevertheless <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to choice, since it belongs even to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself to choose, according to <a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse4">Ephesians 1:4</a>: "He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world," although in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. Yet <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to choice when it is in an <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. We may also say the same of whatever else is mentioned in the passage quoted.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Choice presupposes counsel; yet it follows counsel only as determined by judgment. For what we judge to be done, we choose, after the inquiry of counsel, as is stated (Ethic. iii, 2,3). Hence if anything is judged <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to be done, without any preceding <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> or inquiry, this suffices for choice. Therefore it is plain that <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> or inquiry belong to choice not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, but only when it is in an <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The will of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, though determined to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, is not determined to this or that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Hence it pertains to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, even as to the blessed, to choose with a <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> confirmed in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the human will of Christ was altogether conformed to the Divine will in the thing willed?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not will anything except what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> willed. For it is written (<a href="../bible/psa039.htm#verse9">Psalm 39:9</a>) in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Christ: "That I should do Thy will: O my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I have desired it." Now he who desires to do another's will, wills what the other wills. Hence it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will willed nothing but what was willed by His Divine will.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> had most perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which, indeed, surpasses the comprehension of all our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, according to <a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse19">Ephesians 3:19</a>, "the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which surpasseth all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> makes men will what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills; hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ix, 4) that one mark of friendship is "to will and choose the same." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> willed nothing else than was willed by His Divine will.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> comprehensor. But the Saints who are comprehensors in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> will only what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills, otherwise they would not be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, because they would not obtain whatever they will, for "blessed is he who has what he wills, and wills nothing amiss," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiii, 5). Hence in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will Christ wills nothing else than does the Divine will.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Maxim. ii, 20): "When <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> says 'Not what I will, but what Thou wilt' He shows Himself to have willed something else than did His Father; and this could only have been by His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> heart, since He did not transfigure our weakness into His Divine but into His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was said (2,3), in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> according to His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> there is a twofold will, viz. the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of sensuality, which is called will by participation, and the rational will, whether considered after the manner of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, or after the manner of reason. Now it was said above (13, 3, ad 1; 14, 1, ad 2) that by a certain dispensation the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> before His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> "allowed His flesh to do and suffer what belonged to it." And in like manner He allowed all the powers of His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to do what belonged to them. Now it is clear that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of sensuality <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> shrinks from sensible pains and bodily hurt. In like manner, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> turns from what is against <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in itself, as death and the like; yet the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as reason may at time choose these things in relation to an end, as in a mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> the sensuality and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> absolutely considered shrink from burning, which, nevertheless, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as reason may choose for the sake of health. Now it was the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should undergo pain, suffering, and death, not that these of themselves were willed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but for the sake of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Hence it is plain that in His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of sensuality and in His rational will considered as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> could will what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> did not; but in His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as reason He always willed the same as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which appears from what He says (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse39">Matthew 26:39</a>): "Not as I will, but as Thou wilt." For He willed in His reason that the Divine will should be fulfilled although He said that He willed something else by another will.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> By His rational will Christ willed the Divine will to be fulfilled; but not by His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of sensuality, the movement of which does not extend to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>--nor by His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> considered as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which regards things absolutely considered and not in relation to the Divine will.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The conformity of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will to the Divine regards the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of reason: according to which the wills even of friends agree, inasmuch as reason considers something willed in its relation to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of a friend.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was at once comprehensor and wayfarer, inasmuch as He was enjoying <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His mind and had a passible body. Hence things repugnant to His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> will and to His sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> could happen to Him in His passible flesh.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether there was contrariety of wills in Christ?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there was contrariety of wills in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For contrariety of wills regards contrariety of objects, as contrariety of movements springs from contrariety of termini, as is plain from the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Phys. v, text. 49, seq.). Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in His different wills wished contrary things. For in His Divine will He wished for death, from which He shrank in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will, hence <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> says [De Incarnat. et Cont. Arianos, written against Apollinarius]: "When <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> says 'Father, if it be possible, let this <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> pass from Me; yet not My will, but Thine be done,' and again, 'The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh weak,' He denotes two <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">wills</a>--the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, which through the weakness of the flesh shrank from the passion--and His Divine will eager for the passion." Hence there was contrariety of wills in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse17">Galatians 5:17</a>) that "the flesh <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusteth</a> against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh." Now when the spirit desires one thing, and the flesh another, there is contrariety of wills. But this was in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; for by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> was <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> in His mind, He willed the passion, according to <a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse7">Isaiah 53:7</a>: "He was offered because it was His own will," yet in His flesh He shrank from the passion. Therefore there was contrariety of wills in Him.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse43">Luke 22:43</a>) that "being in an agony, He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> the longer." Now agony seems to imply a certain struggle [Greek, <em>agonia</em>] in a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> drawn to contrary things. Hence it seems that there was contrariety of will in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> In the decisions of the Sixth Council [Third Council of Constantinople, Act. 18] it is said: "We confess two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> wills, not in opposition, as evil-minded <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> assert, but following His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will, and neither withstanding nor striving against, but rather being subject to, His Divine and <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> will."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Contrariety can <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> only where there is opposition in the same and as regards the same. For if the diversity <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> as regards diverse things, and in diverse subjects, this would not suffice for the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of contrariety, nor even for the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of contradiction, e.g. if a man were well formed or healthy as regards his hand, but not as regards his foot. Hence for there to be contrariety of wills in anyone it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, first, that the diversity of wills should regard the same. For if the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of one regards the doing of something with reference to some universal reason, and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of another regards the not doing the same with reference to some particular reason, there is not complete contrariety of will, e.g. when a judge wishes a brigand to be hanged for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the commonwealth, and one of the latter's kindred wishes him not to be hanged on account of a private love, there is no contrariety of wills; unless, indeed, the desire of the private <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> went so far as to wish to hinder the public <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for the private <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>--in that case the opposition of wills would regard the same.

<p>Secondly, for contrariety of wills it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that it should be in the same will. For if a man wishes one thing with his rational <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, and wishes another thing with his sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, there is no contrariety, unless the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> so far prevailed as to change or at least keep back the rational <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; for in this case something of the contrary movement of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> would reach the rational will.

<p>And hence it must be said that although the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and the sensitive will in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> wished what the Divine will did not wish, yet there was no contrariety of wills in Him. First, because neither the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> will nor the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of sensuality rejected the reason for which the Divine will and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> wished the passion. For the absolute will of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> wished the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, although it did not pertain to it to will this for the sake of something further; but the movement of sensuality could nowise extend so far. Secondly, because neither the Divine will nor the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of reason in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was impeded or retarded by the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> will or the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> of sensuality. So, too, on the other hand, neither the Divine will nor the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of reason in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> shrank from or retarded the movement of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will and the movement of the sensuality in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For it pleased <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in His Divine will, and in His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, that His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> will and will of sensuality should be moved according to the order of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence it is clear that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was no opposition or contrariety of wills.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The fact of any will in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> willing something else than did the Divine will, proceeded from the Divine will, by whose permission the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was moved by its proper movements, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 15,18,19).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In us the desires of the spirit are impeded or retarded by the desires of the flesh: this did not occur in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Hence in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was no contrariety of flesh and spirit, as in us.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The agony in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not in the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in as far as it implies a struggle in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> arising from a diversity of motives, as when anyone, on his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> considering one, wishes one thing, and on its considering another, wishes the contrary. For this springs from the weakness of the reason, which is unable to judge which is the best simply. Now this did not occur in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, since by His reason He judged it best that the Divine will regarding the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> should be fulfilled by His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">passion</a>. Nevertheless, there was an agony in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as regards the sensitive part, inasmuch as it implied a dread of coming trial, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 15; iii, 18,23).
