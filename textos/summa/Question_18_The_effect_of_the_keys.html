<h1>Question 18. The effect of the keys</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5018.htm#article1"> Does the power of the keys extend to the remission of guilt?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5018.htm#article2"> Can a priest remit sin as to the punishment?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5018.htm#article3"> Can a priest bind in virtue of the power of the keys?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5018.htm#article4"> Can he loose and bind according to his own judgment?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the power of the keys extends to the remission of guilt? [St. Thomas here follows the opinion of Peter Lombard, and replies in the negative. Later in life he altered his opinion. Cf. III, 62, 1; III, 64, 1; III, 86, 6]</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> extends to the remission of guilt. For it was said to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse23">John 20:23</a>): "Whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> you shall forgive, they are forgiven them." Now this was not said in reference to the declaration only, as the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> states (Sent. iv, D, 18), for in that case the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> would have no more power than the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. Therefore he exercises a power over the remission of the guilt.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in Penance <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is given for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is the dispenser of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> by virtue of the keys. Therefore, since <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is opposed to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, not on the part of the punishment, but on the part of the guilt, it seems that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> operates unto the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by virtue of the keys.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> receives more power by his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> than the baptismal water by its sanctification. Now the baptismal water receives the power "to touch the body and cleanse the heart," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. lxxx in Joan.). Much more, therefore, does the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, in his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, receive the power to cleanse the heart from the stain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> stated above (Sent. iv, D, 18) that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has not bestowed on the minister the power to co-operate with Him in the inward cleansing. Now if he remitted <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> as to the guilt, he would co-operate with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the inward cleansing. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> does not extend to the remission of guilt.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not remitted save by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. But no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has the power to give the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> said above (Sent. i, D, 14). Neither therefore can he remit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> as to their guilt.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to Hugh (De Sacram. ii), "the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, by virtue of their sanctification, contain an invisible <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>." Now this sanctification is sometimes <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the sacrament both as regards the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and as regards the minister, as may be seen in Confirmation, and then the sacramental <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is in both together. Sometimes, however, the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the sacrament requires only sanctification of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, which has no fixed minister on whom it depends <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a>, and then the whole <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the sacrament is in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Again, sometimes the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the sacrament requires the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> or sanctification of the minister without any sanctification of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and then the entire sacramental <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is in the minister, as in Penance. Hence the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> which is in the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, stands in the same relation to the effect of Penance, as the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in the baptismal water does to the effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a> agree somewhat in their effect, since each is directly ordained against guilt, which is not the case in the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>: yet they differ in this, that the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a>, since the acts of the recipient are as its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, cannot be given save to adults, who need to be disposed for the reception of the sacramental effect; whereas <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is given, sometimes to adults, sometimes to children and others who lack the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, so that by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> children receive <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> without any previous disposition, while adults do not, for they require to be disposed by the removal of insincerity. This disposition sometimes precedes their <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> by priority of time, being sufficient for the reception of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, before they are actually <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, but not before they have come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and have conceived the desire for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. At other times this disposition does not precede the reception of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> by a priority of time, but is simultaneous with it, and then the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the remission of guilt is bestowed through the reception of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is never given through the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a> unless the recipient be disposed either simultaneously or before. Hence the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> operates unto the remission of guilt, either through being desired or through being actually exercised, even as the waters of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. But just as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> acts, not as a principal agent but as an instrument, and does not go so far as to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the reception itself of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, even instrumentally [See note at beginning of this article], but merely disposes the recipient to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> whereby his guilt is remitted, so is it with the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone directly remits guilt, and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> acts through His power instrumentally, as an inanimate instrument, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> as an animate instrument, such as a servant is, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. viii, 11): and consequently the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> acts as a minister. Hence it is clear that the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> is ordained, in a manner, to the remission of guilt, not as <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> that remission, but as disposing thereto. Consequently if a man, before receiving <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>, were not perfectly disposed for the reception of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, he would receive <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> at the very time of sacramental confession and <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>, provided he offered no obstacle. For if the key were in no way ordained to the remission of guilt, but only to the remission of punishment, as some hold, it would not be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to have a desire of receiving the effect of the keys in order to have one's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> forgiven, just as it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to have a desire of receiving the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which are ordained, not to the remission of guilt, but against punishment. But this enables us to see that it is not ordained unto the remission of guilt, because the use of the keys, in order to be effective, always requires a disposition on the part of the recipient of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. And the same would apply to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, were it never given save to adults.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> says in the text (Sent. iv, D, 18), the power of forgiving <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> was entrusted to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, not that they may forgive them, by their own power, for this belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but that, as ministers, they may declare [See note at the beginning of this article] the operation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who forgives. Now this happens in three ways. First, by a declaration, not of present, but of future forgiveness, without co-operating therein in any way: and thus the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> signified the Divine operation, so that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> did but declare and did not operate the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Secondly, by a declaration of present forgiveness without co-operating in it at all: and thus some say that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> signify the bestowal of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gives when the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are conferred, without the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> containing any power productive of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, according to which opinion, even the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> would merely declare the Divine operation that has its effect in the remission of guilt when the sacrament is conferred. Thirdly, by signifying the Divine operation <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> then and there the remission of guilt, and by co-operating towards this effect dispositively and instrumentally: and then, according to another and more common opinion, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> declare the cleansing effected by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In this way also the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> declares the recipient to be <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> from guilt, because in speaking of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, what is ascribed to the power of the ministers must be consistent with the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Nor is it unreasonable that the keys of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should dispose the penitent to the remission of his guilt, from the fact that the guilt is already remitted, even as neither is it unreasonable that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, considered in itself, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a disposition in one who is already sanctified.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Neither the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a>, nor the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a>, by its operation, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, or the remission of guilt, directly, but only dispositively [<a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> here follows the opinion of <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>, and replies in the negative. Later in life he altered his opinion. Cf. III, 62, 1; III, 64, 1; III, 86, 6]. Hence the Reply to the Third Objection is evident. The other arguments show that the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> does not effect the remission of guilt directly, and this is to be granted.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether a priest can remit sin as to the punishment?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> cannot remit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as to the punishment. For <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> deserves <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and temporal punishment. But after the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> the penitent is still <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to undergo temporal punishment either in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> or in this world. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> does not remit the punishment in any way.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> cannot anticipate the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> appoints the punishment which penitents have to undergo. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> cannot remit any part of it.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a man who has committed a slight <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is not less susceptible to the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a>, than one who has committed a graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now if the punishment for the graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be lessened in any way through the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> administrations, it would be possible for a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to be so slight that the punishment which it deserves is no greater than that which has been remitted for the graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> would be able to remit the entire punishment due for the slight <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: which is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the whole of the temporal punishment due for a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is of one kind. If, therefore, by a first <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> something is taken away from the punishment, it will be possible for something more to be taken away by a second <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>, so that the <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> can be so often repeated, that by virtue of the keys the whole punishment will be taken away, since the second <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> is not less efficacious than the first: and consequently that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> will be altogether unpunished, which is absurd.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The key is the power of binding and loosing. But the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> can enjoin a temporal punishment. Therefore he can <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> from punishment.

<p>Further, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> cannot remit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> either as to the guilt [<a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> here follows the opinion of <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>, and replies in the negative. Later in life he altered his opinion. Cf. III, 62, 1; III, 64, 1; III, 86, 6], as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 18), or as to the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a>, for a like reason. If therefore he cannot remit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as to the temporal punishment, he would be unable to remit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in any way, which is altogether contrary to the words of the Gospel.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Whatever may be said of the effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> conferred on one who has already received <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, applies equally to the effect of the actual exercise of the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> on one who has already been <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a>. For a man may obtain the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the remission of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> as to their guilt, through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, previous to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>; but when, afterwards, he actually receives <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, his <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is increased, and he is entirely <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> from the debt of punishment, since he is then made a partaker of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion of Christ</a>. In like manner when a man, through <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, has received the pardon of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> as to their guilt, and consequently as to the debt of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a>, (which is remitted together with the guilt) by virtue of the keys which derive their efficacy from the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion of Christ</a>, his <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is increased and the temporal punishment is remitted, the debt of which remained after the guilt had been forgiven. However, this temporal punishment is not entirely remitted, as in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, but only partly, because the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who is regenerated in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is conformed to the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion of Christ</a>, by receiving into himself entirely the efficacy of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, which suffices for the blotting out of all punishment, so that nothing remains of the punishment due to his preceding actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For nothing should be imputed to a man unto punishment, save what he has done himself, and in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> begins a new life, and by the baptismal water becomes a new <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as that no debt for previous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> remains in him. on the other hand, in Penance, a man does not take on a new life, since therein he is not born again, but healed. Consequently by virtue of the keys which produce their effect in the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a>, the punishment is not entirely remitted, but something is taken off the temporal punishment, the debt of which could remain after the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a> had been remitted. Nor does this apply only to the temporal punishment which the penitent owes at the time of confession, as some hold, (for then confession and sacramental <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> would be mere burdens, which cannot be said of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>), but also to the punishment due in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>, so that one who has been <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> and dies before making satisfaction, is less punished in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>, than if he had died before receiving <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> does not remit the entire temporal punishment, but part of it; wherefore the penitent still remains <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to undergo satisfactory punishment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> was sufficiently satisfactory for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the whole world, so that without prejudice to Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> something can be remitted from the punishment which a sinner deserves, in so far as the effect of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> reaches him through the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Some satisfactory punishment must remain for each <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so as to provide a remedy against it. Wherefore though, by virtue of the <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> some measure of the punishment due to a grave <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is remitted, it does not follow that the same measure of punishment is remitted for each <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because in that case some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> would remain without any punishment at all: but, by virtue of the keys, the punishments due to various <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are remitted in due proportion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Some say that at the first <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>, as much as possible is remitted by virtue of the keys, and that, nevertheless, the second confession is valid, on account of the instruction received, on account of the additional surety, on account of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or confessor, and lastly on account of the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of the shame.

<p>But this does not seem to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, for though there might be a reason for repeating the confession, there would be no reason for repeating the <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>, especially if the penitent has no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about his previous <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>; for he might just as well <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> after the second as after the first <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>: even as we see that the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> is not repeated during the same sickness, for the reason that all that could be done through the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, has been done once. Moreover, in the second confession, there would be no need for the confessor to have the keys, if the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> had no effect therein.

<p>For these reasons others say that even in the second <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> something of the punishment is remitted by virtue of the keys, because when <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> is given a second time, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is increased, and the greater the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> received, the less there remains of the blemish of the previous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and the less punishment is required to remove that blemish. Wherefore even when a man is first <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a>, his punishment is more or less remitted by virtue of the keys, according as he disposes himself more or less to receive <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; and this disposition may be so great, that even by virtue of his <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> the whole punishment is remitted, as we have already stated (5, 2). Consequently it is not unreasonable, if by frequent confession even the whole punishment be remitted, that a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> remain altogether unpunished, since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> made satisfaction for its punishment.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the priest can bind through the power of the keys?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> cannot bind by virtue of the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a>. For the sacramental power is ordained as a remedy against <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now binding is not a remedy for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but seemingly is rather conducive to an aggravation of the disease. Therefore, by the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a>, which is a sacramental power, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> cannot bind.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as to loose or to open is to remove an obstacle, so to bind is to place an obstacle. Now an obstacle to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which cannot be placed on us by an extrinsic <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, since no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is committed except by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> cannot bind.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the keys derive their efficacy from <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>. But binding is not an effect of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> cannot bind by the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse19">Matthew 16:19</a>): "Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth, shall be bound also in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>."

<p>Further, rational powers are directed to opposites. But the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> is a rational power, since it has discretion connected with it. Therefore it is directed to opposites. Therefore if it can loose, it can bind.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The operation of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in using the keys, is conformed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> operation, Whose minister he is. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> operation extends both to guilt and to punishment; to the guilt indeed, so as to loose it directly. but to bind it indirectly, in so far as He is said to harden, when He withholds His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; whereas His operation extends to punishment directly, in both respects, because He both spares and inflicts it. In like manner, therefore, although the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, in absolving, exercises an operation ordained to the remission of guilt, in the way mentioned above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), nevertheless, in binding, he exercises no operation on the guilt; (unless he be said to bind by not absolving the penitent and by declaring him to be bound), but he has the power both of binding and of loosing with regard to the punishment. For he looses from the punishment which he remits, while he binds as to the punishment which remains. This he does in two ways--first as regards the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the punishment considered in general, and thus he does not bind save by not loosing, and declaring the penitent to be bound, secondly, as regards this or that particular punishment, and thus he binds to punishment by imposing it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The remainder of the punishment to which the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> binds the penitent, is the medicine which cleanses the latter from the blemish of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Not only <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but also punishment is an obstacle to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: and how the latter is enjoined by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, has been said in the article.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Even the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion of Christ</a> binds us to some punishment whereby we are conformed to Him.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the priest can bind and loose according to his own judgment?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> can bind and loose according to his own judgment. For <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> [Cf. Can. 86, Mensuram, De Poenit. Dist. i] says: "The canons do not fix the length of time for doing penance so precisely as to say how each <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is to be amended, but leave the decision of this matter to the judgment of a discreet <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>." Therefore it seems that he can bind and loose according to his own judgment.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "The Lord commended the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> steward, forasmuch as he had done wisely" (<a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse5">Luke 16:5</a>), because he had allowed a liberal discount to his master's debtors. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is more inclined to mercy than any temporal lord. Therefore it seems that the more punishment the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> remits, the more he is to be commended.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> every action is our instruction. Now on some sinners He imposed no punishment, but only amendment of life, as in the case of the <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulterous</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> (<a href="../bible/joh008.htm">John 8</a>). Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> also, who is the vicar of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, can, according to his own judgment, remit the punishment, either wholly or in part.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> [Cf. Act. Concil. Rom. v, Can. 5 says: "We declare it a mock penance if it is not imposed according to the authority of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers in proportion to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." Therefore it seems that it does not altogether depend on the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> judgment.

<p>Further, the act of the keys requires discretion. Now if the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> could remit and impose as much as he liked of a penance, he would have no need of discretion, because there would be no room for indiscretion. Therefore it does not altogether depend on the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> judgment.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In using the keys, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> acts as the instrument and minister of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now no instrument can have an efficacious act, except in so far as it is moved by the principal agent. Wherefore, <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Hier. Eccl. cap. ult.) that "<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> should use their <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchical</a> powers, according as they are moved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." A sign of this is that before the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> was conferred on Peter (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse19">Matthew 16:19</a>) mention is made of the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> vouchsafed to him of the Godhead; and the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, whereby "the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are led" (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse14">Romans 8:14</a>), is mentioned before power was given to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Consequently if anyone were to presume to use his power against that Divine motion, he would not realize the effect, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> states (Hier. Eccl., cap. ult.), and, besides, he would be turned away from the Divine order, and consequently would be guilty of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Moreover, since satisfactory punishments are medicinal, just as the medicines prescribed by the medical art are not suitable to all, but have to be changed according to the judgment of a medical <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who follows not his own will, but his medical science, so the satisfactory punishments appointed by the canons are not suitable to all, but have to be varied according to the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> guided by the Divine instinct. Therefore just as sometimes the physician prudently refrains from giving a medicine sufficiently efficacious to heal the disease, lest a greater danger should arise on account of the weakness of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> so the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, moved by Divine instinct, some times refrains from enjoining the entire punishment due to one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, lest by the severity of the punishment, the sick <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> come to <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> and turn away altogether from repentance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This judgment should be guided entirely by the Divine instinct.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The steward is commended also for having done wisely. Therefore in the remission of the due punishment, there is need for discretion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had the power of "excellence" in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, so that, by His own authority, He could remit the punishment wholly or in part, just as He chose. Therefore there is no comparison between Him and those who act merely as ministers.
