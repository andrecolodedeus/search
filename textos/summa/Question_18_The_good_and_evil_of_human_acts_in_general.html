<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether every human action is good, or are there evil actions?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> action is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and that none is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> acts not, save in virtue of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is done in virtue of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore no action is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, nothing acts except in so far as it is in act. Now a thing is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, not according as it is in act, but according as its <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> is void of act; whereas in so far as its <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> is perfected by act, it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as stated in Metaph. ix, 9. Therefore nothing acts in so far as it is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but only according as it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore every action is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and none is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> cannot be a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, save <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> declares (Div. Nom. iv). But every action has some effect which is proper to it. Therefore no action is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but every action is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse20">John 3:20</a>): "Every one that doth <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, hateth the light." Therefore some actions of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We must speak of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in actions as of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in things: because such as everything is, such is the act that it produces. Now in things, each one has so much <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as it has being: since <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and being are convertible, as was stated in the I, 5, 1,3. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone has the whole plenitude of His Being in a certain unity: whereas every other thing has its proper fulness of being in a certain multiplicity. Wherefore it happens with some things, that they have being in some respect, and yet they are lacking in the fulness of being due to them. Thus the fulness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human being</a> requires a compound of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, having all the powers and instruments of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and movement: wherefore if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be lacking in any of these, he is lacking in something due to the fulness of his being. So that as much as he has of being, so much has he of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>: while so far as he is lacking in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, and is said to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: thus a blind <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is possessed of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> inasmuch as he lives; and of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, inasmuch as he lacks sight. That, however, which has nothing of being or <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, could not be said to be either <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> or <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But since this same fulness of being is of the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, if a thing be lacking in its due fulness of being, it is not said to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> simply, but in a certain respect, inasmuch as it is a being; although it can be called a being simply, and a non-being in a certain respect, as was stated in the I, 5, 1, ad 1. We must therefore say that every action has <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, in so far as it has being; whereas it is lacking in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, in so far as it is lacking in something that is due to its fulness of being; and thus it is said to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: for instance if it lacks the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> determined by reason, or its due place, or something of the kind.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">Evil</a> acts in virtue of deficient <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. For it there were nothing of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> there, there would be neither being nor possibility of action. On the other hand if <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> were not deficient, there would be no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Consequently the action done is a deficient <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in a certain respect, but simply <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Nothing hinders a thing from being in act in a certain respect, so that it can act; and in a certain respect deficient in act, so as to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a deficient act. Thus a blind <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has in act the power of walking, whereby he is able to walk; but inasmuch as he is deprived of sight he suffers a defect in walking by stumbling when he walks.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> An <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> action can have a proper effect, according to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and being that it has. Thus <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> generation, inasmuch as it implies union of male and female, but not inasmuch as it lacks the order of reason.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the good or evil of a man's action is derived from its object?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of an action is not derived from its object. For the object of any action is a thing. But "<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not in things, but in the sinner's use of them," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. iii, 12). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> action is not derived from their object.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the object is compared to the action as its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of a thing is not from its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but rather from the form, which is an act. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in actions is not derived from their object.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the object of an active power is compared to the action as effect to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> does not depend on its effect; rather is it the reverse. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in actions is not derived from their object.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/hos009.htm#verse10">Hosea 9:10</a>): "They became abominable as those things which they loved." Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> becomes abominable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on account of the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of his action. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of his action is according to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> objects that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> loves. And the same applies to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of his action.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>) the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of an action, as of other things, depends on its fulness of being or its lack of that fulness. Now the first thing that belongs to the fulness of being seems to be that which gives a thing its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. And just as a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> thing has its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, so an action has its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from its object, as movement from its term. And therefore just as the primary <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> thing is derived from its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, which gives it its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, so the primary <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of a moral action is derived from its suitable object: hence some call such an action "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in its genus"; for instance, "to make use of what is one's own." And just as, in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things, the primary <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is when a generated thing does not realize its specific form (for instance, if instead of a man, something else be generated); so the primary <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in moral actions is that which is from the object, for instance, "to take what belongs to another." And this action is said to be "<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in its genus," genus here standing for <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, just as we apply the term "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>" to the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although external things are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in themselves, nevertheless they have not always a due proportion to this or that action. And so, inasmuch as they are considered as objects of such actions, they have not the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The object is not the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> "of which" (a thing is made), but the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> "about which" (something is done); and stands in relation to the act as its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, as it were, through giving it its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The object of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> action is not always the object of an active power. For the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power is, in a way, passive; in so far as it is moved by the appetible object; and yet it is a principle of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions. Nor again have the objects of the active powers always the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an effect, but only when they are already transformed: thus food when transformed is the effect of the nutritive power; whereas food before being transformed stands in relation to the nutritive power as the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> about which it exercises its operation. Now since the object is in some way the effect of the active power, it follows that it is the term of its action, and consequently that it gives it its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> and <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, since movement derives its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from its term. Moreover, although the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of an action is not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of its effect, yet an action is said to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> from the fact that it can produce a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> effect. Consequently the very proportion of an action to its effect is the measure of its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether man's action is good or evil from a circumstance?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that an action is not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> from a circumstance. For circumstances stand around [circumstant] an action, as being outside it, as stated above (Question 7, Article 1). But "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> are in things themselves," as is stated in Metaph. vi, 4. Therefore an action does not derive <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> from a circumstance.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of an action is considered principally in the doctrine of morals. But since circumstances are <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> of actions, it seems that they are outside the scope of art: because "no art takes notice of what is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>" (Metaph. vi, 2). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of an action is not taken from a circumstance.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that which belongs to a thing, in respect of its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, is not ascribed to it in respect of an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> belong to an action in respect of its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>; because an action can be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in its genus as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Therefore an action is not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or bad from a circumstance.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 3) that a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> acts as he should, and when he should, and so on in respect of the other circumstances. Therefore, on the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of each <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, acts when he should not, or where he should not, and so on with the other circumstances. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> according to circumstances.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things, it is to be noted that the whole fulness of perfection due to a thing, is not from the mere <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form, that gives it its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; since a thing derives much from supervening <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does from shape, color, and the like; and if any one of these <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> be out of due proportion, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is the result. So it is with action. For the plenitude of its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> does not consist wholly in its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but also in certain additions which accrue to it by reason of certain <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>: and such are its due circumstances. Wherefore if something be wanting that is requisite as a due circumstance the action will be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Circumstances are outside an action, inasmuch as they are not part of its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; but they are in an action as <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> thereof. Thus, too, <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> are outside the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Every <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> is not <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> in its subject; for some are proper <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>; and of these every art takes notice. And thus it is that the circumstances of actions are considered in the doctrine of morals.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and being are convertible; according as being is predicated of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> and of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, so is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> predicated of a thing both in respect of its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> being, and in respect of its <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> being; and this, both in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things and in moral actions.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether a human action is good or evil from its end?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions are not from the end. For <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that "nothing acts with a view to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." If therefore an action were <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> from its end, no action would be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Which is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of an action is something in the action. But the end is an extrinsic <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Therefore an action is not said to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or bad according to its end.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> action may happen to be ordained to an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> end, as when a man gives an <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> from vainglory; and conversely, an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> action may happen to be ordained to a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> end, as a <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> committed in order to give something to the poor. Therefore an action is not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> from its end.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Differ. Topic. ii) that "if the end is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, the thing is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and if the end be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, the thing also is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The disposition of things as to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is the same as their disposition as to being. Now in some things the being does not depend on another, and in these it suffices to consider their being absolutely. But there are things the being of which depends on something else, and hence in their regard we must consider their being in its relation to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> on which it depends. Now just as the being of a thing depends on the agent, and the form, so the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of a thing depends on its end. Hence in the Divine Persons, Whose <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> does not depend on another, the measure of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is not taken from the end. Whereas <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions, and other things, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of which depends on something else, have a measure of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> from the end on which they depend, besides that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> which is in them absolutely.

<p>Accordingly a fourfold <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> may be considered in a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> action. First, that which, as an action, it derives from its genus; because as much as it has of action and being so much has it of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Secondly, it has <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> according to its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; which is derived from its suitable object. Thirdly, it has <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> from its circumstances, in respect, as it were, of its <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>. Fourthly, it has <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> from its end, to which it is compared as to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in view of which one acts is not always a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; but sometimes it is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, sometimes an apparent <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. And in the latter event, an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> action results from the end in view.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although the end is an extrinsic <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, nevertheless due proportion to the end, and relation to the end, are inherent to the action.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Nothing hinders an action that is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in one of the way mentioned above, from lacking <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> in another way. And thus it may happen that an action which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> or in its circumstances is ordained to an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> end, or vice versa. However, an action is not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> simply, unless it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in all those ways: since "<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> results from any single defect, but <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> from the complete <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>," as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv).

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether a human action is good or evil in its species?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in moral actions do not make a difference of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in actions is in conformity with their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in things, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). But <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> do not make a specific difference in things; for a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is specifically the same as a bad <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore neither do they make a specific difference in actions.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, since <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is a privation, it is a non-being. But non-being cannot be a difference, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. iii, 3). Since therefore the difference constitutes the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, it seems that an action is not constituted in a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> through being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Consequently <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> do not diversify the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, acts that differ in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> produce different effects. But the same specific effect results from a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and from an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> action: thus a man is born of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulterous</a> or of lawful wedlock. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil actions</a> do not differ in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, actions are sometimes said to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or bad from a circumstance, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). But since a circumstance is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, it does not give an action its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions do not differ in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> on account of their <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic ii. 1) "like <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> produce like actions." But a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and a bad <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> differ in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as liberality and prodigality. Therefore also <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and bad actions differ in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Every action derives its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from its object, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Hence it follows that a difference of object <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a difference of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in actions. Now, it must be observed that a difference of objects <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a difference of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in actions, according as the latter are referred to one active principle, which does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a difference in actions, according as they are referred to another active principle. Because nothing <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> constitutes a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but only that which is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a>; and a difference of object may be <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> in reference to one active principle, and <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> in reference to another. Thus to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> color and to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> sound, differ <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> in reference to sense, but not in reference to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p>Now in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> are predicated in reference to the reason; because as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv), "the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is to be in accordance with reason," and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is "to be against <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>." For that is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for a thing which suits it in regard to its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>; and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, that which is against the order of its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. It is therefore evident that the difference of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> considered in reference to the object is an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> difference in relation to reason; that is to say, according as the object is suitable or unsuitable to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Now certain actions are called <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> or moral, inasmuch as they proceed from the reason. Consequently it is evident that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> diversify the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions; since <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> differences <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a difference of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Even in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, inasmuch as something is according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and something against <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, diversify the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; for a dead body and a living body are not of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. In like manner, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, inasmuch as it is in accord with reason, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, inasmuch as it is against reason, diversify the moral <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">Evil</a> implies privation, not absolute, but affecting some <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. For an action is said to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, not because it has no object at all; but because it has an object in disaccord with reason, for instance, to appropriate another's property. Wherefore in so far as the object is something positive, it can constitute the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The conjugal act and <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, as compared to reason, differ specifically and have effects specifically different; because the other deserves praise and reward, the other, blame and punishment. But as compared to the generative power, they do not differ in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; and thus they have one specific effect.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> A circumstance is sometimes taken as the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> difference of the object, as compared to reason; and then it can specify a moral act. And it must needs be so whenever a circumstance transforms an action from <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; for a circumstance would not make an action <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, except through being repugnant to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether an action has the species of good or evil from its end?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which are from the end do not diversify the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of actions. For actions derive their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the object. But the end is altogether apart from the object. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which are from the end do not diversify the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of an action.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> does not constitute the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as stated above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>). But it is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to an action to be ordained to some particular end; for instance, to give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> from vainglory. Therefore actions are not diversified as to <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which are from the end.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, acts that differ in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, can be ordained to the same end: thus to the end of vainglory, actions of various <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> can be ordained. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which are taken from the end, do not diversify the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of action.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It has been shown above (Question 1, Article 3) that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions derive their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the end. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in respect of the end diversify the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of actions.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Certain actions are called <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, inasmuch as they are <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, as stated above (Question 1, Article 1). Now, in a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> action, there is a twofold action, viz. the interior action of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and the external action: and each of these actions has its object. The end is properly the object of the interior act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: while the object of the external action, is that on which the action is brought to bear. Therefore just as the external action takes its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the object on which it bears; so the interior act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> takes its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the end, as from its own proper object.

<p>Now that which is on the part of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is formal in regard to that which is on the part of the external action: because the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> uses the limbs to act as instruments; nor have external actions any measure of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morality</a>, save in so far as they are <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of a <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a> is considered formally with regard to the end, but materially with regard to the object of the external action. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. v, 2) that "he who steals that he may commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, is strictly speaking, more adulterer than <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The end also has the character of an object, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although it is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to the external action to be ordained to some particular end, it is not <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to the interior act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which act is compared to the external act, as form to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> When many actions, differing in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, are ordained to the same end, there is indeed a diversity of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> on the part of the external actions; but unity of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> on the part of the internal action.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the species derived from the end is contained under the species derived from the object, as under its genus, or conversely?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> derived from the end is contained under the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> derived from the object, as a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is contained under its genus; for instance, when a man commits a <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> in order to give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. For an action takes its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from its object, as stated above (2,6). But it is impossible for a thing to be contained under another <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, if this <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> be not contained under the proper <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of that thing; because the same thing cannot be contained in different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> that are not subordinate to one another. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> which is taken from the end, is contained under the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> which is taken from the object.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the last difference always constitutes the most specific <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But the difference derived from the end seems to come after the difference derived from the object: because the end is something last. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> derived from the end, is contained under the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> derived from the object, as its most specific <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the more formal a difference is compared to genus, as form to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> derived from the end, is more formal than that which is derived from the object, as stated above (<a href="#6">Article 6</a>). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> derived from the end is contained under the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> derived from the object, as the most specific <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is contained under the subaltern genus.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Each genus has its determinate differences. But an action of one same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> on the part of its object, can be ordained to an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of ends: for instance, <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> can be ordained to an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and bad ends. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> derived from the end is not contained under the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> derived from the object, as under its genus.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The object of the external act can stand in a twofold relation to the end of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: first, as being of itself ordained thereto; thus to fight well is of itself ordained to victory; secondly, as being ordained thereto <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>; thus to take what belongs to another is ordained <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> to the giving of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. Now the differences that divide a genus, and constitute the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of that genus, must, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. vii, 12), divide that genus <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>: and if they divide it <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, the division is incorrect: as, if one were to say: "Animals are divided into rational and irrational; and the irrational into animals with wings, and animals without wings"; for "winged" and "wingless" are not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> determinations of the irrational being. But the following division would be correct: "Some animals have feet, some have no feet: and of those that have feet, some have two feet, some four, some many": because the latter division is an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> determination of the former. Accordingly when the object is not of itself ordained to the end, the specific difference derived from the object is not an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> determination of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> derived from the end, nor is the reverse the case. Wherefore one of these <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is not under the other; but then the moral action is contained under two <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> that are disparate, as it were. Consequently we say that he that commits <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> for the sake of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, is guilty of a twofold <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> in one action. On the other hand, if the object be of itself ordained to the end, one of these differences is an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> determination of the other. Wherefore one of these <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> will be contained under the other.

<p>It remains to be considered which of the two is contained under the other. In order to make this clear, we must first of all observe that the more particular the form is from which a difference is taken, the more specific is the difference. Secondly, that the more universal an agent is, the more universal a form does it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Thirdly, that the more remote an end is, the more universal the agent to which it corresponds; thus victory, which is the last end of the army, is the end intended by the commander in chief; while the right ordering of this or that regiment is the end intended by one of the lower officers. From all this it follows that the specific difference derived from the end, is more general; and that the difference derived from an object which of itself is ordained to that end, is a specific difference in relation to the former. For the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, the proper object of which is the end, is the universal mover in respect of all the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the proper objects of which are the objects of their particular acts.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> One and the same thing, considered in its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, cannot be in two <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, one of which is not subordinate to the other. But in respect of those things which are superadded to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, one thing can be contained under different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Thus one and the same fruit, as to its color, is contained under one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, i.e. a white thing: and, as to its perfume, under the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of sweet-smelling things. In like manner an action which, as to its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, is in one <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, considered in respect to the moral <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> that are added to it, can belong to two <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as stated above (1, 3, ad 3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The end is last in execution; but first in the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the reason, in regard to which moral actions receive their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Difference is compared to genus as form to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, inasmuch as it actualizes the genus. On the other hand, the genus is considered as more formal than the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, inasmuch as it is something more absolute and less contracted. Wherefore also the parts of a definition are reduced to the genus of <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">formal</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as is stated in Phys. ii, 3. And in this sense the genus is the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">formal</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; and so much the more formal, as it is more universal.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether any action is indifferent in its species?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that no action is indifferent in its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. For <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is the privation of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Enchiridion xi). But privation and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> are immediate contraries, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Categor. viii). Therefore there is not such thing as an action that is indifferent in its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as though it were between <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions derive their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from their end or object, as stated above (06; 1, 3). But every end and every object is either <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or bad. Therefore every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> action is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> according to its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. None, therefore, is indifferent in its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), an action is said to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, when it has its due complement of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>; and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, when it lacks that complement. But every action must needs either have the entire plenitude of its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, or lack it in some respect. Therefore every action must needs be either <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or bad in its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and none is indifferent.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 18) that "there are certain <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of a middle kind, which can be done with a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> mind, of which it is rash to form a judgment." Therefore some actions are indifferent according to their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (2,5), every action takes its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from its object; while <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> action, which is called moral, takes its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the object, in relation to the principle of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions, which is the reason. Wherefore if the object of an action includes something in accord with the order of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, it will be a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> action according to its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; for instance, to give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in want. On the other hand, if it includes something repugnant to the order of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, it will be an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> act according to its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; for instance, to steal, which is to appropriate what belongs to another. But it may happen that the object of an action does not include something pertaining to the order of reason; for instance, to pick up a straw from the ground, to walk in the fields, and the like: and such actions are indifferent according to their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Privation is twofold. One is privation "as a result" [privatum esse], and this leaves nothing, but takes all away: thus blindness takes away sight altogether; darkness, light; and death, life. Between this privation and the contrary <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, there can be no medium in respect of the proper subject. The other is privation "in process" [privari]: thus sickness is privation of health; not that it takes health away altogether, but that it is a kind of road to the entire loss of health, occasioned by death. And since this sort of privation leaves something, it is not always the immediate contrary of the opposite <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. In this way <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is a privation of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as Simplicius says in his commentary on the Categories: because it does not take away all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but leaves some. Consequently there can be something between <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Every object or end has some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, at least <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to it: but this does not imply moral <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, which is considered in relation to the reason, as stated above. And it is of this that we are here treating.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Not everything belonging to an action belongs also to its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Wherefore although an action's specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> may not contain all that belongs to the full complement of its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, it is not therefore an action specifically bad; nor is it specifically <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Thus a man in regard to his <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is neither <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> nor <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether an individual action can be indifferent?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> action can be indifferent. For there is no <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> that does not, cannot, contain an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. But an action can be indifferent in its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as stated above (<a href="#8">Article 8</a>). Therefore an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> action can be indifferent.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> actions <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> like <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, as stated in Ethic. ii, 1. But a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> can be indifferent: for the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 1) that those who are of an even temper and prodigal disposition are not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; and yet it is evident that they are not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since they depart from <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and thus they are indifferent in respect of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. Therefore some <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> actions are indifferent.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, moral <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, while moral <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. But it happens sometimes that a man fails to ordain a specifically indifferent action to a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> or <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> end. Therefore an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> action may happen to be indifferent.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says in a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> (vi in Evang.): "An idle word is one that lacks either the usefulness of rectitude or the motive of just <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> or pious utility." But an idle word is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, because "men . . . shall render an account of it in the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">day of judgment</a>" (<a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse36">Matthew 12:36</a>): while if it does not lack the motive of just <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> or pious utility, it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore every word is either <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or bad. For the same reason every other action is either <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or bad. Therefore no <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> action is indifferent.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It sometimes happens that an action is indifferent in its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but considered in the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And the reason of this is because a moral action, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), derives its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> not only from its object, whence it takes its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; but also from the circumstances, which are its <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, as it were; just as something belongs to a man by reason of his <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, which does not belong to him by reason of his <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. And every <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> action must needs have some circumstance that makes it <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or bad, at least in respect of the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the end. For since it belongs to the reason to direct; if an action that proceeds from deliberate reason be not directed to the due end, it is, by that fact alone, repugnant to reason, and has the character of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But if it be directed to a due end, it is in accord with reason; wherefore it has the character of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now it must needs be either directed or not directed to a due end. Consequently every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> action that proceeds from deliberate reason, if it be considered in the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, must be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or bad.

<p>If, however, it does not proceed from deliberate reason, but from some act of the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, as when a man strokes his beard, or moves his hand or foot; such an action, properly speaking, is not moral or <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>; since this depends on the reason. Hence it will be indifferent, as standing apart from the genus of moral actions.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> For an action to be indifferent in its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> can be understood in several ways. First in such a way that its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> demands that it remain indifferent; and the objection proceeds along this line. But no action can be specifically indifferent thus: since no object of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> action is such that it cannot be directed to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, either through its end or through a circumstance. Secondly, specific indifference of an action may be due to the fact that as far as its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is concerned, it is neither <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> nor bad. Wherefore it can be made <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or bad by something else. Thus <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as far as his <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is concerned, is neither white nor black; nor is it a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of his <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> that he should not be black or white; but blackness or whiteness is superadded to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by other principles than those of his <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states that a man is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, properly speaking, if he be hurtful to others. And accordingly, because he hurts none save himself. And the same applies to all others who are not hurtful to other men. But we say here that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, in general, is all that is repugnant to right reason. And in this sense every <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> action is either <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or bad, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Whenever an end is intended by deliberate reason, it belongs either to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of some <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, or to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of some <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. Thus, if a man's action is directed to the support or repose of his body, it is also directed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, provided he direct his body itself to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. The same clearly applies to other actions.

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether a circumstance places a moral action in the species of good or evil?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a circumstance cannot place a moral action in the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of an action is taken from its object. But circumstances differ from the object. Therefore circumstances do not give an action its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, circumstances are as <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> in relation to the moral action, as stated above (Question 7, Article 1). But an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> does not constitute the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Therefore a circumstance does not constitute a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, one thing is not in several <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But one action has several circumstances. Therefore a circumstance does not place a moral action in a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Place is a circumstance. But place makes a moral action to be in a certain <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; for <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> of a thing from a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place is a <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a>. Therefore a circumstance makes a moral action to be specifically <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or bad.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Just as the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things are constituted by their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> forms, so the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of moral actions are constituted by forms as conceived by the reason, as is evident from what was said above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>). But since <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is determinate to one thing, nor can a process of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> go on to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>, there must needs be some ultimate form, giving a specific difference, after which no further specific difference is possible. Hence it is that in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things, that which is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to a thing, cannot be taken as a difference constituting the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But the process of reason is not fixed to one particular term, for at any point it can still proceed further. And consequently that which, in one action, is taken as a circumstance added to the object that specifies the action, can again be taken by the directing reason, as the principal <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the object that determines the action's <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Thus to appropriate another's property is specified by reason of the property being "another's," and in this respect it is placed in the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>; and if we consider that action also in its bearing on place or time, then this will be an additional circumstance. But since the reason can direct as to place, time, and the like, it may happen that the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> as to place, in relation to the object, is considered as being in disaccord with reason: for instance, reason forbids damage to be done to a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place. Consequently to steal from a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place has an additional repugnance to the order of reason. And thus place, which was first of all considered as a circumstance, is considered here as the principal <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the object, and as itself repugnant to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. And in this way, whenever a circumstance has a special relation to reason, either for or against, it must needs specify the moral action whether <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or bad.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A circumstance, in so far as it specifies an action, is considered as a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the object, as stated above, and as being, as it were, a specific difference thereof.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A circumstance, so long as it is but a circumstance, does not specify an action, since thus it is a mere <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>: but when it becomes a principal <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the object, then it does specify the action.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is not every circumstance that places the moral action in the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; since not every circumstance implies accord or disaccord with reason. Consequently, although one action may have many circumstances, it does not follow that it is in many <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Nevertheless there is no reason why one action should not be in several, even disparate, moral <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as said above (07, ad 1; 1, 3, ad 3).

<h2 id="article11">Article 11. Whether every circumstance that makes an action better or worse, places a moral action in a species of good or evil?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that every circumstance relating to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, specifies an action. For <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> are specific differences of moral actions. Therefore that which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a difference in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of a moral action, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a specific difference, which is the same as to make it differ in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Now that which makes an action better or worse, makes it differ in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>. Therefore it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> it to differ in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Therefore every circumstance that makes an action better or worse, constitutes a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, an additional circumstance either has in itself the character of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, or it has not. If not, it cannot make the action better or worse; because what is not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, cannot make a greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and what is not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, cannot make a greater <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But if it has in itself the character of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, for this very reason it has a certain <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore every circumstance that makes an action better or worse, constitutes a new <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. iv), "<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by each single defect." Now every circumstance that increases <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, has a special defect. Therefore every such circumstance adds a new <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And for the same reason, every circumstance that increases <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, seems to add a new <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>: just as every unity added to a number makes a new <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of number; since the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> consists in "number, weight, and measure" (I, 5, 5).

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> More and less do not change a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But more and less is a circumstance of additional <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>. Therefore not every circumstance that makes a moral action better or worse, places it in a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#10">Article 10</a>), a circumstance gives the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to a moral action, in so far as it regards a special order of reason. Now it happens sometimes that a circumstance does not regard a special order of reason in respect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, except on the supposition of another previous circumstance, from which the moral action takes its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Thus to take something in a large or small <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, does not regard the order of reason in respect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, except a certain other <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> be presupposed, from which the action takes its <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> or <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>; for instance, if what is taken belongs to another, which makes the action to be discordant with reason. Wherefore to take what belongs to another in a large or small <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, does not change the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Nevertheless it can aggravate or diminish the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. The same applies to other <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> or <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> actions. Consequently not every circumstance that makes a moral action better or worse, changes its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In things which can be more or less intense, the difference of more or less does not change the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>: thus by differing in whiteness through being more or less white a thing is not changed in regard to its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of color. In like manner that which makes an action to be more or less <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, does not make the action differ in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A circumstance that aggravates a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or adds to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of an action, sometimes has no <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> in itself, but in regard to some other <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the action, as stated above. Consequently it does not add a new <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but adds to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> derived from this other <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the action.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A circumstance does not always involve a distinct defect of its own; sometimes it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a defect in reference to something else. In like manner a circumstance does not always add further perfection, except in reference to something else. And, for as much as it does, although it may add to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, it does not always change the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.
