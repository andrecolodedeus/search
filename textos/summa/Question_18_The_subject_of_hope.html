<h1>Question 18. The subject of hope</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3018.htm#article1"> Is the virtue of hope in the will as its subject?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3018.htm#article2"> Is it in the blessed?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3018.htm#article3"> Is it in the damned?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3018.htm#article4"> Is there certainty in the hope of the wayfarer?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether hope is in the will as its subject?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that hope is not in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as its subject. For the object of hope is an arduous <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as stated above (17, 1; I-II, 40, 1). Now the arduous is the object, not of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, but of the irascible. Therefore hope is not in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> but in the irascible.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, where one suffices it is superfluous to add another. Now <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> suffices for the perfecting of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which is the most perfect of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Therefore hope is not in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the one same power cannot exercise two acts at the same time; thus the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> cannot understand many things simultaneously. Now the act of hope can be at the same time as an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Since, then, the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> evidently belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, it follows that the act of hope does not belong to that power: so that, therefore, hope is not in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not apprehensive of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> save as regards the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> in which is <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> declares (De Trin. xiv, 3,6). Now hope is a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> having <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for its object. Since therefore it is neither in the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, nor in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which belong to the cognitive faculty, it follows that it is in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as its subject.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As shown above (I, 87, 2), <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by their acts. Now the act of hope is a movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> faculty, since its object is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. And, since there is a twofold <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, namely, the sensitive which is divided into irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, called the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as stated in I, 82, 5, those movements which occur in the lower <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, are with passion, while those in the higher <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> are without passion, as shown above (I, 87, 2, ad 1; I-II, 22, 3, ad 3). Now the act of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of hope cannot belong to the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is the principal object of this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, is not a sensible but a Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore hope resides in the higher <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> called the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and not in the lower <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, of which the irascible is a part.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The object of the irascible is an arduous sensible: whereas the object of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of hope is an arduous intelligible, or rather superintelligible.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> perfects the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> sufficiently with regard to one act, which is the act of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a>: but another <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is required in order to perfect it with regard to its other act, which is that of hoping.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The movement of hope and the movement of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> are mutually related, as was shown above (Question 17, Article 8). Hence there is no reason why both movements should not belong at the same time to the same power: even as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can understand many things at the same time if they be related to one another, as stated in I, 85, 4.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether in the blessed there is hope?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in the blessed there is hope. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was a perfect comprehensor from the first moment of His conception. Now He had hope, since, according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a>, the words of <a href="../bible/psa030.htm#verse2">Psalm 30:2</a>, "In Thee, O Lord, have I hoped," are said in His <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Therefore in the blessed there can be hope.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, even as the obtaining of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is an arduous <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, so is its continuation. Now, before they obtain <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, men hope to obtain it. Therefore, after they have obtained it, they can hope to continue in its possession.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, by the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of hope, a man can hope for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, not only for himself, but also for others, as stated above (Question 17, Article 3). But the blessed who are in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> hope for the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of others, else they would not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for them. Therefore there can be hope in them.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> implies not only <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> but also <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the body. Now the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, look yet for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of their bodies (<a href="../bible/rev006.htm#verse10">Apocalypse 6:10</a>; <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, Gen. ad lit. xii, 35). Therefore in the blessed there can be hope.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse24">Romans 8:24</a>): "What a man seeth, why doth he hope for?" Now the blessed enjoy the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore hope has no place in them.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> If what gives a thing its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> be removed, the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is destroyed, and that thing cannot remain the same; just as when a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> body loses its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, it does not remain the same specifically. Now hope takes its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from its principal object, even as the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> do, as was shown above (17, 5,6; I-II, 54, 2): and its principal object is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> as being possible to obtain by the assistance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated above (Question 17, Article 2).

<p>Since then the arduous possible <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> cannot be an object of hope except in so far as it is something future, it follows that when <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is no longer future, but present, it is incompatible with the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of hope. Consequently hope, like <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, is voided in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and neither of them can be in the blessed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was a comprehensor and therefore blessed as to the enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nevertheless He was, at the same time, a wayfarer, as regards the passibility of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, to which He was still subject. Hence it was possible for Him to hope for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of impassibility and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, yet not so as to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of hope, the principal object of which is not the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the body but the enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> is called <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, because through enjoying <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> they become partakers, as it were, of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> which surpasses all time: so that the continuation of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> does not differ in respect of present, past and future. Hence the blessed do not hope for the continuation of their <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> (for as regards this there is no future), but are in actual possession thereof.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> So long as the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of hope lasts, it is by the same hope that one hopes for one's own <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, and for that of others. But when hope is voided in the blessed, whereby they hoped for their own <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, they hope for the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of others indeed, yet not by the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of hope, but rather by the love of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Even so, he that has Divine <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, by that same <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> loves his neighbor, without having the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, but by some other love.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Since hope is a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> having <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for its object, its principal object is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which consists in the enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the body. Moreover, although the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the body is something arduous in comparison with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, yet it is not so for one who has the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; both because the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the body is a very small thing as compared with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and because one who has the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has already the sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the body.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether hope is in the damned?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is hope in the damned. For the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is damned and prince of the damned, according to <a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse41">Matthew 25:41</a>: "Depart . . . you <a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">cursed</a>, into everlasting fire, which was prepared for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> has hope, according to <a href="../bible/job040.htm#verse28">Job 40:28</a>, "Behold his hope shall fail him." Therefore it seems that the damned have hope.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is either living or dead, so is hope. But lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> can be in the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">devils</a> and the damned, according to <a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse19">James 2:19</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">devils</a> . . . <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and tremble." Therefore it seems that lifeless hope also can be in the damned.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, after death there accrues to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> no <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> or demerit that he had not before, according to <a href="../bible/ecc011.htm#verse3">Ecclesiastes 11:3</a>, "If the tree fall to the south, or to the north, in what place soever it shall fall, there shall it be." Now many who are damned, in this life hoped and never despaired. Therefore they will hope in the future life also.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Hope <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse12">Romans 12:12</a>, "Rejoicing in hope." Now the damned have no <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, but sorrow and grief, according to <a href="../bible/isa065.htm#verse14">Isaiah 65:14</a>, "My servants shall praise for joyfulness of heart, and you shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for grief of spirit." Therefore no hope is in the damned.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Just as it is a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> should find rest therein, so is it a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of punishment, that what is inflicted in punishment, should go against the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Now that which is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> can neither be restful nor repugnant to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xi, 17) that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> could not be perfectly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> in their first state before their confirmation, or unhappy before their fall, since they had no foreknowledge of what would happen to them. For perfect and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> requires that one should be certain of being <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> for ever, else the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> would not rest.

<p>In like manner, since the everlastingness of damnation is a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the punishment of the damned, it would not be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> penal unless it went against the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; and this would be impossible if they were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the everlastingness of their damnation. Hence it belongs to the unhappy state of the damned, that they should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they cannot by any means escape from damnation and obtain <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/job015.htm#verse22">Job 15:22</a>): "He <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> not that he may return from darkness to light." It is, therefore, evident that they cannot apprehend <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> as a possible <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as neither can the blessed apprehend it as a future <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Consequently there is no hope either in the blessed or in the damned. On the other hand, hope can be in wayfarers, whether of this life or in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>, because in either case they apprehend <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> as a future possible thing.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxiii, 20) this is said of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> as regards his members, whose hope will fail utterly: or, if it be understood of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> himself, it may refer to the hope whereby he expects to vanquish the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, in which sense we read just before (<a href="../bible/job040.htm#verse18">Job 40:18</a>): "He trusteth that the Jordan may run into his mouth": this is not, however, the hope of which we are speaking.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion viii), "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is about things, bad or <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, past, present, or future, one's own or another's; whereas hope is only about <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, future and concerning oneself." Hence it is possible for lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to be in the damned, but not hope, since the Divine goods are not for them future possible things, but far removed from them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Lack of hope in the damned does not change their demerit, as neither does the voiding of hope in the blessed increase their <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>: but both these things are due to the change in their respective states.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether there is certainty in the hope of a wayfarer?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is no <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> in the hope of a wayfarer. For hope resides in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. But <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> pertains not to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> but to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore there is no <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> in hope.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, hope is based on <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, as stated above (Question 17, Article 1). Now it is impossible in this life to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> for certain that we are in a state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a>, as stated above (I-II, 112, 5). Therefore there is no <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> in the hope of a wayfarer.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, there can be no <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> about that which may fail. Now many a hopeful wayfarer fails to obtain <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Therefore wayfarer's hope has no <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> "Hope is the certain expectation of future <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>," as the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> states (Sent. iii, D, 26): and this may be gathered from <a href="../bible/2ti001.htm#verse12">2 Timothy 1:12</a>, "I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Whom I have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and I am certain that He is able to keep that which I have committed to Him."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Certainty is found in a thing in two ways, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> and by participation. It is found <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> in the cognitive power; by participation in whatever is moved infallibly to its end by the cognitive power. On this way we say that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> works with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>, since it is moved by the Divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> which moves everything with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> to its end. On this way too, the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are said to work with greater <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> than art, in as much as, like a second <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, they are moved to their acts by the reason: and thus too, hope tends to its end with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>, as though sharing in the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is in the cognitive faculty.

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Hope does not trust chiefly in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> already received, but on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> omnipotence and mercy, whereby even he that has not <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, can obtain it, so as to come to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>. Now whoever has <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> omnipotence and mercy.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> That some who have hope fail to obtain <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, is due to a fault of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> in placing the obstacle of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but not to any deficiency in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> power or mercy, in which hope places its trust. Hence this does not prejudice the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of hope.
