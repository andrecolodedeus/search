<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether God can be feared?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be feared. For the object of fear is a future <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as stated above (I-II, 41, 2,3). But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is free of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, since He is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> itself. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be feared.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, fear is opposed to hope. Now we hope in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore we cannot fear Him at the same time.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Rhet. ii, 5), "we fear those things whence <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> comes to us." But <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> comes to us, not from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but from ourselves, according to <a href="../bible/hos013.htm#verse9">Hosea 13:9</a>: "Destruction is thy own, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: thy help is . . . in Me." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not to be feared.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/jer010.htm#verse7">Jeremiah 10:7</a>): "Who shall not fear Thee, O King of <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>?" and (<a href="../bible/mal001.htm#verse6">Malachi 1:6</a>): "If I be a master, where is My fear?"

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Just as hope has two objects, one of which is the future <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> itself, that one expects to obtain, while the other is someone's help, through whom one expects to obtain what one hopes for, so, too, fear may have two objects, one of which is the very <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which a man shrinks from, while the other is that from which the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> may come. Accordingly, in the first way <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> itself, cannot be an object of fear; but He can be an object of fear in the second way, in so far as there may come to us some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> either from Him or in relation to Him.

<p>From Him there comes the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of punishment, but this is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> not absolutely but relatively, and, absolutely speaking, is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Because, since a thing is said to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> through being ordered to an end, while <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> implies lack of this order, that which excludes the order to the last end is altogether <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and such is the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of fault. On the other hand the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of punishment is indeed an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, in so far as it is the privation of some particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, yet absolutely speaking, it is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, in so far as it is ordained to the last end.

<p>In relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of fault can come to us, if we be separated from Him: and in this way <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can and ought to be feared.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This objection considers the object of fear as being the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which a man shuns.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we may consider both His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, in respect of which He punishes those who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and His mercy, in respect of which He sets us free: in us the consideration of His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> gives rise to fear, but the consideration of His mercy gives rise to <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, so that, accordingly, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the object of both hope and fear, but under different aspects.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of fault is not from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as its author but from us, in for far as we forsake <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: while the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of punishment is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as its author, in so far as it has character of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since it is something <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, through being inflicted on us <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>; although originally this is due to the demerit of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: thus it is written (<a href="../bible/wis001.htm#verse13">Wisdom 1:13-16</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made not death . . . but the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> with works and words have called it to them."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether fear is fittingly divided into filial, initial, servile and worldly fear?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that fear is unfittingly divided into filial, initial, servile and worldly fear. For <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 15) that there are six kinds of fear, viz. "laziness, shamefacedness," etc. of which we have treated above (I-II, 41, 4), and which are not mentioned in the division in question. Therefore this division of fear seems unfitting.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, each of these <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> is either <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But there is a fear, viz. <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> fear, which is neither morally <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since it is in the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, according to <a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse19">James 2:19</a>, "The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">devils</a> . . . <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and tremble," nor <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, since it is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mar014.htm#verse33">Mark 14:33</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> "began to fear and be heavy." Therefore the aforesaid division of fear is insufficient.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the relation of son to father differs from that of wife to husband, and this again from that of servant to master. Now filial fear, which is that of the son in comparison with his father, is distinct from servile fear, which is that of the servant in comparison with his master. Therefore chaste fear, which seems to be that of the wife in comparison with her husband, ought to be distinguished from all these other <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, even as servile fear <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> punishment, so do initial and worldly fear. Therefore no distinction should be made between them.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, even as <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is about some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, so is fear about some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Now "<a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the eyes," which is the desire for things of this world, is distinct from "<a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the flesh," which is the desire for one's own pleasure. Therefore "worldly fear," whereby one <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> to lose external goods, is distinct from "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> fear," whereby one <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> harm to one's own <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary</strong> stands the authority of the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> (Sent. iii, D, 34).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We are speaking of fear now, in so far as it makes us turn, so to speak, to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or away from Him. For, since the object of fear is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, sometimes, on account of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> he <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> withdraws from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and this is called <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> fear; while sometimes, on account of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> he <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a>, he turns to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and adheres to Him. This latter <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is twofold, viz. <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of punishment, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of fault.

<p>Accordingly if a man turn to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and adhere to Him, through fear of punishment, it will be servile fear; but if it be on account of fear of committing a fault, it will be filial fear, for it becomes a child to fear offending its father. If, however, it be on account of both, it will be initial fear, which is between both these <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a>. As to whether it is possible to fear the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of fault, the question has been treated above (I-II, 42, 3) when we were considering the passion of fear.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> divides fear as a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: whereas this division of fear is taken from its relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as explained above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Moral <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> consists chiefly in turning to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while moral <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> consists chiefly in turning away from Him: wherefore all the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> mentioned above imply either moral <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> or moral <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> fear is presupposed to moral <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and so it is not numbered among these kinds of fear.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The relation of servant to master is based on the power which the master exercises over the servant; whereas, on the contrary, the relation of a son to his father or of a wife to her husband is based on the son's affection towards his father to whom he submits himself, or on the wife's affection towards her husband to whom she binds herself in the union of love. Hence filial and chaste fear amount to the same, because by the love of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> becomes our Father, according to <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse15">Romans 8:15</a>, "You have received the spirit of adoption of sons, whereby we cry: <a href="../cathen/01006d.htm">Abba</a> [Father]"; and by this same <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> He is called our spouse, according to <a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse2">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>, "I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>": whereas servile fear has no connection with these, since it does not include <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> in its definition.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> These three <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> regard punishment but in different ways. For worldly or <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> fear regards a punishment which turns <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> enemies sometimes inflict or threaten: whereas servile and initial fear regard a punishment whereby men are drawn to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and which is inflicted or threatened by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Servile fear regards this punishment chiefly, while initial fear regards it secondarily.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> It amounts to the same whether <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> turns away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through fear of losing his worldly goods, or through fear of forfeiting the well-being of his body, since external goods belong to the body. Hence both these <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> are reckoned as one here, although they fear different <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, even as they correspond to the desire of different goods. This diversity <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a specific diversity of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, all of which alike however lead <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether worldly fear is always evil?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that worldly fear is not always <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Because regard for men seems to be a kind of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> fear. Now some are blamed for having no regard for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, for instance, the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> judge of whom we read (<a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse2">Luke 18:2</a>) that he "feared not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor regarded <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." Therefore it seems that worldly fear is not always <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, worldly fear seems to have reference to the punishments inflicted by the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a>. Now such like punishments incite us to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> actions, according to <a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse3">Romans 13:3</a>, "Wilt thou not be afraid of the power? Do that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and thou shalt have praise from the same." Therefore worldly fear is not always <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it seems that what is in us <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, is not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, since our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to fear detriment to his body, and loss of his worldly goods, whereby the present life is supported. Therefore it seems that worldly fear is not always <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse28">Matthew 10:28</a>): "Fear ye not them that kill the body," thus forbidding worldly fear. Now nothing but what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is forbidden by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore worldly fear is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As shown above (I-II, 1, 3; I-II, 18, 1; I-II, 54, 2) moral acts and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> take their name and <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from their objects. Now the proper object of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite's</a> movement is the final <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: so that, in consequence, every <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> movement is both specified and named from its proper end. For if anyone were to describe <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> as love of work because men work on account of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, this description would be incorrect, since the covetous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> seeks work not as end but as a means: the end that he seeks is <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, wherefore <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is rightly described as the desire or the love of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, and this is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Accordingly worldly love is, properly speaking, the love whereby a man trusts in the world as his end, so that worldly love is always <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Now fear is born of love, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> the loss of what he loves, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (Qq. lxxxiii, qu. 33). Now worldly fear is that which arises from worldly love as from an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> root, for which reason worldly fear is always <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> One may have regard for men in two ways. First in so far as there is in them something divine, for instance, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> or of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, or at least of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and in this way those are blamed who have no regard for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Secondly, one may have regard for men as being in opposition to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and thus it is praiseworthy to have no regard for men, according as we read of Elias or Eliseus (<a href="../bible/sir048.htm#verse13">Sirach 48:13</a>): "In his days he feared not the prince."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a> inflicts punishment in order to withdraw men from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it is acting as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> minister, according to <a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse4">Romans 13:4</a>, "For he is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> minister, an avenger to execute wrath upon him that doth <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." To fear the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a> in this way is part, not of worldly fear, but of servile or initial fear.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to shrink from detriment to his own body and loss of worldly goods, but to forsake <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> on that account is contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 1) that there are certain things, viz. <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, which no fear should drive us to do, since to do such things is worse than to suffer any punishment whatever.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether servile fear is good?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that servile fear is not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. For if the use of a thing is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, the thing itself is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Now the use of servile fear is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, for according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse15">Romans 8:15</a>, "if a man do anything through fear, although the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it is not well done." Therefore servile fear is not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> grows from a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> root. Now servile fear grows from a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> root, because when <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/job003.htm#verse11">Job 3:11</a>, "Why did I not die in the womb?" <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. iv, 25): "When a man dreads the punishment which confronts him for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and no longer loves the friendship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> which he has lost, his fear is born of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, not of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>." Therefore servile fear is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as mercenary love is opposed to the love of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, so is servile fear, apparently, opposed to chaste fear. But mercenary love is always <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore servile fear is also.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Nothing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. But servile fear is from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, since a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse15">Romans 8:15</a>, "You have not received the spirit of bondage," etc. says: "It is the one same spirit that bestows two <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a>, viz. servile and chaste fear." Therefore servile fear is not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is owing to its servility that servile fear may be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For servitude is opposed to freedom. Since, then, "what is free is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of itself" (Metaph. i, 2), a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> is one who does not act as <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of his own action, but as though moved from without. Now whoever does a thing through love, does it of himself so to speak, because it is by his own inclination that he is moved to act: so that it is contrary to the very notion of servility that one should act from love. Consequently servile fear as such is contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: so that if servility were <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to fear, servile fear would be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> simply, even as <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> simply, because that which makes it contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> belongs to its very <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p>This servility, however, does not belong to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of servile fear, even as neither does lifelessness to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of a moral <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> or act is taken from the object. Now the object of servile fear is punishment, and it is by <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> that, either the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to which the punishment is contrary, is loved as the last end, and that consequently the punishment is feared as the greatest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, which is the case with one who is devoid of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, or that the punishment is directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as its end, and that, consequently, it is not feared as the greatest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, which is the case with one who has <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is not destroyed through its object or end being directed to a further end. Consequently servile fear is substantially <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but is servility is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This saying of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is to be applied to a man who does something through servile fear as such, so that he loves not <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> nothing but the punishment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Servile fear as to its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is not born of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, but its servility is, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is unwilling, by love, to subject his affections to the yoke of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Mercenary love is that whereby <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is loved for the sake of worldly goods, and this is, of itself, contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, so that mercenary love is always <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But servile fear, as to its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, implies merely fear of punishment, whether or not this be feared as the principal <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether servile fear is substantially the same as filial fear?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that servile fear is substantially the same as filial fear. For filial fear is to servile fear the same apparently as living <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is to lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, since the one is accompanied by mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and the other not. Now living <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are substantially the same. Therefore servile and filial fear are substantially the same.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are diversified by their objects. Now the same thing is the object of servile and of filial fear, since they both fear <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore servile and filial fear are substantially the same.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hopes to enjoy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to obtain favors from Him, so does he fear to be separated from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to be punished by Him. Now it is the same hope whereby we hope to enjoy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to receive other favors from Him, as stated above (17, 2, ad 2). Therefore filial fear, whereby we fear separation from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is the same as servile fear whereby we fear His punishments.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (In prim. canon. Joan. Tract. ix) says that there are two <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a>, one servile, another filial or chaste fear.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The proper object of fear is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And since acts and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are diversified by their objects, as shown above (I-II, 54, 2), it follows of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> that different kinds of fear correspond to different kinds of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p>Now the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of punishment, from which servile fear shrinks, differs specifically from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of fault, which filial fear shuns, as shown above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Hence it is evident that servile and filial fear are not the same substantially but differ specifically.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Living and lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> differ, not as regards the object, since each of them <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but in respect of something extrinsic, viz. the presence or absence of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and so they do not differ substantially. On the other hand, servile and filial fear differ as to their objects: and hence the comparison fails.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Servile fear and filial fear do not regard <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the same light. For servile fear looks upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the infliction of punishment, whereas filial fear looks upon Him, not as the active <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of guilt, but rather as the term wherefrom it shrinks to be separated by guilt. Consequently the identity of object, viz. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> a specific identity of fear, since also <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> movements differ specifically according to their different relationships to some one term, for movement from whiteness is not specifically the same as movement towards whiteness.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Hope looks upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the principle not only of the enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but also of any other favor whatever. This cannot be said of fear; and so there is no comparison.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether servile fear remains with charity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that servile fear does not remain with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (In prim. canon. Joan. Tract. ix) that "when <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> takes up its abode, it drives away fear which had prepared a place for it."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is poured forth in our hearts, by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, Who is given to us" (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans 5:5</a>). Now "where the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> is, there is liberty" (<a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse17">2 Corinthians 3:17</a>). Since then freedom excludes servitude, it seems that servile fear is driven away when <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> comes.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, servile fear is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by self-love, in so far as punishment diminishes one's own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> drives away self-love, for it makes us despise ourselves: thus <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> testifies (De Civ. Dei xiv, 28) that "the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> unto the contempt of self builds up the city of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore it seems that servile fear is driven out when <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> comes.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Servile fear is a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>). Now the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are not forfeited through the advent of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, whereby the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> dwells in us. Therefore servile fear is not driven out when <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> comes.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Servile fear proceeds from self-love, because it is fear of punishment which is detrimental to one's own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Hence the fear of punishment is consistent with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, in the same way as self-love is: because it comes to the same that a man love his own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and that he fear to be deprived of it.

<p>Now self-love may stand in a threefold relationship to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. On one way it is contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, when a man places his end in the love of his own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. On another way it is included in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, when a man loves himself for the sake of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. On a third way, it is indeed distinct from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, but is not contrary thereto, as when a man loves himself from the point of view of his own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, yet not so as to place his end in this his own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: even as one may have another special love for one's neighbor, besides the love of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> which is founded on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when we love him by reason of usefulness, <a href="../cathen/04264a.htm">consanguinity</a>, or some other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> consideration, which, however, is referable to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p>Accordingly fear of punishment is, in one way, included in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, because separation from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a punishment, which <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> shuns exceedingly; so that this belongs to chaste fear. On another way, it is contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, when a man shrinks from the punishment that is opposed to his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as being the principal <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which he loves as an end; and in this way fear of punishment is not consistent with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. On another way fear of punishment is indeed substantially distinct from chaste fear, when, to wit, a man <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> a penal <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, not because it separates him from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but because it is hurtful to his own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and yet he does not place his end in this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, so that neither does he dread this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as being the principal <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Such fear of punishment is consistent with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; but it is not called servile, except when punishment is dreaded as a principal <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as explained above (A2,4). Hence fear considered as servile, does not remain with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of servile fear can remain with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, even as self-love can remain with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is speaking of fear considered as servile: and such is the sense of the two other objections.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether fear is the beginning of wisdom?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that fear is not the beginning of wisdom. For the beginning of a thing is a part thereof. But fear is not a part of wisdom, since fear is seated in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> faculty, while wisdom is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore it seems that fear is not the beginning of wisdom.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, nothing is the beginning of itself. "Now fear of the Lord, that is wisdom," according to <a href="../bible/job028.htm#verse28">Job 28:28</a>. Therefore it seems that fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the beginning of wisdom.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, nothing is prior to the beginning. But something is prior to fear, since <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> precedes fear. Therefore it seems that fear is not the beginning of wisdom.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written in the <a href="../bible/psa110.htm#verse10">Psalm 110:10</a>: "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing may be called the beginning of wisdom in two ways: in one way because it is the beginning of wisdom itself as to its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; in another way, as to its effect. Thus the beginning of an art as to its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> consists in the principles from which that art proceeds, while the beginning of an art as to its effect is that wherefrom it begins to operate: for instance we might say that the beginning of the art of building is the foundation because that is where the builder begins his work.

<p>Now, since wisdom is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Divine things, as we shall state further on (45, 1), it is considered by us in one way, and in another way by <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>. For, seeing that our life is ordained to the enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and is directed thereto according to a participation of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, conferred on us through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, wisdom, as we look at it, is considered not only as being cognizant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as it is with the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, but also as directing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> conduct; since this is directed not only by the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, but also by the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> shows (De Trin. xii, 14). Accordingly the beginning of wisdom as to its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> consists in the first principles of wisdom, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a>, and in this sense <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is said to be the beginning of wisdom. But as regards the effect, the beginning of wisdom is the point where wisdom begins to work, and in this way fear is the beginning of wisdom, yet servile fear in one way, and filial fear, in another. For servile fear is like a principle disposing a man to wisdom from without, in so far as he refrains from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through fear of punishment, and is thus fashioned for the effect of wisdom, according to <a href="../bible/sir001.htm#verse27">Sirach 1:27</a>, "The fear of the Lord driveth out <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." On the other hand, chaste or filial fear is the beginning of wisdom, as being the first effect of wisdom. For since the regulation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> conduct by the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> belongs to wisdom, in order to make a beginning, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> must first of all fear <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and submit himself to Him: for the result will be that in all things he will be ruled by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument proves that fear is not the beginning of wisdom as to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of wisdom.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is compared to a man's whole life that is ruled by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> wisdom, as the root to the tree: hence it is written (<a href="../bible/sir001.htm#verse25">Sirach 1:25</a>): "The root of wisdom is to fear the Lord, for [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'and'] the branches thereof are longlived." Consequently, as the root is said to be virtually the tree, so the fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said to be wisdom.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the beginning of wisdom in one way, and fear, in another. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/sir025.htm#verse16">Sirach 25:16</a>): "The fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the beginning of love: and the beginning of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is to be fast joined to it."

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether initial fear differs substantially from filial fear?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that initial fear differs substantially from filial fear. For filial fear is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by love. Now initial fear is the beginning of love, according to <a href="../bible/sir025.htm#verse16">Sirach 25:16</a>, "The fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the beginning of love." Therefore initial fear is distinct from filial fear.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, initial fear dreads punishment, which is the object of servile fear, so that initial and servile fear would seem to be the same.

<p>But servile fear is distinct from filial fear. Therefore initial fear also is substantially distinct from initial fear.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a mean differs in the same ratio from both the extremes. Now initial fear is the mean between servile and filial fear. Therefore it differs from both filial and servile fear.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Perfect and imperfect do not diversify the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of a thing. Now initial and filial fear differ in respect of perfection and imperfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (In prim. canon. Joan. Tract. ix). Therefore initial fear does not differ substantially from filial fear.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Initial fear is so called because it is a beginning [initium]. Since, however, both servile and filial fear are, in some way, the beginning of wisdom, each may be called in some way, initial.

<p>It is not in this sense, however, that we are to understand initial fear in so far as it is distinct from servile and filial fear, but in the sense according to which it belongs to the state of beginners, in whom there is a beginning of filial fear resulting from a beginning of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, although they do not possess the perfection of filial fear, because they have not yet attained to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Consequently initial fear stands in the same relation to filial fear as imperfect to perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Now perfect and imperfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> differ, not as to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> but as to state. Therefore we must conclude that initial fear, as we understand it here, does not differ <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> from filial fear.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The fear which is a beginning of love is servile fear, which is the herald of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, just as the bristle introduces the thread, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (Tract. ix in Ep. i Joan.). Or else, if it be referred to initial fear, this is said to be the beginning of love, not absolutely, but relatively to the state of perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Initial fear does not dread punishment as its proper object, but as having something of servile fear connected with it: for this servile fear, as to its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, remains indeed, with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, its servility being cast aside; whereas its act remains with imperfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who is moved to perform <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> actions not only through love of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but also through fear of punishment, though this same act ceases in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who has perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which "casteth out fear," according to <a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse18">1 John 4:18</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Initial fear is a mean between servile and filial fear, not as between two things of the same genus, but as the imperfect is a mean between a perfect being and a non-being, as stated in Metaph. ii, for it is the same substantially as the perfect being, while it differs altogether from non-being.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether fear is a gift of the Holy Ghost?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that fear is not a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. For no <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is opposed to a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which is also from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; else the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> would be in opposition to Himself. Now fear is opposed to <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, which is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore fear is not a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is proper to a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to have <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for its object. But fear has <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for its object, in so far as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is feared. Therefore fear is not a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, but a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, fear arises from love. But love is reckoned a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore fear also is a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, being connected with the same <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as it were.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. ii, 49) that "fear is bestowed as a remedy against <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is opposed to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. Therefore again, fear is a kind of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are more perfect than the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, since they are bestowed in support of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. ii, 49). Now hope is more perfect than fear, since hope regards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, while fear regards <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Since, then, hope is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, it should not be said that fear is a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The fear of the Lord is numbered among the seven <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> (<a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse3">Isaiah 11:3</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Fear is of several kinds, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Now it is not "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> fear," according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Gratia et Lib. Arb. xviii), "that is a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>"--for it was by this fear that <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> denied Christ--but that fear of which it was said (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse28">Matthew 10:28</a>): "Fear Him that can destroy both <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>."

<p>Again servile fear is not to be reckoned among the seven <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, though it is from Him, because according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Nat. et Grat. lvii) it is compatible with the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: whereas the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are incompatible with the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as they are inseparable from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as stated above (I-II, 68, 5).

<p>It follows, therefore, that the fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is numbered among the seven <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, is filial or chaste fear. For it was stated above (I-II, 68, 1,3) that the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are certain <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> perfections of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> powers, whereby these are rendered amenable to the motion of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, just as, by the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> powers are rendered amenable to the motion of reason. Now for a thing to be amenable to the motion of a certain mover, the first <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> required is that it be a non-resistant subject of that mover, because resistance of the movable subject to the mover hinders the movement. This is what filial or chaste fear does, since thereby we revere <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and avoid separating ourselves from Him. Hence, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 4) filial fear holds the first place, as it were, among the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, in the ascending order, and the last place, in the descending order.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Filial fear is not opposed to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of hope: since thereby we fear, not that we may fail of what we hope to obtain by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> help, but lest we withdraw ourselves from this help. Wherefore filial fear and hope cling together, and perfect one another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The proper and principal object of fear is the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> shunned, and in this way, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be an object of fear. Yet He is, in this way, the object of hope and the other theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, since, by the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of hope, we trust in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> help, not only to obtain any other goods, but, chiefly, to obtain <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, as the principal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. The same evidently applies to the other theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> From the fact that love is the origin of fear, it does not follow that the fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not a distinct <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> which is the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since love is the origin of all the emotions, and yet we are perfected by different <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> in respect of different emotions. Yet love is more of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than fear is, because love regards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, to which <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is principally directed by reason of its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as was shown above (I-II, 55, 3,4); for which reason hope is also reckoned as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; whereas fear principally regards <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, the avoidance of which it denotes, wherefore it is something less than a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> According to <a href="../bible/sir010.htm#verse14">Sirach 10:14</a>, "the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is to fall off from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," that is to refuse submission to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and this is opposed to filial fear, which reveres <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Thus fear cuts off the source of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> for which reason it is bestowed as a remedy against <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. Yet it does not follow that it is the same as the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, but that it is its origin. For the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are the origin of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as stated above (I-II, 68, 4), while the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are the origin of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, as stated above (I-II, 69, 4, ad 3).

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the Fifth Objection.

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether fear decreases when charity increases?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that fear decreases when <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> increases. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (In prim. canon. Joan. Tract. ix): "The more <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> increases, the more fear decreases."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, fear decreases when hope increases. But <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> increases when hope increases, as stated above (Question 17, Article 8). Therefore fear decreases when <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> increases.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, love implies union, whereas fear implies separation. Now separation decreases when union increases. Therefore fear decreases when the love of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> increases.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Qq. lxxxiii, qu. 36) that "the fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> not only begins but also perfects wisdom, whereby we love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> above all things, and our neighbor as ourselves."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Fear is twofold, as stated above (A2,4); one is filial fear, whereby a son <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> to offend his father or to be separated from him; the other is servile fear, whereby one <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> punishment.

<p>Now filial fear must needs increase when <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> increases, even as an effect increases with the increase of its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. For the more one loves a man, the more one <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> to offend him and to be separated from him.

<p>On the other hand servile fear, as regards its servility, is entirely cast out when <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> comes, although the fear of punishment remains as to its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, as stated above (<a href="#6">Article 6</a>). This fear decreases as <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> increases, chiefly as regards its act, since the more a man loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the less he <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> punishment; first, because he thinks less of his own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, to which punishment is opposed; secondly, because, the faster he clings, the more confident he is of the reward, and, consequently the less fearful of punishment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> speaks there of the fear of punishment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is fear of punishment that decreases when hope increases; but with the increase of the latter filial fear increases, because the more certainly a man expects to obtain a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by another's help, the more he <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> to offend him or to be separated from him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Filial fear does not imply separation from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but submission to Him, and shuns separation from that submission. Yet, in a way, it implies separation, in the point of not presuming to equal oneself to Him, and of submitting to Him, which separation is to be observed even in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, in so far as a man loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more than himself and more than aught else. Hence the increase of the love of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> implies not a decrease but an increase in the reverence of fear.

<h2 id="article11">Article 11. Whether fear remains in heaven?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that fear does not remain in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/pro001.htm#verse33">Proverbs 1:33</a>): "He . . . shall enjoy abundance, without fear of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>," which is to be understood as referring to those who already enjoy wisdom in everlasting <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Now every fear is about some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, since <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is the object of fear, as stated above (A2,5; I-II, 42, 1). Therefore there will be no fear in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> men will be conformed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse2">1 John 3:2</a>, "When He shall appear, we shall be like to Him." But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> nothing. Therefore, in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, men will have no fear.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, hope is more perfect than fear, since hope regards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and fear, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Now hope will not be in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Therefore neither will there be fear in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa018.htm#verse10">Psalm 18:10</a>): "The fear of the Lord is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, enduring for ever and ever."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Servile fear, or fear of punishment, will by no means be in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, since such a fear is excluded by the security which is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to everlasting <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, as stated above (I-II, 5, 4).

<p>But regard to filial fear, as it increases with the increase of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, so is it perfected when <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is made perfect; hence, in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, it will not have quite the same act as it has now.

<p>In order to make this clear, we must observe that the proper object of fear is a possible <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, just as the proper object of hope is a possible <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: and since the movement of fear is like one of avoidance, fear implies avoidance of a possible arduous <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, for little <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> inspire no fear. Now as a thing's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> consists in its staying in its own order, so a thing's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> consists in forsaking its order. Again, the order of a rational creature is that it should be under <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and above other creatures. Hence, just as it is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for a rational creature to submit, by love, to a lower creature, so too is it an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for it, if it submit not to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by presumptuously revolt against Him or contemn Him. Now this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is possible to a rational creature considered as to its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> on account of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> flexibility of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>; whereas in the blessed, it becomes impossible, by reason of the perfection of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Therefore the avoidance of this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that consists in non-subjection to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and is possible to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but impossible in the state of bliss, will be in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>; while in this life there is avoidance of this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as of something altogether possible. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, expounding the words of <a href="../cathen/08413a.htm">Job</a> (26:11), "The pillars of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> tremble, and dread at His beck," says (Moral. xvii, 29): "The heavenly powers that gaze on Him without ceasing, tremble while contemplating: but their awe, lest it should be of a penal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, is one not of fear but of wonder," because, to wit, they wonder at <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> supereminence and incomprehensibility. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> also (De Civ. Dei xiv, 9) in this sense, admits fear in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, although he leaves the question <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>. "If," he says, "this chaste fear that endureth for ever and ever is to be in the future life, it will not be a fear that is afraid of an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which might possibly occur, but a fear that holds fast to a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which we cannot lose. For when we love the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which we have acquired, with an unchangeable love, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, if it is allowable to say so, our fear is sure of avoiding <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Because chaste fear denotes a will that cannot consent to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and whereby we avoid <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> without trembling lest, in our weakness, we fall, and possess ourselves in the tranquillity born of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Else, if no kind of fear is possible there, perhaps fear is said to endure for ever and ever, because that which fear will lead us to, will be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">everlasting</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The passage quoted excludes from the blessed, the fear that denotes solicitude, and anxiety about <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but not the fear which is accompanied by security.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. ix) "the same things are both like and unlike <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. They are like by reason of a variable imitation of the Inimitable"--that is, because, so far as they can, they imitate <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who cannot be imitated perfectly--"they are unlike because they are the effects of a Cause of Whom they fall short <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> and immeasurably." Hence, if there be no fear in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (since there is none above Him to whom He may be subject) it does not follow that there is none in the blessed, whose <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in perfect subjection to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Hope implies a certain defect, namely the futurity of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, which ceases when <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is present: whereas fear implies a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> defect in a creature, in so far as it is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> distant from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and this defect will remain even in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Hence fear will not be cast out altogether.

<h2 id="article12">Article 12. Whether poverty of spirit is the beatitude corresponding to the gift of fear?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> of spirit is not the beatitude corresponding to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of fear. For fear is the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life, as explained above (<a href="#7">Article 7</a>): whereas <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> belongs to the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life, according to <a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse21">Matthew 19:21</a>, "If thou wilt be perfect, go sell what thou hast, and give to the poor." Therefore <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> of spirit does not correspond to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of fear.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/psa118.htm#verse120">Psalm 118:120</a>): "Pierce Thou my flesh with Thy fear," whence it seems to follow that it belongs to fear to restrain the flesh. But the curbing of the flesh seems to belong rather to the beatitude of mourning. Therefore the beatitude of mourning corresponds to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of fear, rather than the beatitude of <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of fear corresponds to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of hope, as stated above (9, ad 1). Now the last beatitude which is, "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," seems above all to correspond to <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, because according to <a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse2">Romans 5:2</a>, "we . . . <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the hope of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore that beatitude corresponds to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of fear, rather than <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> of spirit.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it was stated above (I-II, 70, 2) that the fruits correspond to the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a>. Now none of the fruits correspond to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of fear. Neither, therefore, does any of the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 4): "The fear of the Lord is befitting the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> of whom it is said: Blessed are the poor in spirit."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Poverty of spirit properly corresponds to fear. Because, since it belongs to filial fear to show reverence and submission to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whatever results from this submission belongs to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of fear. Now from the very fact that a man submits to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it follows that he ceases to seek greatness either in himself or in another but seeks it only in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For that would be inconsistent with perfect subjection to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/psa019.htm#verse8">Psalm 19:8</a>): "Some trust in chariots and some in horses; but we will call upon the name of . . . our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." It follows that if a man fear <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> perfectly, he does not, by <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, seek greatness either in himself or in external goods, viz. honors and <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>. On either case, this proceeds from <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> of spirit, in so far as the latter denotes either the voiding of a puffed up and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> spirit, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine's</a> interpretation (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 4), or the renunciation of worldly goods which is done in spirit, i.e. by one's own will, through the instigation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, according to the expounding of <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> on <a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse20">Luke 6:20</a> and <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> on <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse3">Matthew 5:3</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Since a beatitude is an act of perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, all the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> belong to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life. And this perfection seems to require that whoever would strive to obtain a perfect share of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods, needs to begin by despising earthly goods, wherefore fear holds the first place among the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>. Perfection, however, does not consist in the renunciation itself of temporal goods; since this is the way to perfection: whereas filial fear, to which the beatitude of <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> corresponds, is consistent with the perfection of wisdom, as stated above (A7,10).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The undue exaltation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> either in himself or in another is more directly opposed to that submission to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> which is the result of filial fear, than is external pleasure. Yet this is, in consequence, opposed to fear, since whoever <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and is subject to Him, takes no delight in things other than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Nevertheless, pleasure is not concerned, as exaltation is, with the arduous character of a thing which fear regards: and so the beatitude of <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> corresponds to fear directly, and the beatitude of mourning, consequently.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Hope denotes a movement by way of a relation of tendency to a term, whereas fear implies movement by way of a relation of withdrawal from a term: wherefore the last beatitude which is the term of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> perfection, fittingly corresponds to <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, by way of ultimate object; while the first beatitude, which implies withdrawal from external things which hinder submission to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, fittingly corresponds to fear.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As regards the fruits, it seems that those things correspond to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of fear, which pertain to the moderate use of temporal things or to abstinence therefrom; such are modesty, <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a> and <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>.
