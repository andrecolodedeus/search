<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the goodness of the will depends on the object?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does not depend on the object. For the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> cannot be directed otherwise than to what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: since "<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is outside the scope of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>," as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv). If therefore the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> depended on the object, it would follow that every act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and none bad.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is first of all in the end: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the end, as such, does not depend on any other. But, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vi, 5), "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of action is the end, but <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of making is never the end": because the latter is always ordained to the thing made, as to its end. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does not depend on any object.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, such as a thing is, such does it make a thing to be. But the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, by reason of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore it cannot give moral <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore the moral <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does not depend on the object.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. v, 1) that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is that <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> "from which men wish for just things": and accordingly, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> from which men wish for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things. But a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is one which is in accordance with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is from the fact that a man wills that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> are <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> differences of the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Because <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of themselves regard the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; just as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and falsehood regard reason; the act of which is divided <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> by the difference of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and falsehood, for as much as an opinion is said to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> or <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Consequently <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will are acts differing in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Now the specific difference in acts is according to objects, as stated above (Question 18, Article 5). Therefore <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the acts of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is derived properly from the objects.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not always directed to what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but sometimes to the apparent <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; which has indeed some measure of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but not of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that is simply suitable to be desired. Hence it is that the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not always <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but sometimes <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although an action can, in a certain way, be <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> last end; nevertheless such action is not an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as stated above (1, 1, ad 2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Good is presented to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as its object by the reason: and in so far as it is in accord with reason, it enters the moral order, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> moral <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> in the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: because the reason is the principle of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and moral acts, as stated above (Question 18, Article 5).

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the goodness of the will depends on the object alone?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does not depend on the object alone. For the end has a closer relationship to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> than to any other power. But the acts of the other powers derive <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> not only from the object but also from the end, as we have shown above (18, 04). Therefore the act also of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> derives <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> not only from the object but also from the end.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of an action is derived not only from the object but also from the circumstances, as stated above (Question 18, Article 3). But according to the diversity of circumstances there may be diversity of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> in the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: for instance, if a man will, when he ought, where he ought, as much as he ought, and how he ought, or if he will as he ought not. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> depends not only on the object, but also on the circumstances.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of circumstances excuses <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as stated above (Question 6, Article 8). But it would not be so, unless the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> depended on the circumstances. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> depend on the circumstances, and not only on the object.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> An action does not take its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the circumstances as such, as stated above (18, 10, ad 2). But <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> are specific differences of the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> depend, not on the circumstances, but on the object alone.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In every genus, the more a thing is first, the more simple it is, and the fewer the principles of which it consists: thus primary bodies are simple. Hence it is to be observed that the first things in every genus, are, in some way, simple and consist of one principle. Now the principle of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions is taken from the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> depend on some one thing; while the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of other acts may depend on several things.

<p>Now that one thing which is the principle in each genus, is not something <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to that genus, but something <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> thereto: because whatever is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> is reduced to something <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a>, as to its principle. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will's</a> act depends on that one thing alone, which of itself <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> in the act; and that one thing is the object, and not the circumstances, which are <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, as it were, of the act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The end is the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, but not of the other powers. Hence, in regard to the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> derived from the object, does not differ from that which is derived from the end, as they differ in the acts of the other powers; except perhaps <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, in so far as one end depends on another, and one act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> on another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Given that the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is fixed on some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, no circumstances can make that act bad. Consequently when it is said that a man wills a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> when he ought not, or where he ought not, this can be understood in two ways. First, so that this circumstance is referred to the thing willed. And thus the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not fixed on something <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: since to will to do something when it ought not to be done, is not to will something <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Secondly, so that the circumstance is referred to the act of willing. And thus, it is impossible to will something <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> when one ought not to, because one ought always to will what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: except, perhaps, <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, in so far as a man by willing some particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, is prevented from willing at the same time another <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which he ought to will at that time. And then <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> results, not from his willing that particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but from his not willing the other. The same applies to the other circumstances.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">Ignorance</a> of circumstances excuses <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, in so far as the circumstance affects the thing willed: that is to say, in so far as a man ignores the circumstances of the act which he wills.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the goodness of the will depends on reason?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does not depend on reason. For what comes first does not depend on what follows. But the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> before it belongs to reason, as is clear from what has been said above (Question 9, Article 1). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does not depend on reason.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vi, 2) that the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is "a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that is in conformity with right desire." But right desire is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the practical reason depends on the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, rather than conversely.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the mover does not depend on that which is moved, but vice versa. But the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> moves the reason and the other powers, as stated above (Question 9, Article 1). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does not depend on reason.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (De Trin. x): "It is an unruly will that persists in its desires in opposition to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> consists in not being unruly. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> depends on its being subject to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1,2), the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> depends properly on the object. Now the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will's</a> object is proposed to it by reason. Because the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> understood is the proportionate object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; while sensitive or <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is proportionate not to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> but to the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>: since the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> can tend to the universal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which reason apprehends; whereas the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> tends only to the particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, apprehended by the sensitive power. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> depends on reason, in the same way as it depends on the object.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> considered as such, i.e. as appetible, pertains to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> before pertaining to the reason. But considered as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> it pertains to the reason, before, under the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: because the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> cannot desire a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that is not previously apprehended by reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> speaks here of the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, in so far as it counsels and reasons about the means: for in this respect it is perfected by <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Now in regard to the means, the rectitude of the reason depends on its conformity with the desire of a due end: nevertheless the very desire of the due end presupposes on the part of reason a right apprehension of the end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The will moves the reason in one way: the reason moves the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in another, viz. on the part of the object, as stated above (Question 9, Article 01).

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the goodness of the will depends on the eternal law?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will does not depend on the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Because to one thing there is one rule and one measure. But the rule of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will, on which its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> depends, is right reason. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does not depend on the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "a measure is homogeneous with the thing measured" (Metaph. x, 1). But the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is not homogeneous with the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> cannot be the measure on which the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will depends.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a measure should be most certain. But the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is unknown to us. Therefore it cannot be the measure on which the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of our will depends.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Faust. xxii, 27) that "<a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, word or desire against the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>." But <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the root of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore, since <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> is contrary to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> depends on the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Wherever a number of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> are subordinate to one another, the effect depends more on the first than on the second <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: since the second <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> acts only in virtue of the first. Now it is from the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, which is the Divine <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason</a>, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> is the rule of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will, from which the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> derives its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/psa004.htm#verse6">Psalm 4:6-7</a>): "Many say: Who showeth us <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things? The light of Thy countenance, O Lord, is signed upon us": as though to say: "The light of our reason is able to show us <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, and guide our will, in so far as it is the light (i.e. derived from) Thy countenance." It is therefore evident that the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will depends on the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> much more than on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>: and when <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> fails we must have recourse to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">Eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> To one thing there are not several proximate measures; but there can be several measures if one is subordinate to the other.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A proximate measure is homogeneous with the thing measured; a remote measure is not.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is unknown to us according as it is in the Divine Mind: nevertheless, it becomes <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us somewhat, either by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> which is derived therefrom as its proper image; or by some sort of additional <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the will is evil when it is at variance with erring reason?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> when it is at variance with erring reason. Because the reason is the rule of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will, in so far as it is derived from the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>). But erring reason is not derived from the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Therefore erring reason is not the rule of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, if it be at variance with erring reason.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, the command of a lower authority does not bind if it be contrary to the command of a higher authority: for instance, if a provincial governor command something that is forbidden by the emperor. But erring reason sometimes proposes what is against the command of a higher power, namely, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Whose power is supreme. Therefore the decision of an erring reason does not bind. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> if it be at variance with erring reason.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is reducible to some <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> that is at variance with erring reason is not reducible to some <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>. For instance, if a man's reason <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> in telling him to commit fornication, his will in not willing to do so, cannot be reduced to any <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> when it is at variance with erring reason.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> As stated in the I, 79, 13, <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> is nothing else than the application of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to some action. Now <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is in the reason. Therefore when the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is at variance with erring reason, it is against <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. But every such <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; for it is written (<a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse23">Romans 14:23</a>): "All that is not of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>"--i.e. all that is against <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>--"is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> when it is at variance with erring reason.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> is a kind of dictate of the reason (for it is an application of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to action, as was stated in the I, 19, 13), to inquire whether the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> when it is at variance with erring reason, is the same as to inquire "whether an erring <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> binds." On this matter, some distinguished three kinds of actions: for some are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> generically; some are indifferent; some are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> generically. And they say that if reason or <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> tell us to do something which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> generically, there is no <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>: and in like manner if it tell us not to do something which is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> generically; since it is the same reason that prescribes what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and forbids what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. On the other hand if a man's reason or <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> tells him that he is bound by precept to do what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in itself; or that what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in itself, is forbidden, then his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> or <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errs</a>. In like manner if a man's reason or <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> tell him, that what is indifferent in itself, for instance to raise a straw from the ground, is forbidden or commanded, his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> or <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errs</a>. They say, therefore, that reason or <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> when erring in matters of indifference, either by commanding or by forbidding them, binds: so that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> which is at variance with that erring reason is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. But they say that when reason or <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errs</a> in commanding what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in itself, or in forbidding what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in itself and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, it does not bind; wherefore in such cases the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> which is at variance with erring reason or <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> is not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p>But this is unreasonable. For in matters of indifference, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> that is at variance with erring reason or <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in some way on account of the object, on which the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> depends; not indeed on account of the object according as it is in its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; but according as it is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> apprehended by reason as something <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to do or to avoid. And since the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is that which is proposed by the reason, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), from the very fact that a thing is proposed by the reason as being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> by tending thereto becomes <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And this is the case not only in indifferent matters, but also in those that are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in themselves. For not only indifferent matters can received the character of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>; but also that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, can receive the character of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, or that which is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, can receive the character of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, on account of the reason apprehending it as such. For instance, to refrain from fornication is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: yet the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does not tend to this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> except in so far as it is proposed by the reason. If, therefore, the erring reason propose it as an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> tends to it as to something <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, because it wills <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, not indeed that which is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in itself, but that which is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, through being apprehended as such by the reason. In like manner, to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in itself, and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: but the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does not tend thereto, except inasmuch as it is proposed by the reason. Consequently if it be proposed by the reason as something <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> tends to it as to something <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: not as if it were <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in itself, but because it is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, through the apprehension of the reason. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 9) that "properly speaking the incontinent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is one who does not follow right reason; but <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, he is also one who does not follow <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> reason." We must therefore conclude that, absolutely speaking, every will at variance with reason, whether right or erring, is always <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although the judgment of an erring reason is not derived from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet the erring reason puts forward its judgment as being <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and consequently as being derived from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from Whom is all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The saying of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> holds good when it is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that the inferior authority prescribes something contrary to the command of the higher authority. But if a man were to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the command of the proconsul to be the command of the emperor, in scorning the command of the proconsul he would scorn the command of the emperor. In like manner if a man were to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> was dictating something contrary to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> commandment, he would not be bound to abide by reason: but then reason would not be entirely <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>. But when erring reason proposes something as being commanded by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then to scorn the dictate of reason is to scorn the commandment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Whenever reason apprehends something as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, it apprehends it under some <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; for instance, as being something contrary to a divine precept, or as giving <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, or for some such like reason. And then that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is reduced to that <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the will is good when it abides by erring reason?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> when it abides by erring reason. For just as the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, when at variance with the reason, tends to that which reason judges to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; so, when in accord with reason, it tends to what reason judges to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> when it is at variance with reason, even when erring. Therefore even when it abides by erring reason, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is always <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, when it abides by the commandment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> commandment are proposed to us by the apprehension of the reason, even when it <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errs</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, even when it abides by erring reason.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> when it is at variance with erring reason. If, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> also when it abides by erring reason, it seems that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is always <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> when in conjunction with erring reason: so that in such a case a man would be in a dilemma, and, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, would <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: which is unreasonable. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> when it abides by erring reason.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The will of those who slew the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> was <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And yet it was in accord with the erring reason, according to <a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse2">John 16:2</a>: "The hour cometh, that whosoever killeth you, will think that he doth a service to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> can be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, when it abides by erring reason.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Whereas the previous question is the same as inquiring "whether an erring <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> binds"; so this question is the same as inquiring "whether an erring <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> excuses." Now this question depends on what has been said above about <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. For it was said (6, 8) that <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> sometimes <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> an act to be involuntary, and sometimes not. And since moral <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> consist in action in so far as it is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, as was stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>); it is evident that when <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> an act to be involuntary, it takes away the character of moral <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; but not, when it does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the act to be involuntary. Again, it has been stated above (Question 6, Article 8) that when <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is in any way willed, either directly or indirectly, it does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the act to be involuntary. And I call that <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> "directly" <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, to which the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> tends: and that, "indirectly" <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, which is due to negligence, by reason of a man not wishing to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what he ought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, as stated above (Question 6, Article 8).

<p>If then reason or <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> with an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> that is voluntary, either directly, or through negligence, so that one <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errs</a> about what one ought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; then such an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of reason or <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> does not excuse the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, that abides by that erring reason or <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, from being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But if the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> arise from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of some circumstance, and without any negligence, so that it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the act to be involuntary, then that <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of reason or <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> excuses the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, that abides by that erring reason, from being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For instance, if erring reason tell a man that he should go to another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> wife, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> that abides by that erring reason is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; since this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> arises from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the Divine Law, which he is bound to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. But if a man's reason, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errs</a> in mistaking another for his wife, and if he wish to give her her right when she asks for it, his <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is excused from being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: because this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> arises from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of a circumstance, which <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> excuses, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the act to be involuntary.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div.

Consequently in order that the thing to which the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> tends be called <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, it suffices, either that it be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in itself, or that it be apprehended as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But in order for it to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it must be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in both ways.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Just as in syllogistic arguments, granted one absurdity, others must needs follow; so in moral matters, given one absurdity, others must follow too. Thus suppose a man to seek vainglory, he will <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, whether he does his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> for vainglory or whether he omit to do it. Nor is he in a dilemma about the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: because he can put aside his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>. In like manner, suppose a man's reason or <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> through inexcusable <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, then <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> must needs result in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Nor is this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in a dilemma: because he can lay aside his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, since his <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is vincible and <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the goodness of the will, as regards the means, depends on the intention of the end?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does not depend on the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the end. For it has been stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>) that the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> depends on the object alone. But as regards the means, the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is one thing, and the end intended is another. Therefore in such matters the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does not depend on the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the end.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to wish to keep <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> commandment, belongs to a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. But this can be referred to an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> end, for instance, to vainglory or <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, by willing to obey <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the sake of temporal gain. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does not depend on the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the end.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> diversify the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, so do they diversify the end. But <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does not depend on the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of the end intended; since a man who wills to steal in order to give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, has an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will, although he intends a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> end. Therefore neither does the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> depend on the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the end intended.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. ix, 3) that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> rewards the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> rewards a thing because it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> depends on the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the end.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> may stand in a twofold relation to the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; first, as preceding it, secondly as following [Leonine edn.: 'accompanying'] it. The <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> precedes the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causally</a>, when we will something because we intend a certain end. And then the order to the end is considered as the reason of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the thing willed: for instance, when a man wills to fast for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake; because the act of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> is specifically <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> from the very fact that it is done for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake. Wherefore, since the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> depends on the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the thing willed, as stated above (1,2), it must, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, depend on the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the end.

<p>On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> follows the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, when it is added to a preceding act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; for instance, a man may will to do something, and may afterwards refer it to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And then the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the previous act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does not depend on the subsequent <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, except in so far as that act is repeated with the subsequent <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> When the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the act of willing, the order to the end is considered as the reason of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the object, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> cannot be said to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, if an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of willing. For when a man wills to give an <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> for the sake of vainglory, he wills that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in itself, under a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; and therefore, as willed by him, it is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Wherefore his <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. If, however, the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is subsequent to the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, then the latter may be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> does not spoil that act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> which preceded, but that which is repeated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As we have already stated (06, ad 1), "<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> results from each particular defect, but <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> from the whole and entire <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>." Hence, whether the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> tend to what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in itself, even under the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; or to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> under the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, it will be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in either case. But in order for the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it must tend to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> under the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; in other words, it must will the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether the degree of goodness or malice in the will depends on the degree of good or evil in the intention?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the degree of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> depends on the degree of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in the intention. Because on <a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse35">Matthew 12:35</a>, "A <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> out of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does as much <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as he intends." But the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> gives <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> not only to the external action, but also to the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as stated above (<a href="#7">Article 7</a>). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of a man's <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is according to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of his <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if you add to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, you add to the effect. But the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore a man's <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, according as his <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil actions</a>, a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in proportion to his <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>: for if a man were to throw a stone with a murderous <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, he would be guilty of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>. Therefore, for the same reason, in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> actions, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in proportion to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> intended.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> can be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore, for the same reason, the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> can be better, and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> less <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In regard to both the act, and the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the end, we may consider a twofold <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>: one, on the part of the object, by reason of a man willing or doing a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that is greater; the other, taken from the intensity of the act, according as a man wills or acts intensely; and this is more on the part of the agent.

<p>If then we speak of these respective quantities from the point of view of the object, it is evident that the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> in the act does not depend on the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>. With regard to the external act this may happen in two ways. First, through the object that is ordained to the intended end not being proportionate to that end; for instance, if a man were to give ten pounds, he could not realize his <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, if he intended to buy a thing worth a hundred pounds. Secondly, on account of the obstacles that may supervene in regard to the exterior action, which obstacles we are unable to remove: for instance, a man intends to go to Rome, and encounters obstacles, which prevent him from going. On the other hand, with regard to the interior act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, this happens in only one way: because the interior acts of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> are in our power, whereas the external actions are not. But the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> can will an object that is not proportionate to the intended end: and thus the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> that tends to that object considered absolutely, is not so <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>. Yet because the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> also belongs, in a way, to the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, inasmuch, to wit, as it is the reason thereof; it comes to pass that the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> redounds upon the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; that is to say, in so far as the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> wills some great <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for an end, although that by which it wills to gain so great a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, is not proportionate to that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p>But if we consider the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> and in the act, according to their respective intensity, then the intensity of the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> redounds upon the interior act and the exterior act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: since the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> stands in relation to them as a kind of form, as is clear from what has been said above (12, 4; 18, 6). And yet considered materially, while the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is intense, the interior or exterior act may be not so intense, materially speaking: for instance, when a man does not will with as much intensity to take medicine as he wills to regain health. Nevertheless the very fact of intending health intensely, redounds, as a formal principle, upon the intense volition of medicine.

<p>We must observe, however, that the intensity of the interior or exterior act, may be referred to the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> as its object: as when a man intends to will intensely, or to do something intensely. And yet it does not follow that he wills or acts intensely; because the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> in the interior or exterior act does not depend on the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> intended, as is shown above. And hence it is that a man does not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> as much as he intends to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>: because the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> is measured by the intensity of the act, as we shall show later on (20, 04; 114, 4).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> speaks of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as in the estimation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who considers principally the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the end. Wherefore another <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says on the same passage that "the treasure of the heart is the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, according to which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> judges our works." For the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, as stated above, redounds, so to speak, upon the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which makes even the external act to be <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sight.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is not the whole <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Hence the argument does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The mere <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> suffices to make the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: and therefore too, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But the same reasoning does not apply to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, as stated above (ad 2).

Because it is impossible for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will to be conformed to the Divine will; as appears from the word of <a href="../bible/isa055.htm#verse9">Isaiah 55:9</a>: "As the heavens are exalted above the earth, so are My ways exalted above your ways, and My thoughts above your thoughts." If therefore <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> depended on its conformity to the Divine will, it would follow that it is impossible for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Which is inadmissible.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as our wills arise from the Divine will, so does our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> flow from the Divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. But our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> does not require to be conformed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> many things that we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not. Therefore there is no need for our will to be conformed to the Divine will.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is a principle of action. But our action cannot be conformed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a>. Therefore neither can our will be conformed to His.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse39">Matthew 26:39</a>): "Not as I will, but as Thou wilt": which words He said, because "He wishes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be upright and to tend to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> expounds in the Enchiridion [Enarr. in Ps. 32, serm. i.]. But the rectitude of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> depends on its conformity to the Divine will.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#7">Article 7</a>), the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> depends on the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the end. Now the last end of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the Sovereign Good, namely, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated above (1, 8; 3, 1). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will requires it to be ordained to the Sovereign Good, that is, to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>Now this Good is primarily and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> compared to the Divine will, as its proper object. Again, that which is first in any genus is the measure and rule of all that belongs to that genus. Moreover, everything attains to rectitude and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, in so far as it is in accord with its proper measure. Therefore, in order that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> it needs to be conformed to the Divine will.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will cannot be conformed to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> so as to equal it, but only so as to imitate it. In like manner <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is conformed to the Divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, in so far as it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> action is conformed to the Divine, in so far as it is becoming to the agent: and this by way of imitation, not by way of equality.

<p>From the above may be gathered the replies to the Second and Third Objections.

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether it is necessary for the human will, in order to be good, to be conformed to the Divine will, as regards the thing willed?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will need not always be conformed to the Divine will, as regards the thing willed. For we cannot will what we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not: since the apprehended <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. But in many things we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will cannot be conformed to the Divine will as to the thing willed.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills to damn the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whom He foresees about to die in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. If therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> were bound to conform his will to the Divine will, in the point of the thing willed, it would follow that a man is bound to will his own damnation. Which is inadmissible.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no one is bound to will what is against filial piety. But if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> were to will what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills, this would sometimes be contrary to filial piety: for instance, when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills the death of a father: if his son were to will it also, it would be against filial piety. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not bound to conform his will to the Divine will, as to the thing willed.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> (1) On <a href="../bible/psa032.htm#verse1">Psalm 32:1</a>, "Praise becometh the upright," a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "That <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has an upright heart, who wills what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills." But everyone is bound to have an upright heart. Therefore everyone is bound to will what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills.

<p>(2) Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> takes its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> from the object, as does every act. If therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is bound to conform his will to the Divine will, it follows that he is bound to conform it, as to the thing willed.

<p>(3) Moreover, opposition of wills arises from men willing different things. But whoever has a will in opposition to the Divine will, has an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will. Therefore whoever does not conform his will to the Divine will, as to the thing willed, has an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As is evident from what has been said above (3,5), the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> tends to its object, according as it is proposed by the reason. Now a thing may be considered in various ways by the reason, so as to appear <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> from one point of view, and not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> from another point of view. And therefore if a man's will wills a thing to be, according as it appears to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, his <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who wills that thing not to be, according as it appears <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, is also <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Thus a judge has a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will, in willing a <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a> to be put to death, because this is just: while the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of another--e.g. the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a>'s wife or son, who wishes him not to be put to death, inasmuch as killing is a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, is also <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p>Now since the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> follows the apprehension of the reason or <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; the more universal the aspect of the apprehended <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, the more universal the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to which the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> tends. This is evident in the example given above: because the judge has care of the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and therefore he wishes the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a>'s death, which has the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in relation to the common estate; whereas the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a>'s wife has to consider the private, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and from this point of view she wishes her husband, the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a>, not to be put to death. Now the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is that which is apprehended by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is the Maker and Governor of all things: hence whatever He wills, He wills it under the aspect of the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; this is His own Goodness, which is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. On the other hand, the apprehension of a creature, according to its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, is of some particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, proportionate to that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now a thing may happen to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> under a particular aspect, and yet not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> under a universal aspect, or vice versa, as stated above. And therefore it comes to pass that a certain <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> from willing something considered under a particular aspect, which thing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills not, under a universal aspect, and vice versa. And hence too it is, that various wills of various men can be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in respect of opposite things, for as much as, under various aspects, they wish a particular thing to be or not to be.

<p>But a man's <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not right in willing a particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, unless he refer it to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as an end: since even the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> of each part is ordained to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the whole. Now it is the end that supplies the formal reason, as it were, of willing whatever is directed to the end. Consequently, in order that a man will some particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> with a right <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, he must will that particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> materially, and the Divine and universal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, formally. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is bound to be conformed to the Divine will, as to that which is willed formally, for it is bound to will the Divine and universal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; but not as to that which is willed materially, for the reason given above.

<p>At the same time in both these respects, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is conformed to the Divine, in a certain degree. Because inasmuch as it is conformed to the Divine will in the common aspect of the thing willed, it is conformed thereto in the point of the last end. While, inasmuch as it is not conformed to the Divine will in the thing willed materially, it is conformed to that will considered as efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; since the proper inclination consequent to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, or to the particular apprehension of some particular thing, comes to a thing from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as its efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Hence it is customary to say that a man's will, in this respect, is conformed to the Divine will, because it wills what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wishes him to will.

<p>There is yet another kind of conformity in respect of the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">formal</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, consisting in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> willing something from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills it. And this conformity is also reduced to the formal conformity, that is in respect of the last end, which is the proper object of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> We can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in a general way what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills. For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that whatever <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills, He wills it under the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Consequently whoever wills a thing under any aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, has a will conformed to the Divine will, as to the reason of the thing willed. But we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills in particular: and in this respect we are not bound to conform our will to the Divine will.

<p>But in the state of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, every one will see in each thing that he wills, the relation of that thing to what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills in that particular <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Consequently he will conform his will to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in all things not only formally, but also materially.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not will the damnation of a man, considered precisely as damnation, nor a man's death, considered precisely as death, because, "He wills all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to be saved" (<a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse4">1 Timothy 2:4</a>); but He wills such things under the aspect of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Wherefore in regard to such things it suffices for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to will the upholding of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order.

<p>Wherefore the reply to the Third Objection is evident.

<p>To the first argument advanced in a contrary sense, it should be said that a man who conforms his will to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a>, in the aspect of reason of the thing willed, wills what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills, more than the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who conforms his will to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a>, in the point of the very thing willed; because the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> tends more to the end, than to that which is on account of the end.

<p>To the second, it must be replied that the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and form of an act are taken from the object considered formally, rather than from the object considered materially.

<p>To the third, it must be said that there is no opposition of wills when several people desire different things, but not under the same aspect: but there is opposition of wills, when under one and the same aspect, one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> wills a thing which another wills not. But there is no question of this here.
