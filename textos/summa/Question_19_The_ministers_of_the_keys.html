<h1>Question 19. The ministers of the keys</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5019.htm#article1"> Did the priest of the Law have the keys?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5019.htm#article2"> Did Christ have the keys?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5019.htm#article3"> Do priests alone have the keys?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5019.htm#article4"> Do holy men who are not priests have the keys or their use?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5019.htm#article5"> Do wicked priests have the effective use of the keys?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5019.htm#article6"> Do those who are schismatics, heretics, excommunicate, suspended or degraded, have the use of the keys?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the priest of the Law had the keys?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> had the keys. For the possession of the keys results from having orders. But they had orders since they were called <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> had the keys.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> states (Sent. iv, D, 18), there are two keys, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of discretion, and power of judgment. But the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> had authority for both of these: therefore they had the keys.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> had some power over the rest of the people, which power was not temporal, else the kingly power would not have differed from the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> power. Therefore it was a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power; and this is the key. Therefore they had the key.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The keys are ordained to the opening of the heavenly kingdom, which could not be opened before <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> had not the keys. Further, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the old Law did not confer <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Now the gate of the heavenly kingdom could not be opened except by means of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore it could not be opened by means of those <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, so that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who administered them, had not the keys of the heavenly kingdom.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some have held that, under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, the keys of the kingdom were in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, because the right of imposing punishment for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was conferred on them, as related in <a href="../bible/lev005.htm">Leviticus 5</a>, which right seems to belong to the keys; but that these keys were incomplete then, whereas now they are complete as bestowed by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> on the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>.

<p>But this seems to be contrary to the intent of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> in the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse11">Hebrews 9:11-12</a>). For there the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is given the preference over the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> came, "a <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to come," and brought us "by His own blood" into a tabernacle not made with hand, whither the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> brought men "by the blood of goats and of oxen." Hence it is clear that the power of that <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> did not reach to heavenly things but to the shadow of heavenly things: and so, we must say with others that they had not the keys, but that the keys were foreshadowed in them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The keys of the kingdom go with the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is brought into the heavenly kingdom, but such was not the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of Levi; hence it had the keys, not of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, but of an earthly tabernacle.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> had authority to discern and judge, but not to admit those they judged into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, but only into the shadow of heavenly things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> They had no <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power, since, by the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, they cleansed men not from their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> but from irregularities, so that those who were cleansed by them could enter into a tabernacle which was "made with hand."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether Christ had the key?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not have the key. For the key goes with the character of order. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not have a character. Therefore He had not the key.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had power of "excellence" in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, so that He could produce the sacramental effect without the sacramental rite. Now the key is something sacramental. Therefore He needed no key, and it would have been useless to Him to have it.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/rev003.htm#verse7">Apocalypse 3:7</a>): "These things saith . . . He that hath the key of David," etc.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The power to do a thing is both in the instrument and in the principal agent, but not in the same way since it is more perfectly in the latter. Now the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> which we have, like other sacramental powers, is instrumental: whereas it is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as principal agent in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, by authority, if we consider Him as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, if we consider Him as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> [For <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>' later teaching on this point, Cf. III, 48, 6; I-II, 112, 1, AD 1. But the very notion of a key expresses a power to open and shut, whether this be done by the principal agent or by an instrument. Consequently we must admit that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had the key, but in a higher way than His ministers, wherefore He is said to have the key of "excellence."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A character implies the notion of something derived from another, hence the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> which we receive from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> results from the character whereby we are conformed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, whereas in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> it results not from a character, but from the principal form.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The key, which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had was not sacramental, but the origin of the sacramental key.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether priests alone have the keys?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that not only <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> have the keys. For <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. vii, 12) that the "doorkeepers have to tell the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> from the bad, so as to admit the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and keep out the bad." Now this is the definition of the keys, as appears from what has been said (17, 2). Therefore not only <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> but even doorkeepers have the keys.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the keys are conferred on <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> when by being anointed they receive power from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But kings of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> peoples also receive power from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and are <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by being anointed. Therefore not only <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> have the keys.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> is an order belonging to an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. But sometimes a number of people together seem to have the key, because certain Chapters can pass a sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, which pertains to the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a>. Therefore not only <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> have the key.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is not capable of receiving the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, since she is not competent to teach, according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse34">1 Corinthians 14:34</a>). But some <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> (abbesses, for instance, who exercise a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power over their subjects), seem to have the keys. Therefore not only <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> have the keys.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Poenit. i): "This right," viz. of binding and loosing, "is granted to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> alone."

<p>Further, by receiving the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a>, a man is set up between the people and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But this belongs to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> alone, who is "ordained . . . in the things that appertain to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that he may offer up <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>" (<a href="../bible/heb005.htm#verse1">Hebrews 5:1</a>). Therefore only <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> have the keys.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There are two kinds of key. one reaches to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> itself directly, by remitting <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and thus removing the obstacles to the entrance into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>; and this is called the key of "order." Priests alone have this key, because they alone are ordained for the people in the things which appertain to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> directly. The other key reaches to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, not directly but through the medium of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Militant. By this key a man goes to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, since, by its means, a man is shut out from or admitted to the fellowship of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Militant, by <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> or <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>. This is called the key of "<a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>" in the external court, wherefore even those who are not <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> can have this key, e.g. <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacons</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> elect, and others who can <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a>. But it is not properly called a key of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, but a disposition thereto.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The doorkeepers have the key for taking care of those things which are contained in a material temple, and they have to judge whether a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> should be excluded from or admitted to that temple; which judgment they pronounce, not by their own authority, but in pursuance to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> judgment, so that they appear to be the administrators of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Kings have no power in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> matters, so that they do not receive the key of the heavenly kingdom. Their power is confined to temporal matters, and this too can only come to them from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as appears from <a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse1">Romans 13:1</a>. Nor are they <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the unction of a sacred order: their anointing is merely a sign that the excellence of their power comes down to them from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and that, under <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, they reign over the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Just as in civil matters the whole power is sometimes vested in a judge, as in a kingdom, whereas sometimes it is vested in many exercising various offices but acting together with equal rights (Ethic. viii, 10,11), so too, <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> may be exercised both by one alone, e.g. a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and by many together, e.g. by a Chapter, and thus they have the key of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, but they have not all together the key of order.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse11">1 Timothy 2:11</a>; <a href="../bible/tit002.htm#verse5">Titus 2:5</a>), <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is in a state of subjection: wherefore she can have no <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> also says (Ethic. viii) that it is a corruption of public life when the government comes into the hands of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. Consequently a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> has neither the key of order nor the key of jurisdiction. Nevertheless a certain use of the keys is allowed to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, such as the right to correct other <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who are under them, on account of the danger that might threaten if men were to dwell under the same roof.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether holy men who are not priests have the keys?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, even those who are not <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, have the use of the keys. For loosing and binding, which are the effects of the keys, derive their efficacy from the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>. Now those are most conformed to <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, who follow <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, suffering by patience and other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Therefore it seems that even if they have not the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> order, they can bind and loose.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/heb007.htm#verse7">Hebrews 7:7</a>): "Without all contradiction, that which is less is blessed by the greater [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'better']." Now "in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> matters," according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. vi, 8), "to be better is to be greater." Therefore those who are better, i.e. who have more <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, can <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> others by absolving them. Hence the same conclusion follows.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> "Action belongs to that which has the power," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Somno et Vigil. i). But the key which is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power belongs to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> alone. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> alone are competent to have the use of the keys.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There is this difference between a principal and an instrumental agent, that the latter does not produce, in the effect, its own likeness, but the likeness of the principal agent, whereas the principal agent produces its own likeness. Consequently a thing becomes a principal agent through having a form, which it can reproduce in another, whereas an instrumental agent is not constituted thus, but through being applied by the principal agent in order to produce a certain effect. Since therefore in the act of the keys the principal agent by authority is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and by <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>,* it follows that on account of the very fulness of Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> in Him, and of the perfection of His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, He is competent to exercise the act of the keys. [For <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>' later teaching on this point, cf. III, 48, 6; I-II, 112, 1, ad 1. But another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not competent to exercise this act as principal agent, since neither can he give another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> whereby <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are remitted, nor can he <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> sufficiently, so that he is nothing more than an instrumental agent. Consequently the recipient of the effect of the keys, is likened, not to the one who uses the keys, but to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore, no matter how much <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> a man may have, he cannot produce the effect of the keys, unless he be appointed to that purpose by receiving orders.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Just as between instrument and effect there is need or likeness, not of a similar form, but of aptitude in the instrument for the effect, so is it as regards the instrument and the principal agent. The former is the likeness between <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men and the suffering <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, nor does it bestow on them the use of the keys.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although a mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> for another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> condignly, yet the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can co-operate in the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of another. Hence there is a twofold <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>. One proceeds from a mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as meriting by his own act: this <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> can be conferred by any <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in whom <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> dwells by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, in so far as he excels in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> whom he blesses. The other <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> is when a man blesses, as applying a <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> instrumentally through the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and this requires excellence of order and not of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether wicked priests have the use of the keys?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> have not the use of the keys. For in the passage where the use of the keys is bestowed on the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse22">John 20:22-23</a>), the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is promised. But <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men have not the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Therefore they have not the use of the keys.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no wise king entrusts his enemy with the dispensation of his treasure. Now the use of the keys consists in dispensing the treasure of the King of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, Who is Wisdom itself. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, who are His enemies on account of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, have not the use of the keys.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Bapt. v, 21) that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "gives the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> even through <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, but <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> itself only by Himself or through His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>." Hence He forgives <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by Himself, or by those who are members of the Dove. But the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is the use of the keys. Therefore sinners, who are not "members of the Dove," have not the use of the keys.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> cannot effect reconciliation, for, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Pastor. i, 11), "if an unacceptable <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is sent to intercede, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is provoked to yet greater severity." But the use of the keys implies a kind of intercession, as appears in the form of <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> cannot use the keys effectively.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is in the state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a>. If, therefore, no one could use the keys in giving <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> unless he were in a state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a>, no one would <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he had been <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a>, which would be very unfitting.

<p>Further, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of the minister cannot void the liberality of his lord. But the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is no more than a minister. Therefore he cannot by his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> take away from us the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has given through him.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Just as participation of a form to be induced into an effect does not make a thing to be an instrument, so neither does the loss of that form prevent that thing being used as an instrument. Consequently, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is merely an instrument in the use of the keys, however much he may through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be deprived of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, whereby <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven, yet he is by no means deprived of the use of the keys.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is requisite for the use of the keys, not as being indispensable for the purpose, but because it is unbecoming for the user to use them without it, though he that submits to them receives their effect.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> An earthly king can be cheated and deceived in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of his treasure, and so he does not entrust his enemy with the dispensation thereof. But the King of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> cannot be cheated, because all tends to His own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, even the abuse of the keys by some, for He can make <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> come out of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and produce many <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> effects through <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men. Hence the comparison fails.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> speaks of the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in so far as <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men co-operate therein, not by virtue of the keys, but by <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of congruity. Hence He says that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> confers the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> even through <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men, and among the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> which is the use of the keys should be reckoned: but that through "members of the Dove," i.e. <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, He grants forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, in so far as He remits <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> on account of their intercession.

<p>We might also reply that by "members of the Dove" he means all who are not cut off from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, for those who receive the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> from them, receive <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, whereas those who receive the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> from those who are cut off from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, do not receive <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, because they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in so doing, except in the case of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, which, in cases of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, may be received even from one who is <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> which the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> proffers on his own account, is not efficacious: but that which he makes as a minister of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, is efficacious through the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Yet in both ways the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> should profit those who are subject to him.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether those who are schismatics, heretics, excommunicate, suspended or degraded have the use of the keys?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that those who are schismatics, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a>, suspended or degraded have the use of the keys. For just as the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> results from orders, so does the power of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. But the above cannot lose the use of the power of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, since if they do <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> it is valid, though they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in doing so. Therefore neither can they lose the use of the keys.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, any active <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power in one who has the use of his <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> can be exercised by him when he wills. Now the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> remains in the aforesaid, for, since it is only conferred with orders, they would have to be reordained when they return to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Therefore, since it is an active power, they can exercise it when they will.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is hindered by guilt more than by punishment. Now <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, suspension and degradation are punishments. Therefore, since a man does not lose the use of the keys on account of guilt, it seems that he does not lose it on account of the aforesaid.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. cxxi in Joan.) that the "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> forgives <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." Now it is the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which unites its members. Since therefore the above are disunited from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, it seems that they have not the use of the keys in remitting <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p>Further, no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>. Now it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for anyone to seek <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> from the above, for he disobeys the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in so doing. Therefore he cannot be <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> by them: and so the same conclusion follows.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In all the above the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> remains as to its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, but its use is hindered on account of the lack of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. For since the use of the keys requires in the user authority over the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> on whom they are used, as stated above (17, 2, ad 2), the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> on whom one can exercise the use of the keys is a man under one's authority. And since it is by appointment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has authority over another, so a man may be deprived of his authority over another by his ecclesiastical superiors. Consequently, since the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> deprives <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, schismatics and the like, by withdrawing their subjects from them either altogether or in some respect, in so far as they are thus deprived, they cannot have the use of the keys.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, on which the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> exercises his power, is not a man but wheaten bread, and in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is simply a man. Wherefore, just as, were a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> to be without wheaten bread, he could not <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a>, so neither can a prelate <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> if he be deprived of his authority, yet he can <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a>, albeit to his own damnation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The assertion is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, provided <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> be not lacking as it is in the case in point.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Sin, of itself, does not remove <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as certain punishments do: so that punishment is a hindrance not because it is contrary to the effect, but for the reason stated.
