<h1>Question 19. The unity of Christ's operation</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/4019.htm#article1"> In Christ, was there one or several operations of the Godhead and Manhood?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4019.htm#article2"> In Christ, were there several operations of the human nature?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4019.htm#article3"> Did Christ by His human operation merit anything for Himself?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4019.htm#article4"> Did He merit anything for us by it?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether in Christ there is only one operation of the Godhead and Manhood?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there is but one operation of the Godhead and the Manhood. For <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. ii): "The most <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> operation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is made manifest to us by the supersubstantial Word having taken flesh integrally and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, and having operated and suffered whatsoever befits His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and Divine operation." But he here mentions only one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and Divine operation, which is written in Greek <em>theandrike</em>, i.e. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>-manlike. Hence it seems that there is but one composite operation in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, there is but one operation of the principal and instrumental agent. Now the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was the instrument of the Divine, as was said above (7, 1, ad 3; 8, 1, ad 1;k1 18, 1, ad 2). Hence the operations of the Divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> natures in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> are the same.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, since in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there are two natures in one hypostasis or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, whatever pertains to the hypostasis or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is one and the same. But operation pertains to the hypostasis or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, for it is only a subsisting suppositum that operates; hence, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. i, 1), acts belong to singulars. Hence in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there is only one operation of the Godhead and the Manhood.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, as being belongs to a subsisting hypostasis, so also does operation. But on account of the unity of hypostasis there is only one operation of the Godhead and the (17, 2). Hence, on account of the same unity, there is one operation in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, as being belongs to a sub-operated there is one operation. But the same thing was operated by the Godhead and the Manhood, as the healing of the lepers or the raising of the dead. Hence it seems that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there is but one operation of the Godhead and the Manhood.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Fide ii, 8): "How can the same operation spring from different powers? Cannot the lesser operate as the greater? And can there be one operation where there are different <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>?"

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was said above (Question 18, Article 1), the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who placed one will in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> placed one operation in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Now in order better to understand their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> opinion, we must bear in mind that wherever there are several mutually ordained agents, the inferior is moved by the superior, as in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> the body is moved by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the lower powers by the reason. And thus the actions and movements of the inferior principle are things operated rather than operations. Now what pertains to the highest principle is properly the operation; thus we say of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that to walk, which belongs to the feet, and to touch, which belongs to the hand, are things operated by the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>--one of which is operated by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> through the feet, the other through the hands. And because it is the same <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that operates in both cases, there is only one indifferent operation, on the part of the thing operating, which is the first moving principle; but difference is found on the part of what is operated. Now, as in a mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> the body is moved by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and the sensitive by the rational <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, so in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is moved and ruled by the Divine. Hence they said that there is one indifferent operation on the part of the Godhead operating, but divers things operated, inasmuch as the Godhead of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did one thing by Itself, as to uphold all things by the word of His power--and another thing by His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as to walk in body. Hence the Sixth Council [Third Council of Constantinople, Act. 10] quotes the words of Severus the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, who said: "What things were done and wrought by the one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, differ greatly; for some are becoming to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and some are <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, as to walk bodily on the earth is indeed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, but to give hale steps to sickly limbs, wholly unable to walk on the ground, is becoming to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Yet one, i.e. Incarnate Word, wrought one and the other--neither was this from one <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and that from another; nor can we <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> affirm that because there are distinct things operated there are therefore two operating natures and forms."

<p>But herein they were deceived, for what is moved by another has a twofold action--one which it has from its own form--the other, which it has inasmuch as it is moved by another; thus the operation of an axe of itself is to cleave; but inasmuch as it is moved by the craftsman, its operation is to make benches. Hence the operation which belongs to a thing by its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> is proper to it, nor does it belong to the mover, except in so far as he makes use of this kind of thing for his work: thus to heat is the proper operation of fire, but not of a smith, except in so far as he makes use of fire for heating iron. But the operation which belongs to the thing, as moved by another, is not distinct from the operation of the mover; thus to make a bench is not the work of the axe independently of the workman. Hence, wheresoever the mover and the moved have different forms or operative faculties, there must the operation of the mover and the proper operation of the moved be distinct; although the moved shares in the operation of the mover, and the mover makes use of the operation of the moved, and, consequently, each acts in communion with the other.

<p>Therefore in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> has its proper form and power whereby it acts; and so has the Divine. Hence the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> has its proper operation distinct from the Divine, and conversely. Nevertheless, the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> makes use of the operation of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as of the operation of its instrument; and in the same way the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> shares in the operation of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, as an instrument shares in the operation of the principal agent. And this is what Pope Leo says (Ep. ad Flavian. xxviii): "Both forms" (i.e. both the Divine and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>) "do what is proper to each in union with the other, i.e. the Word operates what belongs to the Word, and the flesh carries out what belongs to flesh."

<p>But if there were only one operation of the Godhead and manhood in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, it would be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to say either that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> had not its proper form and power (for this could not possibly be said of the Divine), whence it would follow that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was only the Divine operation; or it would be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to say that from the Divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> power there was made up one power. Now both of these are impossible. For by the first the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is supposed to be imperfect; and by the second a confusion of the natures is supposed. Hence it is with reason that the <a href="../cathen/04310a.htm">Sixth Council</a> (Act. 18) condemned this opinion, and decreed as follows: "We confess two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, indivisible, unconvertible, unconfused, and inseparable operations in the same <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> our <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>"; i.e. the Divine operation and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> operation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> places in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> a theandric, i.e. a God-manlike or Divino-<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, operation not by any confusion of the operations or powers of both <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, but inasmuch as His Divine operation employs the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, and His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> operation shares in the power of the Divine. Hence, as he says in a certain epistle (Ad Caium iv), "what is of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> He works beyond <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; and this is shown by the Virgin conceiving supernaturally and by the unstable waters bearing up the weight of bodily feet." Now it is clear that to be begotten belongs to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and likewise to walk; yet both were in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> supernaturally. So, too, He wrought Divine things humanly, as when He healed the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> with a touch. Hence in the same epistle he adds: "He performed Divine works not as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> works not as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does, but, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> having been made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, by a new operation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>."

<p>Now, that he understood two operations in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, one of the Divine and the other of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, is clear from what he says, Div. Nom. ii: "Whatever pertains to His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> operation the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> no-wise share in, except, as one might say, by their most gracious and merciful will," i.e. inasmuch as the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> in their mercy wished <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to do and to suffer <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> things. And he adds: "He is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the unchangeable <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> Word by the sublime and unspeakable operation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which, being made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for us, He wrought." Hence it is clear that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> operation, in which the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> do not share, except by Their merciful consent, is distinct from His operation, as the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, wherein the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> share.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The instrument is said to act through being moved by the principal agent; and yet, besides this, it can have its proper operation through its own form, as stated above of fire. And hence the action of the instrument as instrument is not distinct from the action of the principal agent; yet it may have another operation, inasmuch as it is a thing. Hence the operation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as the instrument of the Godhead, is not distinct from the operation of the Godhead; for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> wherewith the manhood of Christ saves us and that wherewith His Godhead saves us are not distinct; nevertheless, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, inasmuch as it is a certain <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, has a proper operation distinct from the Divine, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> To operate belongs to a subsisting hypostasis; in accordance, however, with the form and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> from which the operation receives its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Hence from the diversity of forms or natures spring the divers <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of operations, but from the unity of hypostasis springs the numerical unity as regards the operation of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>: thus fire has two operations specifically different, namely, to illuminate and to heat, from the difference of light and heat, and yet the illumination of the fire that illuminates at one and the same time is numerically one. So, likewise, in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> two specifically different operations by reason of His two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>; nevertheless, each of the operations at one and the same time is numerically one, as one walking and one healing.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Being and operation belong to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> by reason of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; yet in a different manner. For being belongs to the very constitution of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and in this respect it has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a term; consequently, unity of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> requires unity of the complete and personal being. But operation is an effect of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> by reason of a form or <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence plurality of operations is not incompatible with personal unity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The proper work of the Divine operation is different from the proper work of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> operation. Thus to heal a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> is a proper work of the Divine operation, but to touch him is the proper work of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> operation. Now both these operations concur in one work, inasmuch as one <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> acts in union with the other.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether in Christ there are several human operations?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there are several <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> operations. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> communicates with plants by His nutritive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, with the brutes by His sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> by His <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, even as other men do. Now the operations of a plant as plant and of an animal as animal are different. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has several operations.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, powers and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are distinguished by their acts. Now in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> there were divers powers and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>; therefore also divers operations.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, instruments ought to be proportioned to their operations. Now the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body has divers members of different form, and consequently fitted to divers operations. Therefore in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there are divers operations in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 15), "operation is consequent upon the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." But in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there is only one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there is only one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> operation.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since it is by his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is what he is; that operation is called <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> simply, which proceeds from the reason through the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which is the rational <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Now if there is any operation in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> which does not proceed from the reason and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, it is not simply a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> operation, but belongs to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by reason of some part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>--sometimes by reason of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of elementary bodies, as to be borne downwards--sometimes by reason of the force of the vegetative <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as to be nourished, and to grow--sometimes by reason of the sensitive part, as to see and hear, to <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> and remember, to desire and to be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>. Now between these operations there is a difference. For the operations of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are to some extent obedient to reason, and consequently they are somewhat rational and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> inasmuch as they obey reason, as is clear from the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. i, 13). But the operations that spring from the vegetative <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, or from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of elemental bodies, are not subject to reason; consequently they are nowise rational; nor simply <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, but only as regards a part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now it was said (1) that when a subordinate agent acts by its own form, the operations of the inferior and of the superior agent are distinct; but when the inferior agent acts only as moved by the superior agent, then the operation of the superior and the inferior agent is one.

<p>And hence in every mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> the operations of the elemental body and of the vegetative <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are distinct from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will's</a> operation, which is properly <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>; so likewise the operations of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> inasmuch as it is not moved by reason; but inasmuch as it is moved by reason, the operations of the sensitive and the rational part are the same. Now there is but one operation of the rational part if we consider the principle of the operation, which is the reason and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; but the operations are many if we consider their relationship to various objects. And there were some who called this a diversity of things operated rather than of operations, judging the unity of the operation solely from the operative principle. And it is in this respect that we are now considering the unity and plurality of operations in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p>Hence in every mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> there is but one operation, which is properly called <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>; but besides this there are in a mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> certain other operations, which are not strictly <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, as was said above. But in the Man <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> there was no motion of the sensitive part which was not ordered by reason. Even the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and bodily operations pertained in some respects to His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, inasmuch as it was His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> "that His flesh should do and suffer what belonged to it," as stated above (Question 18, Article 5). Much more, therefore, is there one operation in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, than in any other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whatsoever.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The operations of the sensitive and nutritive parts are not strictly <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, as stated above; yet in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> these operations were more <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> than in others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Powers and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are diversified by comparison with their objects. Hence in this way the diversity of operations corresponds to the divers powers and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, as likewise to the divers objects. Now we do not wish to exclude this diversity of operations from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> humanity, nor that which springs from a diversity of time, but only that which regards the first active principle, as was said above.

<p>(<a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> gives no reply to Objection 3; some codices add: Hence may be gathered the reply to the third objection.)

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the human action of Christ could be meritorious to Him?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> action of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> could not be <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> to Him. For before His death <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was a comprehensor even as He is now. But comprehensors do not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>: because the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of the comprehensor belongs to the reward of beatitude, since fruition depends upon it. Hence it does not seem to be the principle of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, since <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> and reward are not the same. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> before His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">passion</a> did not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, even as He does not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> now.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no one <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> what is due to him. But because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> inheritance is due to Him, which other men <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> by their works. And hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Who, from the beginning, was the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, could not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> anything for Himself.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whoever has the principle does not properly <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> what flows from its possession. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, whence, in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> course, flowed the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the body, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. ad Dios cxviii); though by a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> it was brought about that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> should not overflow to the body. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the body.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the manifestation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> excellence is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, not of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself, but of those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him. Hence it is promised as a reward to such as love Christ that He will be manifested to them, according to <a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse21">John 14:21</a>: "He that loveth Me, shall be loved of My Father, and I will love him and will manifest Myself to him." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> the manifestation of His greatness.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse8">Philippians 2:8-9</a>): "Becoming obedient unto death . . . For which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> also hath exalted Him." Therefore by obeying He <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> His exaltation and thus He <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> something for Himself.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> To have any <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thing of oneself is more excellent than to have it from another, for "what is of itself a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is always more excellent than what is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> through another," as is said Phys. viii, 5. Now a thing is said to have, of itself, that of which it is to some extent the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But of whatever <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> we possess the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> by authority is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and in this way no creature has any <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of itself, according to <a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse7">1 Corinthians 4:7</a>: "What hast thou that thou hast not received?" Nevertheless, in a secondary manner anyone may be a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, to himself, of having certain <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, inasmuch as he cooperates with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and thus whoever has anything by his own <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> has it, in a manner, of himself. Hence it is better to have a thing by <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> than without <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>.

<p>Now since all perfection and greatness must be attributed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, consequently He must have by <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> what others have by <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>; unless it be of such a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that its want would detract from Christ's dignity and perfection more than would accrue to Him by <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. Hence He <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> neither <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> nor <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> nor the beatitude of His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, nor the Godhead, because, since <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> regards only what is not yet possessed, it would be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should have been without these at some time; and to be without them would have diminished Christ's dignity more than His <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> would have increased it. But the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the body, and the like, are less than the dignity of meriting, which pertains to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Hence we must say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had, by <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His body and whatever pertained to His outward excellence, as His <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a>, veneration, and the rest. And thus it is clear that He could <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> for Himself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Fruition, which is an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, pertains to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. Hence if He <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, it does not follow that the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> and the reward are the same. Nor did He <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> inasmuch as it was the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of a comprehensor, but inasmuch as it was that of a wayfarer. For He was at once a wayfarer and a comprehensor, as was said above (Question 15, Article 10). And therefore, since He is no longer a wayfarer, He is not in the state of meriting.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Because by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, the Divine <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and the lordship of all things are due to Him, as to the first and supreme Lord. Nevertheless a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is due to Him as a beatified <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; and this He has partly without <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, and partly with <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, as is clear from what has been said.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is by Divine appointment that there is an overflow of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the body, in keeping with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>; so that as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> by the act of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which he performs in the body, so he may be rewarded by the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> overflowing to the body. And hence not only the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but also the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the body falls under <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse11">Romans 8:11</a>: "He . . . shall quicken also our [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'your'] mortal bodies, because of His Spirit that dwelleth in us [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'you']." And thus it could fall under <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The manifestation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> excellence is His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as regards the being which it has in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of others; although in regard to the being which they have in themselves it chiefly belongs to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him. Yet even this is referred to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> inasmuch as they are His members.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether Christ could merit for others?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> could not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> for others. For it is written (<a href="../bible/eze018.htm#verse4">Ezekiel 18:4</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinneth</a>, the same shall die." Hence, for a like reason, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that meriteth, the same shall be recompensed. Therefore it is not possible that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> for others.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, of the fulness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> we all receive, as is written <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse16">John 1:16</a>. Now other men having <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> for others. For it is written (<a href="../bible/eze014.htm#verse20">Ezekiel 14:20</a>) that if "<a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> and <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">Daniel</a> and <a href="../cathen/08413a.htm">Job</a> be in the city [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'the midst thereof'] . . . they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; but they shall only deliver their own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> by their <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>." Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> could not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> anything for us.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the "reward" that we <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> is due "according to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'debt'] and not according to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>," as is clear from <a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse4">Romans 4:4</a>. Therefore if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> it follows that our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is not by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> but by <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and that He acts <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> with those whom He does not save, since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> extends to all.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse18">Romans 5:18</a>): "As by the offense of one, unto all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to condemnation; so also by the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of one, unto all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to justification of life." But <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam's</a> demerits reached to the condemnation of others. Much more, therefore, does the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> reach others.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (8, 1,5), <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> not merely as in an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, but also as in the Head of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to Whom all are united, as members to a head, who constitute one mystical <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. And hence it is that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> extends to others inasmuch as they are His members; even as in a man the action of the head reaches in a manner to all his members, since it perceives not merely for itself alone, but for all the members.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> harms himself alone; but the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, who was appointed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be the principle of the whole <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, is transmitted to others by carnal propagation. So, too, the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who has been appointed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be the head of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in regard to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, extends to all His members.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Others receive of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> fulness not indeed the fount of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but some particular <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. And hence it need not be that men <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> for others, as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> reaches others only by carnal generation, so, too, the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> reaches others only by <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> regeneration, which takes place in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; wherein we are incorporated with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to <a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse27">Galatians 3:27</a>, "As many of you as have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, have put on Christ"; and it is by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that it is granted to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be incorporated with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And thus <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is from <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.
