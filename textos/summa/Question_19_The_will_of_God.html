<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether there is will in God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that there is not will in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the object of <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the end and the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But we cannot assign to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> any end. Therefore there is not will in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is a kind of <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. But <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, as it is directed to things not possessed, implies imperfection, which cannot be imputed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore there is not will in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Anima iii, 54), the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> moves, and is moved. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of movement, and Himself is unmoved, as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in Phys. viii, 49. Therefore there is not will in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse2">Romans 12:2</a>): "That you may <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> what is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There is will in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as there is <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>: since will follows upon <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. For as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things have actual <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> by their form, so the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is actually <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> by its intelligible form. Now everything has this aptitude towards its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> form, that when it has it not, it tends towards it; and when it has it, it is at rest therein. It is the same with every <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> perfection, which is a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. This aptitude to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in things without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is called <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Whence also <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> natures have a like aptitude as apprehended through its intelligible form; so as to rest therein when possessed, and when not possessed to seek to possess it, both of which pertain to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Hence in every <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> being there is will, just as in every sensible being there is animal <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. And so there must be will in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since there is <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in Him. And as His <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is His own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, so is His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although nothing apart from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is His end, yet He Himself is the end with respect to all things made by Him. And this by His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, for by His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> He is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as shown above (Question 6, Article 3): for the end has the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Will in us belongs to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> part, which, although named from <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, has not for its only act the seeking what it does not possess; but also the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> and the delighting in what it does possess. In this respect <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is said to be in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as having always <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is its object, since, as already said, it is not distinct from His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A will of which the principal object is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> outside itself, must be moved by another; but the object of the divine <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, which is His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Hence, since the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, it is not moved by another than itself, but by itself alone, in the same sense as understanding and willing are said to be movement. This is what <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> meant when he said that the first mover moves itself.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether God wills things apart from Himself?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not will things apart from Himself. For the divine <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not other than Himself. Therefore He does not will things other than Himself.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the willed moves the willer, as the appetible the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, as stated in De Anima iii, 54. If, therefore, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills anything apart from Himself, His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> must be moved by another; which is impossible.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if what is willed suffices the willer, he seeks nothing beyond it. But His own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> suffices <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and completely satisfies His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not will anything apart from Himself.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, acts of will are multiplied in proportion to the number of their objects. If, therefore, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills Himself and things apart from Himself, it follows that the act of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is manifold, and consequently His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, which is His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. But this is impossible. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not will things apart from Himself.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1th004.htm#verse3">1 Thessalonians 4:3</a>): "This is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, your sanctification."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills not only Himself, but other things apart from Himself. This is clear from the comparison which we made above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). For <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things have a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination not only towards their own proper <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, to acquire it if not possessed, and, if possessed, to rest therein; but also to spread abroad their own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> amongst others, so far as possible. Hence we see that every agent, in so far as it is perfect and in act, produces its like. It pertains, therefore, to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to communicate as far as possible to others the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> possessed; and especially does this pertain to the divine will, from which all perfection is derived in some kind of likeness. Hence, if <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things, in so far as they are perfect, communicate their <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to others, much more does it appertain to the divine will to communicate by likeness its own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to others as much as possible. Thus, then, He wills both Himself to be, and other things to be; but Himself as the end, and other things as ordained to that end; inasmuch as it befits the divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> that other things should be partakers therein.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The divine <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, yet they differ in aspect, according to the different ways of understanding them and expressing them, as is clear from what has already been said (13, 4). For when we say that <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">God exists</a>, no relation to any other object is implied, as we do imply when we say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills. Therefore, although He is not anything apart from Himself, yet He does will things apart from Himself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In things willed for the sake of the end, the whole reason for our being moved is the end, and this it is that moves the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as most clearly appears in things willed only for the sake of the end. He who wills to take a bitter draught, in doing so wills nothing else than health; and this alone moves his will. It is different with one who takes a draught that is pleasant, which anyone may will to do, not only for the sake of health, but also for its own sake. Hence, although <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills things apart from Himself only for the sake of the end, which is His own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, it does not follow that anything else moves His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, except His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. So, as He understands things apart from Himself by understanding His own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, so He wills things apart from Himself by willing His own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> From the fact that His own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> suffices the divine will, it does not follow that it wills nothing apart from itself, but rather that it wills nothing except by reason of its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Thus, too, the divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, though its perfection consists in its very <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, yet in that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> other things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As the divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is one, as seeing the many only in the one, in the same way the divine <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is one and simple, as willing the many only through the one, that is, through its own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether whatever God wills He wills necessarily?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that whatever <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills He wills <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a>. For everything <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. But whatever <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills, He wills from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, for otherwise His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> would be mutable. Therefore whatever He wills, He wills <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills things apart from Himself, inasmuch as He wills His own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills His own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a>. Therefore He wills things apart from Himself <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whatever belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is of Himself <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> being, and the principle of all <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, as above shown (2, 3). But it belongs to His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to will whatever He wills; since in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there can be nothing over and above His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as stated in Metaph. v, 6. Therefore whatever He wills, He wills <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, being that is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, and being that is possible not to be, are one and the same thing. If, therefore, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> will a thing that He wills, it is possible for Him not to will it, and therefore possible for Him to will what He does not will. And so the divine <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is contingent upon one or the other of two things, and imperfect, since everything contingent is imperfect and mutable.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, on the part of that which is indifferent to one or the other of two things, no action results unless it is inclined to one or the other by some other power, as the <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Commentator [Averroes]</a> says in Phys. ii. If, then, the Will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is indifferent with regard to anything, it follows that His determination to act comes from another; and thus He has some <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> prior to Himself.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, whatever <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a>. But as the divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, so is the divine will. Therefore whatever <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills, He wills <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse11">Ephesians 1:11</a>): "Who worketh all things according to the counsel of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>." Now, what we work according to the counsel of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, we do not will <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not will <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> whatever He wills.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There are two ways in which a thing is said to be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, namely, absolutely, and by supposition. We judge a thing to be absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> from the relation of the terms, as when the predicate forms part of the definition of the subject: thus it is absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is an animal. It is the same when the subject forms part of the notion of the predicate; thus it is absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that a number must be odd or even. In this way it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> sits: wherefore it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> absolutely, though it may be so by supposition; for, granted that he is sitting, he must <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> sit, as long as he is sitting. Accordingly as to things willed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we must observe that He wills something of absolute <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>: but this is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of all that He wills. For the divine will has a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> relation to the divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, since that is its proper object. Hence <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills His own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a>, even as we will our own <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a>, and as any other faculty has <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> relation to its proper and principal object, for instance the sight to color, since it tends to it by its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills things apart from Himself in so far as they are ordered to His own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> as their end. Now in willing an end we do not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> will things that conduce to it, unless they are such that the end cannot be attained without them; as, we will to take food to preserve life, or to take ship in order to cross the sea. But we do not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> will things without which the end is attainable, such as a horse for a journey which we can take on foot, for we can make the journey without one. The same applies to other means. Hence, since the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is perfect, and can <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> without other things inasmuch as no perfection can accrue to Him from them, it follows that His willing things apart from Himself is not absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Yet it can be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> by supposition, for supposing that He wills a thing, then He is unable not to will it, as His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> cannot change.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> From the fact that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> whatever He wills, it does not follow that He wills it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a>; except by supposition.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> wills His own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, He does not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> will things willed on account of His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>; for it can <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> without other things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to will any of those other things that He does not will <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a>; and yet it is not unnatural or contrary to His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Sometimes a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> has a non-<a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> relation to an effect; owing to a deficiency in the effect, and not in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Even so, the sun's power has a non-<a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> relation to some contingent events on this earth, owing to a defect not in the solar power, but in the effect that proceeds not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> from the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. In the same way, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> will some of the things that He wills, does not result from defect in the divine will, but from a defect belonging to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the thing willed, namely, that the perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can be without it; and such defect accompanies all <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> contingent <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> must be determined to act by some external power. The divine will, which by its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, determines itself to will things to which it has no <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> relation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> As the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> of itself, so is the divine will and the divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; but the divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> has a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> relation to the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; not the divine will to the thing willed. The reason for this is that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is of things as they <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the knower; but the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is directed to things as they <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in themselves. Since then all other things have <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> inasmuch as they <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but no absolute <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> so as to be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in themselves, in so far as they <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in themselves; it follows that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> whatever He wills, but does not will <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> whatever He wills.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the will of God is the cause of things?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of things. For <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv, 1): "As our sun, not by reason nor by pre-election, but by its very being, enlightens all things that can participate in its light, so the divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by its very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> pours the rays of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> upon everything that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>." But every <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> agent acts by reason and pre-election. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not act by will; and so His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of things.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, The first in any order is that which is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> so, thus in the order of burning things, that comes first which is fire by its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the first agent. Therefore He acts by His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; and that is His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. He acts then by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and not by will. Therefore the divine <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of things.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, Whatever is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of anything, through being "such" a thing, is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and not by will. For fire is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of heat, as being itself hot; whereas an architect is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a house, because he wills to build it. Now <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 32), "Because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, we <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of things by His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and not by His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, Of one thing there is one <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as said before (14, 8). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be considered the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of things.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/wis011.htm#verse26">Wisdom 11:26</a>), "How could anything endure, if Thou wouldst not?"

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We must hold that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of things; and that He acts by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and not, as some have supposed, by a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. This can be shown in three ways:

<p>First, from the order itself of active <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. Since both <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> act for an end, as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in Phys. ii, 49, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> agent must have the end and the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> means predetermined for it by some higher <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; as the end and definite movement is predetermined for the arrow by the archer. Hence the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> agent must precede the agent that acts by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence, since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is first in the order of agents, He must act by <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will.

<p>This is shown, secondly, from the character of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> agent, of which the property is to produce one and the same effect; for <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> operates in one and the same way unless it be prevented. This is because the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the act is according to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the agent; and hence as long as it has that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, its acts will be in accordance with that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; for every <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> agent has a determinate being. Since, then, the Divine Being is undetermined, and contains in Himself the full perfection of being, it cannot be that He acts by a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, unless He were to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> something undetermined and indefinite in being: and that this is impossible has been already shown (7, 2). He does not, therefore, act by a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but determined effects proceed from His own <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> perfection according to the determination of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p>Thirdly, it is shown by the relation of effects to their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. For effects proceed from the agent that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> them, in so far as they pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the agent; since every agent produces its like. Now effects pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> after the mode of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Wherefore since the Divine Being is His own <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, effects pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in Him after the mode of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and therefore proceed from Him after the same mode. Consequently, they proceed from Him after the mode of will, for His inclination to put in act what His <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> has conceived appertains to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> in these words does not intend to exclude election from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> absolutely; but only in a certain sense, in so far, that is, as He communicates His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> not merely to certain things, but to all; and as election implies a certain distinction.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Because the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is His <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will, from the fact of His acting by His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, it follows that He acts after the mode of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Good is the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. The words, therefore, "Because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, we <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>," are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> inasmuch as His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is the reason of His willing all other things, as said before (2, ad 2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Even in us the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of one and the same effect is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as directing it, whereby the form of the work is conceived, and will as commanding it, since the form as it is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> only is not determined to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> or not to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the effect, except by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Hence, the speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> has nothing to say to operation. But the power is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as executing the effect, since it denotes the immediate principle of operation. But in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> all these things are one.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether any cause can be assigned to the divine will?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that some <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> can be assigned to the divine <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Qq. lxxxiii, 46): "Who would venture to say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made all things irrationally?" But to a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> agent, what is the reason of operating, is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of willing. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has some <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in things made by one who wills to make them, and whose <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is influenced by no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, there can be no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> assigned except by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of him who wills. But the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all things, as has been already shown (4). If, then, there is no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, we cannot seek in any <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things any <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, except the divine will alone. Thus all science would be in vain, since science seeks to assign <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> to effects. This seems inadmissible, and therefore we must assign some <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to the divine will.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, what is done by the willer, on account of no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, depends simply on his will. If, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, it follows that all things made depend simply on His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and have no other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But this also is not admissible.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Qq. lxxxiii, 28): "Every efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is greater than the thing effected." But nothing is greater than the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. We must not then seek for a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of it.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In no wise has the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. In <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of which we must consider that, since the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> follows from the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, there is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who wills, in the same way as there is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the understanding, in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> that understands. The case with the understanding is this: that if the premiss and its conclusion are understood separately from each other, the understanding the premiss is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that the conclusion is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. If the understanding perceive the conclusion in the premiss itself, apprehending both the one and the other at the same glance, in this case the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> of the conclusion would not be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by understanding the premisses, since a thing cannot be its own <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; and yet, it would be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the thinker would understand the premisses to be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the conclusion. It is the same with the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, with respect to which the end stands in the same relation to the means to the end, as do the premisses to the conclusion with regard to the understanding.

<p>Hence, if anyone in one act wills an end, and in another act the means to that end, his willing the end will be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of his willing the means. This cannot be the case if in one act he wills both end and means; for a thing cannot be its own <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Yet it will be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to say that he wills to order to the end the means to the end. Now as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by one act understands all things in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, so by one act He wills all things in His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Hence, as in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to understand the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of His understanding the effect, for He understands the effect in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, so, in Him, to will an end is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of His willing the means, yet He wills the ordering of the means to the end. Therefore, He wills this to be as means to that; but does not will this on account of that.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is reasonable, not because anything is to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of willing, but in so far as He wills one thing to be on account of another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills effects to proceed from definite <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, for the preservation of order in the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, it is not unreasonable to seek for <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> secondary to the divine will. It would, however, be unreasonable to do so, if such were considered as primary, and not as dependent on the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In this sense <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iii, 2): "Philosophers in their vanity have thought fit to attribute contingent effects to other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, being utterly unable to perceive the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that is shown above all others, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills effects to come from <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, all effects that presuppose some other effect do not depend solely on the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but on something else besides: but the first effect depends on the divine will alone. Thus, for example, we may say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> willed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to have hands to serve his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> by their work, and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, that he might be <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; and willed him to be <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that he might enjoy Him, or for the completion of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. But this cannot be reduced to other <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> secondary ends. Hence such things depend on the simple will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but the others on the order of other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the will of God is always fulfilled?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not always fulfilled. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse4">1 Timothy 2:4</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will have all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to be saved, and to come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." But this does not happen. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not always fulfilled.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as is the relation of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, so is that of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Therefore He wills all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But not all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> actually <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>; for much more <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> might <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not always fulfilled.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, since the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, it does not exclude intermediate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. But the effect of a first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> may be hindered by a defect of a secondary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; as the effect of the motive power may be hindered by the weakness of the limb. Therefore the effect of the divine will may be hindered by a defect of the secondary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. The will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, therefore, is not always fulfilled.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/psa113.htm#verse11">Psalm 13:11</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath done all things, whatsoever He would."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> must needs always be fulfilled. In <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of which we must consider that since an effect is conformed to the agent according to its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, the rule is the same with active <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> as with <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">formal</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. The rule in forms is this: that although a thing may fall short of any particular form, it cannot fall short of the universal form. For though a thing may fail to be, for example, a man or a living being, yet it cannot fail to be a being. Hence the same must happen in active <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. Something may fall outside the order of any particular active <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but not outside the order of the universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; under which all particular <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> are included: and if any particular <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> fails of its effect, this is because of the hindrance of some other particular <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, which is included in the order of the universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Therefore an effect cannot possibly escape the order of the universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Even in corporeal things this is clearly seen. For it may happen that a star is hindered from producing its effects; yet whatever effect does result, in corporeal things, from this hindrance of a corporeal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, must be referred through intermediate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> to the universal influence of the first <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Since, then, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all things, it is impossible that the divine will should not produce its effect. Hence that which seems to depart from the divine will in one order, returns into it in another order; as does the sinner, who by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> falls away from the divine will as much as lies in him, yet falls back into the order of that will, when by its <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> he is punished.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The words of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will have all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to be saved," etc. can be understood in three ways.

<p>First, by a restricted application, in which case they would mean, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De praed. sanct. i, 8: Enchiridion 103), "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to be saved that are saved, not because there is no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whom He does not wish saved, but because there is no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> saved whose <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> He does not will."

<p>Secondly, they can be understood as applying to every class of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, not to every <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> of each class; in which case they mean that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills some men of every class and <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> to be saved, males and females, <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, great and small, but not all of every <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>.

<p>Thirdly, according to <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. ii, 29), they are understood of the antecedent will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; not of the consequent will. This distinction must not be taken as applying to the divine will itself, in which there is nothing antecedent nor consequent, but to the things willed.

<p>To understand this we must consider that everything, in so far as it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, is willed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. A thing taken in its primary sense, and absolutely considered, may be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and yet when some additional circumstances are taken into account, by a consequent consideration may be changed into the contrary. Thus that a man should live is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and that a man should be killed is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, absolutely considered. But if in a particular case we add that a man is a murderer or dangerous to society, to kill him is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; that he live is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Hence it may be said of a just judge, that antecedently he wills all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to live; but consequently wills the murderer to be hanged. In the same way <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> antecedently wills all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to be saved, but consequently wills some to be damned, as His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> exacts. Nor do we will simply, what we will antecedently, but rather we will it in a qualified manner; for the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is directed to things as they are in themselves, and in themselves they <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> under particular qualifications. Hence we will a thing simply inasmuch as we will it when all particular circumstances are considered; and this is what is meant by willing consequently. Thus it may be said that a just judge wills simply the hanging of a murderer, but in a qualified manner he would will him to live, to wit, inasmuch as he is a man. Such a qualified will may be called a willingness rather than an absolute will. Thus it is clear that whatever <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> simply wills takes place; although what He wills antecedently may not take place.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> An act of the cognitive faculty is according as the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> is in the knower; while an act of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> faculty is directed to things as they <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in themselves. But all that can have the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of being and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> virtually <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, though it does not all <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; but does not will all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, except in so far as He wills Himself, in Whom all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> virtually <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> can be hindered in its effect by deficiency in the secondary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, when it is not the universal first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, including within itself all <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>; for then the effect could in no way escape its order. And thus it is with the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as said above.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the will of God is changeable?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the Will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is changeable. For the Lord says (<a href="../bible/gen006.htm#verse7">Genesis 6:7</a>): "It repenteth Me that I have made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." But whoever repents of what he has done, has a changeable will. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has a changeable will.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is said in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Lord: "I will speak against a nation and against a kingdom, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy it; but if that nation shall repent of its <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, I also will repent of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that I have thought to do to them" (<a href="../bible/jer018.htm#verse7">Jeremiah 18:7-8</a>) Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has a changeable will.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whatever <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does, He does <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not always do the same thing, for at one time He ordered the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to be observed, and at another time forbade it. Therefore He has a changeable will.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not will of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> what He wills, as said before (3). Therefore He can both will and not will the same thing. But whatever can incline to either of two opposites, is changeable substantially; and that which can <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in a place or not in that place, is changeable locally. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is changeable as regards His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not as a man, that He should lie, nor as the son of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that He should be changed" (<a href="../bible/num023.htm#verse19">Numbers 23:19</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is entirely unchangeable. On this point we must consider that to change the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is one thing; to will that certain things should be changed is another. It is possible to will a thing to be done now, and its contrary afterwards; and yet for the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to remain permanently the same: whereas the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> would be changed, if one should begin to will what before he had not willed; or cease to will what he had willed before. This cannot happen, unless we presuppose change either in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or in the disposition of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the willer. For since the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> regards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, a man may in two ways begin to will a thing. In one way when that thing begins to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for him, and this does not take place without a change in him. Thus when the cold weather begins, it becomes <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to sit by the fire; though it was not so before. In another way when he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> for the first time that a thing is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for him, though he did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it before; hence we take counsel in order to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for us. Now it has already been shown that both the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> are entirely unchangeable (9, 1; 14, 15). Therefore His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> must be entirely unchangeable.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> These words of the Lord are to be understood metaphorically, and according to the likeness of our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For when we repent, we destroy what we have made; although we may even do so without change of will; as, when a man wills to make a thing, at the same time intending to destroy it later. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said to have repented, by way of comparison with our mode of acting, in so far as by the <a href="../cathen/04702a.htm">deluge</a> He destroyed from the face of the earth <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whom He had made.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as it is the first and universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, does not exclude intermediate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> that have power to produce certain effects. Since however all intermediate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> are inferior in power to the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, there are many things in the divine power, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and will that are not included in the order of inferior <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. Thus in the case of the raising of <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a>, one who looked only on inferior <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> might have said: "<a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a> will not rise again," but looking at the divine first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> might have said: "<a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a> will rise again." And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills both: that is, that in the order of the inferior <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a thing shall happen; but that in the order of the higher <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> it shall not happen; or He may will conversely. We may say, then, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sometimes declares that a thing shall happen according as it falls under the order of inferior <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, as of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, or <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, which yet does not happen as not being in the designs of the divine and higher <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Thus He foretold to <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a>: "Take order with thy house, for thou shalt die, and not live" (<a href="../bible/isa038.htm#verse1">Isaiah 38:1</a>). Yet this did not take place, since from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> it was otherwise disposed in the divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and will, which is unchangeable. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xvi, 5): "The sentence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> changes, but not His counsel"--that is to say, the counsel of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. When therefore He says, "I also will repent," His words must be understood metaphorically. For men seem to repent, when they do not fulfill what they have threatened.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It does not follow from this argument that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has a will that changes, but that He sometimes wills that things should change.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> willing a thing is not by absolute <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, yet it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> by supposition, on account of the unchangeableness of the divine will, as has been said above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>).

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether the will of God imposes necessity on the things willed?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> imposes <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> on the things willed. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion 103): "No one is saved, except whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has willed to be saved. He must therefore be asked to will it; for if He wills it, it must <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> be."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that cannot be hindered, produces its effect <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a>, because, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Phys. ii, 84) "Nature always works in the same way, if there is nothing to hinder it." But the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be hindered. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse19">Romans 9:19</a>): "Who resisteth His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>?" Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> imposes <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> on the things willed.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whatever is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> by its antecedent <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> absolutely; it is thus <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that animals should die, being compounded of contrary elements. Now things <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are related to the divine will as to an antecedent <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, whereby they have <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. For the conditional statement is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills a thing, it comes to pass; and every <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> conditional statement is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. It follows therefore that all that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> absolutely.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> All <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills to be. If therefore His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> imposes <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> on things willed, it follows that all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> happens of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>; and thus there is an end of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, counsel, and all other such things.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The divine will imposes <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> on some things willed but not on all. The reason of this some have chosen to assign to intermediate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, holding that what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> produces by <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>; and what He produces by contingent <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/04331a.htm">contingent</a>. This does not seem to be a sufficient explanation, for two reasons.

<p>First, because the effect of a first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is contingent on account of the secondary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, from the fact that the effect of the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is hindered by deficiency in the second <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as the sun's power is hindered by a defect in the plant. But no defect of a secondary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> can hinder <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will from producing its effect.

<p>Secondly, because if the distinction between the contingent and the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> is to be referred only to secondary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, this must be independent of the divine <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> and will; which is inadmissible. It is better therefore to say that this happens on account of the efficacy of the divine will. For when a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is efficacious to act, the effect follows upon the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, not only as to the thing done, but also as to its manner of being done or of being. Thus from defect of active power in the seed it may happen that a child is born unlike its father in <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> points, that belong to its manner of being. Since then the divine <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is perfectly efficacious, it follows not only that things are done, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills to be done, but also that they are done in the way that He wills. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills some things to be done <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a>, some contingently, to the right ordering of things, for the building up of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. Therefore to some effects He has attached <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, that cannot fail; but to others defectible and contingent <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, from which arise contingent effects. Hence it is not because the proximate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> are contingent that the effects willed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> happen contingently, but because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> prepared contingent <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> for them, it being His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> that they should happen contingently.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> By the words of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> we must understand a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> in things willed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that is not absolute, but conditional. For the conditional statement that if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills a thing it must <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> be, is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> From the very fact that nothing resists the divine will, it follows that not only those things happen that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills to happen, but that they happen <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> or contingently according to His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Consequents have <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> from their antecedents according to the mode of the antecedents. Hence things effected by the divine will have that kind of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills them to have, either absolute or conditional. Not all things, therefore, are absolute necessities.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether God wills evils?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. For every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills. But it is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> should <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion 95): "Although <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in so far as it is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, yet it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that not only <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things should <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, but also <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv, 23): "<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">Evil</a> would conduce to the perfection of everything," i.e. the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. And <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion 10,11): "Out of all things is built up the admirable beauty of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, wherein even that which is called <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, properly ordered and disposed, commends the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> more evidently in that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is more pleasing and praiseworthy when contrasted with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills all that appertains to the perfection and beauty of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, for this is what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> desires above all things in His creatures. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> should <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, and should not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, are contradictory opposites. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not will that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> should not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>; otherwise, since various <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> do <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will would not always be fulfilled. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> should <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Qq. 83,3): "No wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> becoming worse. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> surpasses all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in wisdom. Much less therefore is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> becoming worse; and when He is said to be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a thing, He is said to will it." Therefore it is not by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> becomes worse. Now it is clear that every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> makes a thing worse. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since the ratio of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is the ratio of appetibility, as said before (5, 1), and since <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is opposed to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it is impossible that any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as such, should be sought for by the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, either <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, or animal, or by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> which is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Nevertheless <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> may be sought <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, so far as it accompanies a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as appears in each of the appetites. For a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> agent intends not privation or corruption, but the form to which is annexed the privation of some other form, and the generation of one thing, which implies the corruption of another. Also when a lion kills a stag, his object is food, to obtain which the killing of the animal is only the means. Similarly the fornicator has merely pleasure for his object, and the deformity of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is only an accompaniment. Now the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that accompanies one <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, is the privation of another <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Never therefore would <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> be sought after, not even <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, unless the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that accompanies the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> were more desired than the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of which the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is the privation. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills no <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> more than He wills His own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>; yet He wills one <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> more than another. Hence He in no way wills the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is the privation of right order towards the divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> defect, or of punishment, He does will, by willing the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to which such <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> are attached. Thus in willing <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> He wills punishment; and in willing the preservation of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order, He wills some things to be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> corrupted.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Some have said that although <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not will <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, yet He wills that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> should be or be done, because, although <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, yet it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> should be or be done. This they said because things <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in themselves are ordered to some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> end; and this order they thought was expressed in the words "that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> should be or be done." This, however, is not correct; since <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not of itself ordered to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>. For it is beside the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the sinner, that any <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> should follow from his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; as it was beside the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of tyrants that the patience of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> should shine forth from all their <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>. It cannot therefore be said that such an ordering to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is implied in the statement that it is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thing that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> should be or be done, since nothing is judged of by that which appertains to it <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, but by that which belongs to it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">Evil</a> does not operate towards the perfection and beauty of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, except <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, as said above (ad 1). Therefore <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> in saying that "<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> would conduce to the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>," draws a conclusion by reduction to an absurdity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The statements that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>, and that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> not, are opposed as contradictories; yet the statements that anyone wills <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> and that he wills it not to be, are not so opposed; since either is affirmative. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> therefore neither wills <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to be done, nor wills it not to be done, but wills to permit <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to be done; and this is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether God has free-will?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has not <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says, in a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> on the prodigal son [Ep. 146, ad Damas.]; "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is He who is not liable to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, nor can be liable: all others, as having <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, can be inclined to either side."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is the faculty of the reason and will, by which <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> are chosen. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not will <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as has been said (9). Therefore there is not <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Fide ii, 3): "The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> divideth unto each one as He will, namely, according to the free choice of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, not in obedience to <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We have <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> with respect to what we will not of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, nor be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a>. For our will to be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> does not appertain to <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, but to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a>. Hence other animals, that are moved to act by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a>, are not said to be moved by <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. Since then <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> wills His own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, but other things not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a>, as shown above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), He has <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> with respect to what He does not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> will.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> seems to deny <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> not simply, but only as regards the inclination to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Since the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> consists in turning away from the divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, by which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills all things, as above shown (De Fide ii, 3), it is manifestly impossible for Him to will the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; yet He can make choice of one of two opposites, inasmuch as He can will a thing to be, or not to be. In the same way we ourselves, without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, can will to sit down, and not will to sit down.

<h2 id="article11">Article 11. Whether the will of expression is to be distinguished in God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of expression is not to be distinguished in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For as the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of things, so is His wisdom. But no expressions are assigned to the divine wisdom. Therefore no expressions ought to be assigned to the divine will.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every expression that is not in agreement with the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of him who expresses himself, is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. If therefore the expressions assigned to the divine will are not in agreement with that will, they are <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. But if they do agree, they are superfluous. No expressions therefore must be assigned to the divine will.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is one, since it is the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Yet sometimes it is spoken of as many, as in the words of <a href="../bible/psa110.htm#verse2">Psalm 110:2</a>: "Great are the works of the Lord, sought out according to all His wills." Therefore sometimes the sign must be taken for the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some things are said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in their strict sense; others by metaphor, as appears from what has been said before (13, 3). When certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are predicated of the Godhead metaphorically, this is done because of a likeness in the effect. Hence a thing that is in us a sign of some passion, is signified metaphorically in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> under the name of that passion. Thus with us it is usual for an <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to punish, so that punishment becomes an expression of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. Therefore punishment itself is signified by the word <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, when <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In the same way, what is usually with us an expression of will, is sometimes metaphorically called will in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; just as when anyone lays down a precept, it is a sign that he wishes that precept obeyed. Hence a divine precept is sometimes called by metaphor the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as in the words: "Thy will be done on earth, as it is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>" (<a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse10">Matthew 6:10</a>). There is, however, this difference between will and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is never attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> properly, since in its primary meaning it includes passion; whereas <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is attributed to Him properly. Therefore in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there are distinguished will in its proper sense, and will as attributed to Him by metaphor. Will in its proper sense is called the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> pleasure; and will metaphorically taken is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of expression, inasmuch as the sign itself of <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is called will.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowledge</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a thing being done, unless through the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. For we do not put into act what we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, unless we will to do so. Accordingly expression is not attributed to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but to will.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Expressions of will are called divine wills, not as being signs that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills anything; but because what in us is the usual expression of our will, is called the divine will in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Thus punishment is not a sign that there is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but it is called <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> in Him, from the fact that it is an expression of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> in ourselves.

<h2 id="article12">Article 12. Whether five expressions of will are rightly assigned to the divine will?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that five expressions of will--namely, prohibition, precept, counsel, operation, and permission--are not rightly assigned to the divine will. For the same things that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> bids us do by His precept or counsel, these He sometimes operates in us, and the same things that He prohibits, these He sometimes permits. They ought not therefore to be enumerated as distinct.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> works nothing unless He wills it, as the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> says (<a href="../bible/wis011.htm#verse26">Wisdom 11:26</a>). But the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of expression is distinct from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> pleasure. Therefore operation ought not to be comprehended in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of expression.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, operation and permission appertain to all creatures in common, since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> works in them all, and permits some action in them all. But precept, counsel, and prohibition belong to rational creatures only. Therefore they do not come rightly under one division, not being of one order.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> happens in more ways than <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> happens in one way, but <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in all kinds of ways," as declared by the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. ii, 6), and <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. iv, 22). It is not right therefore to assign one expression only in the case of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>--namely, prohibition--and two--namely, counsel and precept--in the case of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> By these signs we name the expression of will by which we are accustomed to show that we will something. A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may show that he wills something, either by himself or by means of another. He may show it by himself, by doing something either directly, or indirectly and <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>. He shows it directly when he works in his own <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; in that way the expression of his <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is his own working. He shows it indirectly, by not hindering the doing of a thing; for what removes an impediment is called an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> mover. In this respect the expression is called permission. He declares his will by means of another when he orders another to perform a work, either by insisting upon it as <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> by precept, and by prohibiting its contrary; or by persuasion, which is a part of counsel. Since in these ways the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> makes itself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, the same five are sometimes denominated with regard to the divine will, as the expression of that will. That precept, counsel, and prohibition are called the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is clear from the words of <a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse10">Matthew 6:10</a>: "Thy will be done on earth as it is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>." That permission and operation are called the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is clear from <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Enchiridion 95), who says: "Nothing is done, unless the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty</a> wills it to be done, either by permitting it, or by actually doing it."

<p>Or it may be said that permission and operation refer to present time, permission being with respect to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, operation with regard to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Whilst as to future time, prohibition is in respect to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, precept to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> and counsel to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that is of supererogation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> There is nothing to prevent anyone declaring his will about the same <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in different ways; thus we find many words that mean the same thing. Hence there is not reason why the same thing should not be the subject of precept, operation, and counsel; or of prohibition or permission.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may by metaphor be said to will what by His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, properly speaking, He wills not; so He may by metaphor be said to will what He does, properly speaking, will. Hence there is nothing to prevent the same thing being the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> pleasure, and of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of expression. But operation is always the same as the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> pleasure; while precept and counsel are not; both because the former regards the present, and the two latter the future; and because the former is of itself the effect of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; the latter its effect as fulfilled by means of another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Rational creatures are masters of their own acts; and for this reason certain special expressions of the divine will are assigned to their acts, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> ordains rational creatures to act <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> and of themselves. Other creatures act only as moved by the divine operation; therefore only operation and permission are concerned with these.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> All <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, though happening in many ways, agrees in being out of harmony with the divine will. Hence with regard to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, only one expression is assigned, that of prohibition. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> stands in various relations to the divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, since there are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> without which we cannot attain to the fruition of that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, and these are the subject of precept; and there are others by which we attain to it more perfectly, and these are the subject of counsel. Or it may be said that counsel is not only concerned with the obtaining of greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; but also with the avoiding of lesser <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>.
