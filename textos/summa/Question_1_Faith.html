<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the object of faith is the First Truth?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not the First Truth. For it seems that the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is that which is proposed to us to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. Now not only things pertaining to the Godhead, i.e. the First Truth, are proposed to us to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, but also things concerning <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of creatures. Therefore the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not only the First Truth.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and unbelief have the same object since they are opposed to one another. Now unbelief can be about all things contained in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>, for whichever one of them a man denies, he is considered an unbeliever. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> also is about all things contained in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>. But there are many things therein, concerning <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and other creatures. Therefore the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not only the First Truth, but also <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is condivided with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as stated above (I-II, 62, 3). Now by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> we love not only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is the sovereign Good, but also our neighbor. Therefore the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> is not only the First Truth.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. vii) that "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is about the simple and everlasting <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." Now this is the First Truth. Therefore the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the First Truth.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The object of every cognitive <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> includes two things: first, that which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> materially, and is the material object, so to speak, and, secondly, that whereby it is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, which is the formal aspect of the object. Thus in the science of geometry, the conclusions are what is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> materially, while the formal aspect of the science is the mean of demonstration, through which the conclusions are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.

<p>Accordingly if we consider, in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the formal aspect of the object, it is nothing else than the First Truth. For the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of which we are speaking, does not assent to anything, except because it is <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence the mean on which <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is based is the Divine Truth. If, however, we consider materially the things to which <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> assents, they include not only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but also many other things, which, nevertheless, do not come under the assent of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, except as bearing some relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in as much as, to wit, through certain effects of the Divine operation, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is helped on his journey towards the enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Consequently from this point of view also the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is, in a way, the First Truth, in as much as nothing comes under <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> except in relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even as the object of the medical art is health, for it considers nothing save in relation to health.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Things concerning <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or any creatures whatever, come under <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in so far as by them we are directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in as much as we assent to them on account of the Divine Truth.

<p>The same answer applies to the Second Objection, as regards all things contained in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> also loves our neighbor on account of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so that its object, properly speaking, is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as we shall show further on (25, 1).

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the object of faith is something complex, by way of a proposition?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not something complex by way of a proposition. For the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the First Truth, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Now the First Truth is something simple. Therefore the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not something complex.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the exposition of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is contained in the symbol. Now the symbol does not contain propositions, but things: for it is not stated therein that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is almighty, but: "I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> . . . almighty." Therefore the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not a proposition but a thing.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is succeeded by vision, according to <a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>: "We see now through a glass in a dark manner; but then face to face. Now I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in part; but then I shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> even as I am <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>." But the object of the heavenly vision is something simple, for it is the Divine Essence. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the wayfarer is also.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> is a mean between science and opinion. Now the mean is in the same genus as the extremes. Since, then, science and opinion are about propositions, it seems that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is likewise about propositions; so that its object is something complex.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> is in the knower according to the mode of the knower. Now the mode proper to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by synthesis and analysis, as stated in I, 85, 5. Hence things that are simple in themselves, are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> with a certain amount of complexity, just as on the other hand, the Divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, without any complexity, things that are complex in themselves.

<p>Accordingly the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> may be considered in two ways. First, as regards the thing itself which is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and thus the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is something simple, namely the thing itself about which we have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Secondly, on the part of the believer, and in this respect the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is something complex by way of a proposition.

<p>Hence in the past both opinions have been held with a certain amount of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument considers the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> on the part of the thing <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The symbol mentions the things about which <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is, in so far as the act of the believer is terminated in them, as is evident from the manner of speaking about them. Now the act of the believer does not terminate in a proposition, but in a thing. For as in science we do not form propositions, except in order to have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> about things through their means, so is it in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The object of the heavenly vision will be the First Truth seen in itself, according to <a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse2">1 John 3:2</a>: "We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that when He shall appear, we shall be like to Him: because we shall see Him as He is": hence that vision will not be by way of a proposition but by way of a simple understanding. On the other hand, by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, we do not apprehend the First Truth as it is in itself. Hence the comparison fails.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether anything false can come under faith?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that something <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> can come under <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is condivided with hope and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Now something <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> can come under hope, since many hope to have <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, who will not obtain it. The same may be said of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, for many are loved as being <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, who, nevertheless, are not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore something <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> can be the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> would be born, according to <a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse56">John 8:56</a>: "<a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> your father rejoiced that he might see My day: he saw it, and was glad." But after the time of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> might not have taken flesh, for it was merely because He willed that He did, so that what <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> about <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> would have been <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Therefore the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> can be something <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the ancients <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the future birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and many continued so to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, until they heard the preaching of the Gospel. Now, when once <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was born, even before He began to preach, it was <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was yet to be born. Therefore something <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> can come under <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it is a matter of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that one should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is contained in the Sacrament of the altar. But it might happen that the bread was not rightly <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, and that there was not <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Body there, but only bread. Therefore something <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> can come under <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> No <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that perfects the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is related to the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, considered as the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> declares (Ethic. vi, 2). Now <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that perfects the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as we shall show further on (4, 2,5). Therefore nothing <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> can come under it.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Nothing comes under any power, <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> or act, except by means of the formal aspect of the object: thus color cannot be seen except by means of light, and a conclusion cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> save through the mean of demonstration. Now it has been stated (1) that the formal aspect of the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the First Truth; so that nothing can come under <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, save in so far as it stands under the First Truth, under which nothing <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> can stand, as neither can non-being stand under being, nor <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> under <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. It follows therefore that nothing <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> can come under <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Since the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, but not of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, it follows that all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which perfect the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, exclude the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> altogether, because it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to bear relation to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> alone. On the other hand those <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which perfect the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> faculty, do not entirely exclude the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, for it is possible to act in accordance with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> or <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, while having a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinion about what one is doing. Therefore, as <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> perfects the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, whereas hope and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> perfect the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> part, the comparison between them fails.

<p>Nevertheless neither can anything <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> come under hope, for a man hopes to obtain <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, not by his own power (since this would be an act of presumption), but with the help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; and if he perseveres therein he will obtain <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> surely and infallibly.

<p>In like manner it belongs to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, wherever He may be; so that it matters not to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, whether <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be in the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> whom we love for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> That "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would not take flesh," considered in itself was possible even after <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> time, but in so far as it stands in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> foreknowledge, it has a certain <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of infallibility, as explained in I, 14, 13 and 15: and it is thus that it comes under <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Hence in so far as it comes under <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, it cannot be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> After <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth, to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, was to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth at some time or other. The fixing of the time, wherein some were deceived was not due to their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> conjecture. For it is possible for a believer to have a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinion through a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> conjecture, but it is quite impossible for a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinion to be the outcome of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the believer is not directed to such and such <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> of bread, but to the fact that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is under the appearances of sensible bread, when it is rightly <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>. Hence if it be not rightly <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, it does not follow that anything <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> comes under <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the object of faith can be something seen?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is something seen. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said to Thomas (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse29">John 20:29</a>): "Because thou hast seen Me, Thomas, thou hast <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>." Therefore vision and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> regard the same object.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>, while speaking of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, says (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>): "We see now through a glass in a dark manner." Therefore what is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> is seen.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> light. Now something is seen under every light. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is of things seen.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, "Every sense is a kind of sight," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Verb. Domini, Serm. xxxiii). But <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is of things heard, according to <a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse17">Romans 10:17</a>: "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> . . . cometh by hearing." Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is of things seen.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse1">Hebrews 11:1</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the evidence of things that appear not."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> implies assent of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to that which is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> assents to a thing in two ways. First, through being moved to assent by its very object, which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> either by itself (as in the case of first principles, which are held by the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of understanding), or through something else already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> (as in the case of conclusions which are held by the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of science). Secondly the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> assents to something, not through being sufficiently moved to this assent by its proper object, but through an act of choice, whereby it turns <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> to one side rather than to the other: and if this be accompanied by <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> or fear of the opposite side, there will be opinion, while, if there be <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> and no fear of the other side, there will be <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p>Now those things are said to be seen which, of themselves, move the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> or the senses to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of them. Wherefore it is evident that neither <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> nor opinion can be of things seen either by the senses or by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Thomas "saw one thing, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> another" [<a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a>: Hom. xxvi in Evang.]: he saw the Man, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> Him to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he made profession of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, saying: "My Lord and my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Those things which come under <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> can be considered in two ways. First, in particular; and thus they cannot be seen and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> at the same time, as shown above. Secondly, in general, that is, under the common aspect of credibility; and in this way they are seen by the believer. For he would not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> unless, on the evidence of signs, or of something similar, he saw that they ought to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The light of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> makes us see what we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. For just as, by the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> sees what is becoming to him in respect of that <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, so, by the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind is directed to assent to such things as are becoming to a right <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and not to assent to others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Hearing is of words signifying what is of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but not of the things themselves that are <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>; hence it does not follow that these things are seen.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether those things that are of faith can be an object of science [Science is certain knowledge of a demonstrated conclusion through its demonstration]?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that those things that are of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> can be an object of science. For where science is lacking there is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, since <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is the opposite of science. Now we are not in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of those things we have to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, since <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of such things savors of unbelief, according to <a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse13">1 Timothy 1:13</a>: "I did it ignorantly in unbelief." Therefore things that are of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> can be an object of science.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, science is acquired by reasons. Now sacred writers employ reasons to inculcate things that are of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Therefore such things can be an object of science.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, things which are demonstrated are an object of science, since a "demonstration is a syllogism that produces science." Now certain matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> have been demonstrated by the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, such as the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">Existence</a> and Unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and so forth. Therefore things that are of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> can be an object of science.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, opinion is further from science than <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is, since <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is said to stand between opinion and science. Now opinion and science can, in a way, be about the same object, as stated in Poster. i. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and science can be about the same object also.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xxvi in Evang.) that "when a thing is manifest, it is the object, not of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but of perception." Therefore things that are of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are not the object of perception, whereas what is an object of science is the object of perception. Therefore there can be no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> about things which are an object of science.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> All science is derived from self-evident and therefore "seen" principles; wherefore all objects of science must needs be, in a fashion, seen.

<p>Now as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>), it is impossible that one and the same thing should be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> and seen by the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Hence it is equally impossible for one and the same thing to be an object of science and of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> for the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. It may happen, however, that a thing which is an object of vision or science for one, is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> by another: since we hope to see some day what we now <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> about the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>: "We see now through a glass in a dark manner; but then face to face": which vision the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> possess already; so that what we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, they see. On like manner it may happen that what is an object of vision or scientific <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> for one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, even in the state of a wayfarer, is, for another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, an object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, because he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it by demonstration.

<p>Nevertheless that which is proposed to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> equally by all, is equally unknown by all as an object of science: such are the things which are of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> simply. Consequently <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and science are not about the same things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Unbelievers are in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of things that are of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, for neither do they see or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them in themselves, nor do they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them to be credible. The faithful, on the other hand, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them, not as by demonstration, but by the light of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which makes them see that they ought to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them, as stated above (4, ad 2,3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The reasons employed by <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> things that are of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, are not demonstrations; they are either persuasive arguments showing that what is proposed to our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not impossible, or else they are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> drawn from the principles of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, i.e. from the authority of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> declares (Div. Nom. ii). Whatever is based on these principles is as well <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, as a conclusion drawn from self-evident principles is in the eyes of all. Hence again, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> is a science, as we stated at the outset of this work (I, 1, 2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Things which can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by demonstration are reckoned among the <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a>, not because they are <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> simply by all, but because they are a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> presupposition to matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so that those who do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> them by demonstration must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them first of all by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Poster. i), "science and opinion about the same object can certainly be in different men," as we have stated above about science and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; yet it is possible for one and the same <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to have science and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> about the same thing relatively, i.e. in relation to the object, but not in the same respect. For it is possible for the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, about one and the same object, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> one thing and to think another: and, in like manner, one may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by demonstration the unity of the Godhead, and, by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>. On the other hand, in one and the same <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, about the same object, and in the same respect, science is incompatible with either opinion or <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, yet for different reasons. Because science is incompatible with opinion about the same object simply, for the reason that science demands that its object should be deemed impossible to be otherwise, whereas it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to opinion, that its object should be deemed possible to be otherwise. Yet that which is the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, on account of the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, is also deemed impossible to be otherwise; and the reason why science and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> cannot be about the same object and in the same respect is because the object of science is something seen whereas the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the unseen, as stated above.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether those things that are of faith should be divided into certain articles?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that those things that are of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> should not be divided into certain articles. For all things contained in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> are matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But these, by reason of their multitude, cannot be reduced to a certain number. Therefore it seems superfluous to distinguish certain <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, material differences can be multiplied indefinitely, and therefore art should take no notice of them. Now the formal aspect of the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is one and indivisible, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), viz. the First Truth, so that matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> cannot be distinguished in respect of their formal object. Therefore no notice should be taken of a material division of matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> into articles.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it has been said by some [Cf. <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">William of Auxerre</a>, Summa Aurea] that "an article is an indivisible <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, exacting [arctans] our <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> act, since, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. xxvi in Joan.), "no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> against his will." Therefore it seems that matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> should not be divided into articles.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says: "An article is a glimpse of Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, tending thereto." Now we can only get a glimpse of Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by way of analysis, since things which in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are one, are manifold in our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> should be divided into articles.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> the word "article" is apparently derived from the Greek; for the Greek <em>arthron</em> [Cf. <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">William of Auxerre</a>, Summa Aurea] which the <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> renders "articulus," signifies a fitting together of distinct parts: wherefore the small parts of the body which fit together are called the articulations of the limbs. Likewise, in the Greek grammar, articles are parts of speech which are affixed to words to show their gender, number or case. Again in rhetoric, articles are parts that fit together in a sentence, for Tully says (Rhet. iv) that an article is composed of words each pronounced singly and separately, thus: "Your passion, your voice, your look, have struck terror into your foes."

<p>Hence matters of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are said to contain distinct articles, in so far as they are divided into parts, and fit together. Now the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is something unseen in connection with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>). Consequently any <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> that, for a special reason, is unseen, is a special article; whereas when several matters are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> or not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, under the same aspect, we are not to distinguish various articles. Thus one encounters one difficulty in seeing that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> suffered, and another in seeing that He rose again from the dead, wherefore the article of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> is distinct from the article of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. But that He suffered, died and was buried, present the same difficulty, so that if one be accepted, it is not difficult to accept the others; wherefore all these belong to one article.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Some things are proposed to our <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> are in themselves of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, while others are of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, not in themselves but only in relation to others: even as in <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> certain propositions are put forward on their own account, while others are put forward in order to manifest others. Now, since the chief object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> consists in those things which we hope to see, according to <a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse2">Hebrews 11:2</a>: "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of things to be hoped for," it follows that those things are in themselves of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which order us directly to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. Such are the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> of Persons in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> [The Leonine Edition reads: The Three Persons, the omnipotence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, etc.], the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, and the like: and these are distinct <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a>. On the other hand certain things in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> are proposed to our <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, not chiefly on their own account, but for the manifestation of those mentioned above: for instance, that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> had two sons, that a dead <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> rose again at the touch of <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a>' bones, and the like, which are related in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> for the purpose of manifesting the Divine <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> or the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> of Christ: and such things should not form distinct articles.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The formal aspect of the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> can be taken in two ways: first, on the part of the thing <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and thus there is one formal aspect of all matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, viz. the First Truth: and from this point of view there is no distinction of articles. Secondly, the formal aspect of matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, can be considered from our point of view; and thus the formal aspect of a matter of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is that it is something unseen; and from this point of view there are various distinct <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a>, as we saw above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This definition of an article is taken from an etymology of the word as derived from the <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a>, rather than in accordance with its real meaning, as derived from the Greek: hence it does not carry much weight. Yet even then it could be said that although <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is exacted of no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of coercion, since <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> act, yet it is exacted of him by a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of end, since "he that cometh to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He is," and "without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> it is impossible to please <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> declares (<a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse6">Hebrews 11:6</a>).

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the articles of faith have increased in course of time?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a> have not increased in course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Because, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse1">Hebrews 11:1</a>), "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of things to be hoped for." Now the same things are to be hoped for at all times. Therefore, at all times, the same things are to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, development has taken place, in <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> devised by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, on account of the lack of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in those who discovered them, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> observes (Metaph. ii). Now the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was not devised by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but was delivered to us by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated in <a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse8">Ephesians 2:8</a>: "It is the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Since then there can be no lack of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it seems that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was perfect from the beginning and did not increase as time went on.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the operation of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> proceeds in orderly fashion no less than the operation of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> always makes a beginning with perfect things, as <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> states (De Consol. iii). Therefore it seems that the operation of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> also began with perfect things, so that those who were the first to deliver the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it most perfectly.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, just as the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was delivered to us through the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, so too, in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was delivered by the early fathers to those who came later, according to <a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse7">Deuteronomy 32:7</a>: "Ask thy father, and he will declare to thee." Now the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were most fully instructed about the mysteries, for "they received them more fully than others, even as they received them earlier," as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says on <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse23">Romans 8:23</a>: "Ourselves also who have the first fruits of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>." Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has not increased as time went on.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xvi in Ezech.) that "the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers increased as time went on . . . and the nearer they were to Our Savior's coming, the more fully did they received the mysteries of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a> stand in the same relation to the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as self-evident principles to a teaching based on <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Among these principles there is a certain order, so that some are contained implicitly in others; thus all principles are reduced, as to their first principle, to this one: "The same thing cannot be affirmed and denied at the same time," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Metaph. iv, text. 9). On like manner all the articles are contained implicitly in certain primary matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, such as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> over the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, according to <a href="../bible/heb011.htm">Hebrews 11</a>: "He that cometh to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He is, and is a rewarder to them that seek Him." For the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> includes all that we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>, and in these our <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists; while <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> includes all those things which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> dispenses in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and which are the way to that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>: and in this way, again, some of those articles which follow from these are contained in others: thus <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">Redemption</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> includes <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> and so forth.

<p>Accordingly we must conclude that, as regards the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a>, they have not received any increase as time went on: since whatever those who lived later have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, was contained, albeit implicitly, in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of those Fathers who preceded them. But there was an increase in the number of articles <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> explicitly, since to those who lived in later times some were <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> explicitly which were not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> explicitly by those who lived before them. Hence the Lord said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> (<a href="../bible/exo006.htm#verse2">Exodus 6:2-3</a>): "I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'I am the Lord that appeared to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, to <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>'] . . . and My name Adonai I did not show them": David also said (<a href="../bible/psa118.htm#verse100">Psalm 118:100</a>): "I have had understanding above ancients": and the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse5">Ephesians 3:5</a>) that the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, "in other generations was not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, as it is now revealed to His holy <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Among men the same things were always to be hoped for from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But as they did not acquire this hope save through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the further they were removed from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in point of time, the further they were from obtaining what they hoped for. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse13">Hebrews 11:13</a>): "All these died according to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, not having received the promises, but beholding them afar off." Now the further off a thing is the less distinctly is it seen; wherefore those who were nigh to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> advent had a more distinct <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to be hoped for.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Progress in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> occurs in two ways. First, on the part of the teacher, be he one or many, who makes progress in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as time goes on: and this is the kind of progress that takes place in <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> devised by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Secondly, on the part of the learner; thus the master, who has perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the art, does not deliver it all at once to his disciple from the very outset, for he would not be able to take it all in, but he condescends to the disciple's capacity and instructs him little by little. It is in this way that men made progress in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as time went on. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse24">Galatians 3:24</a>) compares the state of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> to childhood.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Two <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> are requisite before actual generation can take place, an agent, namely, and <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. On the order of the active <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, the more perfect is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> first; and in this way <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> makes a beginning with perfect things, since the imperfect is not brought to perfection, except by something perfect already in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. On the other hand, in the order of the material <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, the imperfect comes first, and in this way <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> proceeds from the imperfect to the perfect. Now in the manifestation of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the active <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, having perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>; while <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is likened to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in receiving the influx of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> action. Hence, among men, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> had to proceed from imperfection to perfection; and, although some men have been after the manner of active <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, through being <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, nevertheless the manifestation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> is given to such men for the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse7">1 Corinthians 12:7</a>; so that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was imparted to the Fathers who were instructors in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so far as was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> at the time for the instruction of the people, either openly or in figures.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The ultimate consummation of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was effected by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, wherefore the time of His coming is called the "time of fulness [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'fulness of time']" (<a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse4">Galatians 4:4</a>). Hence those who were nearest to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, wherefore before, like <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a>, or after, like the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, had a fuller <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the mysteries of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; for even with regard to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> state we find that the perfection of manhood comes in youth, and that a man's state is all the more perfect, whether before or after, the nearer it is to the time of his youth.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether the articles of faith are suitably formulated?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a> are unsuitably formulated. For those things, which can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by demonstration, do not belong to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as to an object of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> for all, as stated above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>). Now it can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by demonstration that there is one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proves this (Metaph. xii, text. 52) and many other <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> demonstrated the same <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Therefore that "there is one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" should not be set down as an <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">article of faith</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that we should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be almighty, so is it too that we should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him to be "all-<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>" and "provident for all," about both of which points some have <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erred</a>. Therefore, among the <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a>, mention should have been made of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> wisdom and <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, even as of His omnipotence.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Father is the same things as to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Son, according to <a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse9">John 14:9</a>: "He that seeth Me, seeth the Father also." Therefore there ought to be but one article about the Father and Son, and, for the same reason, about the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the Person of the Father is no less than the Person of the Son, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Now there are several articles about the Person of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and likewise about the Person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. Therefore there should be several articles about the Person of the Father.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, just as certain things are said by appropriation, of the Person of the Father and of the Person of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, so too is something appropriated to the Person of the Son, in respect of His Godhead. Now, among the <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a>, a place is given to a work appropriated to the Father, viz. the creation, and likewise, a work appropriated to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, viz. that "He spoke by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a> should contain some work appropriated to the Son in respect of His Godhead.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> presents a special difficulty over and above the other articles. Therefore it should have been mentioned in a special article: and consequently it seems that there is not a sufficient number of articles.

<p><strong>On the contrary</strong> stands the authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> who formulates the articles thus.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (4,6), to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> those things in themselves belong, the sight of which we shall enjoy in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, and by which we are brought to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>. Now two things are proposed to us to be seen in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>: viz. the secret of the Godhead, to see which is to possess <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, "by Whom we have access" to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse2">Romans 5:2</a>. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse3">John 17:3</a>): "This is <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>: that they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Thee, the . . . <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> Whom Thou hast sent." Wherefore the first distinction in matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is that some concern the majesty of the Godhead, while others pertain to the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which is the "<a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">godliness</a>" (<a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse16">1 Timothy 3:16</a>).

<p>Now with regard to the majesty of the Godhead, three things are proposed to our <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>: first, the unity of the Godhead, to which the first article refers; secondly, the trinity of the Persons, to which three articles refer, corresponding to the three Persons; and thirdly, the works proper to the Godhead, the first of which refers to the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, in relation to which the article about the creation is proposed to us; the second refers to the order of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, in relation to which all matters concerning the sanctification of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> are included in one article; while the third refers to the order of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and in relation to this another article is proposed to us concerning the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the dead</a> and life everlasting. Thus there are seven articles referring to the Godhead.

<p>In like manner, with regard to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, there are seven articles, the first of which refers to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> incarnation or conception; the second, to His virginal birth; the third, to His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, death and burial; the fourth, to His descent into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>; the fifth, to <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">His resurrection</a>; the sixth, to His <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascension</a>; the seventh, to His coming for the judgment, so that in all there are fourteen articles.

<p>Some, however, distinguish twelve articles, six pertaining to the Godhead, and six to the humanity. For they include in one article the three about the three Persons; because we have one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the three Persons: while they divide the article referring to the work of glorification into two, viz. the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the body</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Likewise they unite the conception and nativity into one article.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> By <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> we hold many <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> were unable to discover by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, for instance His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> and omnipotence, and that He alone is to be worshiped, all of which are contained in the one article of the unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The very name of the Godhead implies a kind of watching over things, as stated in I, 13, 8. Now in beings having an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, power does not work save by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> omnipotence includes, in a way, universal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>. For He would not be able to do all He wills in things here below, unless He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> them, and exercised His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> over them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> We have but one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Father, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as to the unity of the Essence, to which the first article refers: but, as to the distinction of the Persons, which is by the relations of origin, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Father does indeed, in a way, include <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Son, for He would not be Father, had He not a Son; the bond whereof being the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. From this point of view, there was a sufficient motive for those who referred one article to the three Persons. Since, however, with regard to each Person, certain points have to be observed, about which some happen to fall into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, looking at it in this way, we may distinguish three articles about the three Persons. For <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the omnipotence and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of the Father, but did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the Son to be co-equal and consubstantial with the Father; hence the need for an article about the Person of the Son in order to settle this point. On like manner it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to appoint a third article about the Person of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, against Macedonius. On the same way <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> conception and birth, just as the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> and life everlasting, can from one point of view be united together in one article, in so far as they are ordained to one end; while, from another point of view, they can be distinct articles, in as much as each one separately presents a special difficulty.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> It belongs to the Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> to be sent to sanctify the creature; and about this several things have to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. Hence it is that there are more articles about the Persons of the Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> than about the Person of the Father, Who is never sent, as we stated in I, 43, 4.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The sanctification of a creature by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and its consummation by <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, is also effected by the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which is appropriated to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and by the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of wisdom, which is appropriated to the Son: so that each work belongs by appropriation, but under different aspects, both to the Son and to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> Two things may be considered in the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>. One is the fact that it is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, and in this respect it is like the other effects of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>. The other is that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> contained therein and thus it is included under <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> omnipotence, like all other <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which are ascribed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> almighty power.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether it is suitable for the articles of faith to be embodied in a symbol?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is unsuitable for the <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a> to be embodied in a symbol. Because <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> is the rule of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, to which no addition or subtraction can lawfully be made, since it is written (<a href="../bible/deu004.htm#verse2">Deuteronomy 4:2</a>): "You shall not add to the word that I speak to you, neither shall you take away from it." Therefore it was unlawful to make a symbol as a rule of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, after the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> had once been published.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse5">Ephesians 4:5</a>) there is but "one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>." Now the symbol is a profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Therefore it is not fitting that there should be more than one symbol.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which is contained in the symbol, concerns all the faithful. Now the faithful are not all competent to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but only those who have living <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Therefore it is unfitting for the symbol of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to be expressed in the words: "I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the descent into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> is one of the <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a>, as stated above (<a href="#8">Article 8</a>). But the descent into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> is not mentioned in the symbol of the Fathers. Therefore the latter is expressed inadequately.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Tract. xxix in Joan.) expounding the passage, "You <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> also in Me" (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse1">John 14:1</a>) says: "We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> or <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, but we speak only of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> 'in' <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Since then the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Church is merely a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> being, it seems unfitting to say: "In the One, Holy, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Apostolic Church."

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, a symbol is drawn up that it may be a rule of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Now a rule of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> ought to be proposed to all, and that publicly. Therefore every symbol, besides the symbol of the Fathers, should be sung at Mass. Therefore it seems unfitting to publish the <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a> in a symbol.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">universal</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, since she is governed by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, Who is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: for such was <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> promise to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> (<a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse13">John 16:13</a>): "When He, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, is come, He will teach you all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." Now the symbol is published by the authority of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">universal</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Therefore it contains nothing defective.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse6">Hebrews 11:6</a>), "he that cometh to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He is." Now a man cannot <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, unless the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> be proposed to him that he may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it. Hence the need for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to be collected together, so that it might the more easily be proposed to all, lest anyone might stray from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. It is from its being a collection of maxims of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that the symbol [The Greek <em>symballein</em>] takes its name.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is contained in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>, diffusely, under various modes of expression, and sometimes obscurely, so that, in order to gather the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> from <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>, one needs long study and practice, which are unattainable by all those who require to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, many of whom have no time for study, being busy with other affairs. And so it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to gather together a clear summary from the sayings of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>, to be proposed to the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> of all. This indeed was no addition to <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>, but something taken from it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The same doctrine of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is taught in all the symbols. Nevertheless, the people need more careful instruction about the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, when <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> arise, lest the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of simple-minded <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> be corrupted by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. It was this that gave rise to the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of formulating several symbols, which nowise differ from one another, save that on account of the obstinacy of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, one contains more explicitly what another contains implicitly.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is drawn up in a symbol in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, as it were, of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which is united together by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is living <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; since such is the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to be found in all those who are of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> not only outwardly but also by <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. Hence the confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is expressed in a symbol, in a manner that is in keeping with living <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so that even if some of the faithful lack living <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, they should endeavor to acquire it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> No <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> about the descent into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> had arisen among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, so that there was no need to be more explicit on that point. For this reason it is not repeated in the <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">symbol of the Fathers</a>, but is supposed as already settled in the <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">symbol of the Apostles</a>. For a subsequent symbol does not cancel a preceding one; rather does it expound it, as stated above (ad 2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> If we say: "'In' the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Church," this must be taken as verified in so far as our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is directed to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, Who sanctifies the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; so that the sense is: "I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> sanctifying the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>." But it is better and more in keeping with the common use, to omit the 'in,' and say simply, "the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Church," as Pope Leo [Rufinus, Comm. in Sym. Apost.] observes.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> Since the symbol of the Fathers is an explanation of the <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">symbol of the Apostles</a>, and was drawn up after the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was already spread abroad, and when the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was already at peace, it is sung publicly in the Mass. On the other hand the <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">symbol of the Apostles</a>, which was drawn up at the time of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, before the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was made public, is said secretly at Prime and Compline, as though it were against the darkness of past and future <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>.

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether it belongs to the Sovereign Pontiff to draw up a symbol of faith?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it does not belong to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Sovereign Pontiff</a> to draw up a symbol of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For a new edition of the symbol becomes <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in order to explain the <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a>, as stated above (<a href="#9">Article 9</a>). Now, in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a> were more and more explained as time went on, by reason of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> becoming clearer through greater nearness to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as stated above (<a href="#7">Article 7</a>). Since then this reason ceased with the advent of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, there is no need for the <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a> to be more and more explicit. Therefore it does not seem to belong to the authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Sovereign Pontiff</a> to draw up a new edition of the symbol.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has the power to do what is forbidden under pain of <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">universal</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Now it was forbidden under pain of <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">universal</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to make a new edition of the <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">symbol</a>. For it is stated in the acts of the <a href="../cathen/05491a.htm">first council of Ephesus</a> (P. ii, Act. 6) that "after the <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">symbol of the Nicene council</a> had been read through, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod decreed that it was unlawful to utter, write or draw up any other creed, than that which was defined by the Fathers assembled at Nicaea together with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>," and this under pain of <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>. <span class="stiki"><a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> wrote 'first' (expunged by Nicolai) to distinguish it from the other council, A.D. 451, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as the <a href="../cathen/05495a.htm">"Latrocinium"</a> and condemned by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>.</span> The same was repeated in the acts of the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">council of Chalcedon</a> (P. ii, Act. 5). Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Sovereign Pontiff</a> has no authority to publish a new edition of the <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">symbol</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> was not the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Sovereign Pontiff</a>, but patriarch of Alexandria, and yet he published a <a href="../cathen/02033b.htm">symbol</a> which is sung in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Therefore it does not seem to belong to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Sovereign Pontiff</a> any more than to other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, to publish a new edition of the symbol.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The symbol was drawn us by a general council. Now such a council cannot be convoked otherwise than by the authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Sovereign Pontiff</a>, as stated in the Decretals [Dist. xvii, Can. 4,5. Therefore it belongs to the authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Sovereign Pontiff</a> to draw up a symbol.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Objection 1), a new edition of the symbol becomes <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in order to set aside the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> that may arise. Consequently to publish a new edition of the symbol belongs to that authority which is empowered to decide matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> finally, so that they may be held by all with unshaken <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Now this belongs to the authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Sovereign Pontiff</a>, "to whom the more important and more difficult questions that arise in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are referred," as stated in the Decretals [Dist. xvii, Can. 5. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> whom he made <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Sovereign Pontiff</a> (<a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse32">Luke 22:32</a>): "I have <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for thee," <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, "that thy <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> fail not, and thou, being once <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>, confirm thy brethren." The reason of this is that there should be but one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse10">1 Corinthians 1:10</a>: "That you all speak the same thing, and that there be no schisms among you": and this could not be secured unless any question of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that may arise be decided by him who presides over the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, so that the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> may hold firmly to his decision. Consequently it belongs to the sole authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Sovereign Pontiff</a> to publish a new edition of the symbol, as do all other matters which concern the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, such as to convoke a general council and so forth.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is sufficiently explicit in the teaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. But since, according to <a href="../bible/2pe003.htm#verse16">2 Peter 3:16</a>, some men are so evil-minded as to pervert the apostolic teaching and other doctrines and <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> to their own destruction, it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> as time went on to express the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> more explicitly against the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> which arose.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This prohibition and sentence of the council was intended for private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, who have no business to decide matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: for this decision of the general council did not take away from a subsequent council the power of drawing up a new edition of the symbol, containing not indeed a new <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with greater explicitness. For every council has taken into account that a subsequent council would expound matters more fully than the preceding council, if this became <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> through some <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> arising. Consequently this belongs to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Sovereign Pontiff</a>, by whose authority the council is convoked, and its decision confirmed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> drew up a declaration of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, not under the form of a symbol, but rather by way of an exposition of doctrine, as appears from his way of speaking. But since it contained briefly the whole <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, it was accepted by the authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Sovereign Pontiff</a>, so as to be considered as a rule of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.
