<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether it belongs to man to act for an end?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it does not belong to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to act for an end. For a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> first. But an end, in its very name, implies something that is last. Therefore an end is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But that for which a man acts, is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of his action; since this preposition "for" indicates a relation of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>. Therefore it does not belong to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to act for an end.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which is itself the last end is not for an end. But in some cases the last end is an action, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. i, 1). Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not do everything for an end.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, then does a man seem to act for an end, when he acts deliberately. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does many things without deliberation, sometimes not even thinking of what he is doing; for instance when one moves one's foot or hand, or scratches one's beard, while intent on something else. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not do everything for an end.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> All things contained in a genus are derived from the principle of that genus. Now the end is the principle in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> operations, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Phys. ii, 9). Therefore it belongs to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to do everything for an end.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Of actions done by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> those alone are properly called "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>," which are proper to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> differs from irrational animals in this, that he is master of his actions. Wherefore those actions alone are properly called <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, of which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is master. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is master of his actions through his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> and will; whence, too, the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is defined as "the faculty and will of reason." Therefore those actions are properly called <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> which proceed from a deliberate will. And if any other actions are found in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, they can be called actions "of a man," but not properly "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>" actions, since they are not proper to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Now it is clear that whatever actions proceed from a power, are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by that power in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of its object. But the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the end and the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions must be for an end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although the end be last in the order of execution, yet it is first in the order of the agent's <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>. And it is this way that it is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> action be the last end, it must be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, else it would not be <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, as stated above. Now an action is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> in one of two ways: first, because it is commanded by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, e.g. to walk, or to speak; secondly, because it is elicited by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, for instance the very act of willing. Now it is impossible for the very act elicited by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to be the last end. For the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the end, just as the object of sight is color: wherefore just as the first visible cannot be the act of seeing, because every act of seeing is directed to a visible object; so the first appetible, i.e. the end, cannot be the very act of willing. Consequently it follows that if a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> action be the last end, it must be an action commanded by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: so that there, some action of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, at least the act of willing, is for the end. Therefore whatever a man does, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to say that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> acts for an end, even when he does that action in which the last end consists.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Such like actions are not properly <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions; since they do not proceed from deliberation of the reason, which is the proper principle of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions. Therefore they have indeed an <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> end, but not one that is fixed by reason.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether it is proper to the rational nature to act for an end?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is proper to the rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to act for an end. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, to whom it belongs to act for an end, never acts for an unknown end. On the other hand, there are many things that have no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of an end; either because they are altogether without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, as insensible creatures: or because they do not apprehend the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of an end as such, as irrational animals. Therefore it seems proper to the rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to act for an end.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to act for an end is to order one's action to an end. But this is the work of reason. Therefore it does not belong to things that lack reason.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and the end is the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. But "the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is in the reason" (De Anima iii, 9). Therefore to act for an end belongs to none but a rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proves (Phys. ii, 5) that "not only mind but also <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> acts for an end."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Every agent, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, acts for an end. For if, in a number of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> ordained to one another, the first be removed, the others must, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, be removed also. Now the first of all <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> is the final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. The reason of which is that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> does not receive form, save in so far as it is moved by an agent; for nothing reduces itself from <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to act. But an agent does not move except out of <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> for an end. For if the agent were not determinate to some particular effect, it would not do one thing rather than another: consequently in order that it produce a determinate effect, it must, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, be determined to some certain one, which has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an end. And just as this determination is effected, in the rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, by the "rational <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>," which is called the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; so, in other things, it is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination, which is called the "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>."

<p>Nevertheless it must be observed that a thing tends to an end, by its action or movement, in two ways: first, as a thing, moving itself to the end, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; secondly, as a thing moved by another to the end, as an arrow tends to a determinate end through being moved by the archer who directs his action to the end. Therefore those things that are possessed of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, move themselves to an end; because they have dominion over their actions through their <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, which is the "faculty of will and reason." But those things that lack reason tend to an end, by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination, as being moved by another and not by themselves; since they do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an end as such, and consequently cannot ordain anything to an end, but can be ordained to an end only by another. For the entire irrational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is in comparison to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as an instrument to the principal agent, as stated above (I, 22, 2, ad 4; I, 103, 1, ad 3). Consequently it is proper to the rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to tend to an end, as directing [agens] and leading itself to the end: whereas it is proper to the irrational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to tend to an end, as directed or led by another, whether it apprehend the end, as do irrational animals, or do not apprehend it, as is the case of those things which are altogether void of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> When a man of himself acts for an end, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the end: but when he is directed or led by another, for instance, when he acts at another's command, or when he is moved under another's compulsion, it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that he should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the end. And it is thus with irrational creatures.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> To ordain towards an end belongs to that which directs itself to an end: whereas to be ordained to an end belongs to that which is directed by another to an end. And this can belong to an irrational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but owing to some one possessed of reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the end and the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in universal. Consequently there can be no will in those things that lack reason and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, since they cannot apprehend the universal; but they have a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> or a sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, determinate to some particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now it is clear that particular <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> are moved by a universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: thus the governor of a city, who intends the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, moves, by his command, all the particular departments of the city. Consequently all things that lack reason are, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, moved to their particular ends by some rational will which extends to the universal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, namely by the Divine will.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether human acts are specified by their end?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> are not specified by their end. For the end is an extrinsic <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But everything is specified by an intrinsic principle. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> are not specified by their end.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which gives a thing its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> should <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> before it. But the end comes into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> afterwards. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a> does not derive its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the end.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, one thing cannot be in more than one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But one and the same act may happen to be ordained to various ends. Therefore the end does not give the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> to <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Mor. Eccl. et Manich. ii, 13): "According as their end is worthy of blame or praise so are our <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> worthy of blame or praise."

<p><strong>I answer that</strong> Each thing receives its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in respect of an act and not in respect of <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>; wherefore things composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> are established in their respective <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> by their own forms. And this is also to be observed in proper movements. For since movements are, in a way, divided into action and passion, each of these receives its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from an act; action indeed from the act which is the principle of acting, and passion from the act which is the terminus of the movement. Wherefore heating, as an action, is nothing else than a certain movement proceeding from heat, while heating as a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> is nothing else than a movement towards heat: and it is the definition that shows the specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. And either way, <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, whether they be considered as actions, or as <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, receive their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the end. For <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> can be considered in both ways, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> moves himself, and is moved by himself. Now it has been stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>) that acts are called <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, inasmuch as they proceed from a deliberate will. Now the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and the end. And hence it is clear that the principle of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, in so far as they are <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, is the end. In like manner it is their terminus: for the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a> terminates at that which the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> intends as the end; thus in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> agents the form of the thing generated is conformed to the form of the generator. And since, as <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (Prolog. super Luc.) "<a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morality</a> is said properly of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," moral acts properly speaking receive their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the end, for moral acts are the same as <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The end is not altogether extrinsic to the act, because it is related to the act as principle or terminus; and thus it just this that is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to an act, viz. to proceed from something, considered as action, and to proceed towards something, considered as passion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The end, in so far as it pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, pertains to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as stated above (01, ad 1). And it is thus that it gives the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> or moral act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> One and the same act, in so far as it proceeds once from the agent, is ordained to but one proximate end, from which it has its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>: but it can be ordained to several remote ends, of which one is the end of the other. It is possible, however, that an act which is one in respect of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, be ordained to several ends of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: thus this act "to kill a man," which is but one act in respect of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, can be ordained, as to an end, to the safeguarding of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and to the satisfying of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>: the result being that there would be several acts in different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morality</a>: since in one way there will be an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, in another, an act of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. For a movement does not receive its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from that which is its terminus <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, but only from that which is its "per se" terminus. Now moral ends are <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> thing, and conversely the relation to a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> end is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morality</a>. Consequently there is no reason why acts which are the same considered in their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, should not be diverse, considered in their moral <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and conversely.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether there is one last end of human life?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is no last end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, but that we proceed to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> diffusive, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> states (Div. Nom. iv). Consequently if that which proceeds from <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is itself <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, the latter must needs diffuse some other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: so that the diffusion of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> goes on indefinitely. But <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an end. Therefore there is an indefinite series of ends.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, things pertaining to the reason can be multiplied to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>: thus mathematical quantities have no limit. For the same reason the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of numbers are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, since, given any number, the reason can think of one yet greater. But desire of the end is consequent on the apprehension of the reason. Therefore it seems that there is also an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> series of ends.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and the end is the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> can react on itself an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of times: for I can will something, and will to will it, and so on indefinitely. Therefore there is an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> series of ends of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will, and there is no last end of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. ii, 2) that "to suppose a thing to be indefinite is to deny that it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is that which has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an end. Therefore it is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an end to proceed indefinitely. Therefore it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to fix one last end.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Absolutely speaking, it is not possible to proceed indefinitely in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of ends, from any point of view. For in whatsoever things there is an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> order of one to another, if the first be removed, those that are ordained to the first, must of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> be removed also. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proves (Phys. viii, 5) that we cannot proceed to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitude</a> in <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of movement, because then there would be no first mover, without which neither can the others move, since they move only through being moved by the first mover. Now there is to be observed a twofold order in ends--the order of <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> and the order of execution: and in either of these orders there must be something first. For that which is first in the order of <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, is the principle, as it were, moving the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; consequently, if you remove this principle, there will be nothing to move the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. On the other hand, the principle in execution is that wherein operation has its beginning; and if this principle be taken away, no one will begin to work. Now the principle in the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is the last end; while the principle in execution is the first of the things which are ordained to the end. Consequently, on neither side is it possible to go to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> since if there were no last end, nothing would be desired, nor would any action have its term, nor would the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the agent be at rest; while if there is no first thing among those that are ordained to the end, none would begin to work at anything, and counsel would have no term, but would continue indefinitely.

<p>On the other hand, nothing hinders <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> from being in things that are ordained to one another not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> but <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>; for <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> are indeterminate. And in this way it happens that there is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> of ends, and of things ordained to the end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is that something flows from it, but not that it flows from something else. Since, therefore, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of end, and the first <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is the last end, this argument does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that there is no last end; but that from the end, already supposed, we may proceed downwards indefinitely towards those things that are ordained to the end. And this would be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> if we considered but the power of the First Good, which is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. But, since the First Good diffuses itself according to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, to which it is proper to flow forth into its effects according to a certain fixed form; it follows that there is a certain measure to the flow of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things from the First Good from Which all other goods share the power of diffusion. Consequently the diffusion of goods does not proceed indefinitely but, as it is written (<a href="../bible/wis011.htm#verse21">Wisdom 11:21</a>), <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> disposes all things "in number, weight and measure."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In things which are of themselves, reason begins from principles that are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, and advances to some term. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proves (Poster. i, 3) that there is no <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> process in demonstrations, because there we find a process of things having an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a>, not an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>, connection with one another. But in those things which are <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> connected, nothing hinders the reason from proceeding indefinitely. Now it is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to a stated <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> or number, as such, that <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> or unity be added to it. Wherefore in such like things nothing hinders the reason from an indefinite process.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This multiplication of acts of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> reacting on itself, is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to the order of ends. This is clear from the fact that in regard to one and the same end, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> reacts on itself indifferently once or several times.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether one man can have several last ends?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem possible for one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will to be directed at the same time to several things, as last ends. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xix, 1) that some held <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> last end to consist in four things, viz. "in pleasure, repose, the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>." But these are clearly more than one thing. Therefore one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can place the last end of his will in many things.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, things not in opposition to one another do not exclude one another. Now there are many things which are not in opposition to one another. Therefore the supposition that one thing is the last end of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does not exclude others.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, by the fact that it places its last end in one thing, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does not lose its freedom. But before it placed its last end in that thing, e.g. pleasure, it could place it in something else, e.g. <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>. Therefore even after having placed his last end in pleasure, a man can at the same time place his last end in <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>. Therefore it is possible for one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will to be directed at the same time to several things, as last ends.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> That in which a man rests as in his last end, is master of his affections, since he takes therefrom his entire rule of life. Hence of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttons</a> it is written (<a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse19">Philippians 3:19</a>): "Whose god is their belly": viz. because they place their last end in the pleasures of the belly. Now according to <a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse24">Matthew 6:24</a>, "No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can serve two masters," such, namely, as are not ordained to one another. Therefore it is impossible for one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to have several last ends not ordained to one another.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is impossible for one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will to be directed at the same time to diverse things, as last ends. Three reasons may be assigned for this. First, because, since everything desires its own perfection, a man desires for his ultimate end, that which he desires as his perfect and crowning <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei xix, 1): "In speaking of the end of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> we mean now, not that it passes away so as to be no more, but that it is perfected so as to be complete." It is therefore <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the last end so to fill <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, that nothing is left besides it for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to desire. Which is not possible, if something else be required for his perfection. Consequently it is not possible for the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> so to tend to two things, as though each were its perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p>The second reason is because, just as in the process of reasoning, the principle is that which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, so in the process of the rational <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, the principle needs to be that which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> desired. Now this must needs be one: since <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> tends to one thing only. But the principle in the process of the rational <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is the last end. Therefore that to which the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> tends, as to its last end, is one.

<p>The third reason is because, since <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> actions receive their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the end, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), they must needs receive their genus from the last end, which is common to them all: just as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things are placed in a genus according to a common form. Since, then, all things that can be desired by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, belong, as such, to one genus, the last end must needs be one. And all the more because in every genus there is one first principle; and the last end has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a first principle, as stated above. Now as the last end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, simply as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, is to the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, so is the last end of any <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to that <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. Therefore, just as of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> there is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> one last end, so the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> must be fixed on one last end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> All these several objects were considered as one perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> resulting therefrom, by those who placed in them the last end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although it is possible to find several things which are not in opposition to one another, yet it is contrary to a thing's perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, that anything besides be required for that thing's perfection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The power of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does not extend to making opposites <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> at the same time. Which would be the case were it to tend to several diverse objects as last ends, as has been shown above (ad 2).

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether man will all, whatsoever he wills, for the last end?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not will all, whatsoever he wills, for the last end. For things ordained to the last end are said to be serious <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as being useful. But jests are foreign to serious <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Therefore what <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does in jest, he ordains not to the last end.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says at the beginning of his Metaphysics [1, 2] that speculative science is sought for its own sake. Now it cannot be said that each speculative science is the last end. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not desire all, whatsoever he desires, for the last end.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whosoever ordains something to an end, thinks of that end. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not always think of the last end in all that he desires or does. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> neither desires nor does all for the last end.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xix, 1): "That is the end of our <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, for the sake of which we love other things, whereas we love it for its own sake."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Man must, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, desire all, whatsoever he desires, for the last end. This is evident for two reasons. First, because whatever <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> desires, he desires it under the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. And if he desire it, not as his perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is the last end, he must, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, desire it as tending to the perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, because the beginning of anything is always ordained to its completion; as is clearly the case in effects both of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and of art. Wherefore every beginning of perfection is ordained to complete perfection which is achieved through the last end. Secondly, because the last end stands in the same relation in moving the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, as the first mover in other movements. Now it is clear that secondary moving <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> do not move save inasmuch as they are moved by the first mover. Therefore secondary objects of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> do not move the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, except as ordained to the first object of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, which is the last end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Actions done jestingly are not directed to any external end; but merely to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the jester, in so far as they afford him pleasure or relaxation. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> consummate <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is his last end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The same applies to speculative science; which is desired as the scientist's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, included in complete and perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is the ultimate end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> One need not always be thinking of the last end, whenever one desires or does something: but the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the first <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, which was in respect of the last end, remains in every desire directed to any object whatever, even though one's thoughts be not actually directed to the last end. Thus while walking along the road one needs not to be thinking of the end at every step.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether all men have the same last end?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> have not the same last end. For before all else the unchangeable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> seems to be the last end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But some turn away from the unchangeable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>. Therefore all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> have not the same last end.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> entire life is ruled according to his last end. If, therefore, all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> had the same last end, they would not have various pursuits in life. Which is evidently <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the end is the term of action. But actions are of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>. Now although men agree in their specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, yet they differ in things pertaining to <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>. Therefore all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> have not the same last end.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiii, 3) that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> agree in desiring the last end, which is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We can speak of the last end in two ways: first, considering only the aspect of last end; secondly, considering the thing in which the aspect of last end is realized. So, then, as to the aspect of last end, all agree in desiring the last end: since all desire the fulfilment of their perfection, and it is precisely this fulfilment in which the last end consists, as stated above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>). But as to the thing in which this aspect is realized, all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are not agreed as to their last end: since some desire <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> as their consummate <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; some, pleasure; others, something else. Thus to every taste the sweet is pleasant but to some, the sweetness of wine is most pleasant, to others, the sweetness of honey, or of something similar. Yet that sweet is absolutely the best of all pleasant things, in which he who has the best taste takes most pleasure. In like manner that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is most complete which the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with well disposed affections desires for his last end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Those who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> turn from that in which their last end really consists: but they do not turn away from the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the last end, which <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> they mistakenly seek in other things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Various pursuits in life are found among men by reason of the various things in which men seek to find their last end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although actions are of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, yet their first principle of action is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which tends to one thing, as stated above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>).

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether other creatures concur in that last end?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that all other creatures concur in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> last end. For the end corresponds to the beginning. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> beginning--i.e. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>--is also the beginning of all else. Therefore all other things concur in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> last end.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> turns all things to Himself as to their last end." But He is also <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> last end; because He alone is to be enjoyed by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 5,22). Therefore other things, too, concur in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> last end.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> last end is the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. But the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the universal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is the end of all. Therefore other things, too, concur in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> last end.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> last end is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>; which all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> desire, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiii, 3,4). But "<a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is not possible for animals bereft of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. 83, qu. 5). Therefore other things do not concur in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> last end.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Phys. ii, 2), the end is twofold--the end "for which" and the end "by which"; viz. the thing itself in which is found the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and the use or acquisition of that thing. Thus we say that the end of the movement of a weighty body is either a lower place as "thing," or to be in a lower place, as "use"; and the end of the miser is money as "thing," or possession of money as "use."

<p>If, therefore, we speak of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> last end as of the thing which is the end, thus all other things concur in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> last end, since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the last end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and of all other things. If, however, we speak of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> last end, as of the acquisition of the end, then irrational creatures do not concur with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in this end. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and other rational creatures attain to their last end by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: this is not possible to other creatures, which acquire their last end, in so far as they share in the Divine likeness, inasmuch as they are, or live, or even <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>.

<p>Hence it is evident how the objections are solved: since <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> means the acquisition of the last end.
