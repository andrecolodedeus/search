<h1>Question 1. The Quality of Those Souls Who Depart This Life With Original Sin Only</h1>

<ol> <li><a href="../summa/6001.htm#article1"> Do these souls suffer from a bodily fire, and are they inflicted with punishment by fire?</a> <li><a href="../summa/6001.htm#article2"> Do these souls suffer from a spiritual torment within themselves?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether those souls which depart with original sin alone, suffer from a bodily fire, and are punished by fire?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> which depart with none but <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, suffer from a bodily fire and are punished by fire. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [Fulgentius, De Fide ad Petrum, xxvii] says: "Hold firmly and <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> not that children who depart this life without the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> will be punished everlastingly." Now punishment denotes sensible pain. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> which depart this life with <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> alone, suffer from a bodily fire and are tormented with the pain of fire.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a greater fault deserves a greater punishment. Now <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is greater than venial, because it contains more aversion, since it deprives its subject of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, whereas venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is compatible with <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; and again because <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is punished <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>, whereas venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is punished temporally. Seeing then that venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is deserving of the punishment of fire, much more so is <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are more severely punished after this life than during lifetime, for in this life there is room for mercy. Now, sensible punishment corresponds to <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> in this life, for children who have only <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> are <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> subject to many sensible punishments. Therefore sensible punishment is due to it after this life.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, even as in actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> there is aversion and conversion, so in <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> there is something corresponding to aversion, namely the privation of original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and something corresponding to conversion, namely <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. Now the punishment of fire is due to actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by reason of the conversion. Therefore it is also due to <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> by reason of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> the bodies of children will be either passible or impassible. If they be impassible--and no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body can be impassible except either on account of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of impassibility (as in the blessed) or by reason of original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> (as in the state of innocence)--it follows that the bodies of children will either have the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of impassibility, and thus will be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, so that there will be no difference between <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and non-baptizedchildren, which is <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>, or else they will have original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and thus will be without <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, and will not be punished for <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, which is likewise <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>. If, on the other hand, they be passible, since everything passible suffers of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> in the presence of the active, it follows that in the presence of active sensible bodies they will suffer sensible punishment.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion xxiii) that the mildest punishment of all will be for those who are burdened with <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> only. But this would not be so, if they were tormented with sensible punishment, because the pain of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> fire is most grievous. Therefore they will not suffer sensible punishment.

<p>Further, the grief of sensible punishment corresponds to the pleasure of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (<a href="../bible/rev018.htm#verse7">Apocalypse 18:7</a>): "As much as she hath glorified herself and lived in delicacies, so much torment and sorrow give ye to her." But there is no pleasure in <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, as neither is there operation, for pleasure follows operation, as stated in Ethic. x, 4. Therefore punishment by fire is not due to <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory Nazianzen</a> in his fortieth sermon, which is entitled <em>On Holy Baptism</em>, distinguishes three classes of unbaptized <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>: those namely who refuse to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, those who through neglect have put off being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> until the end of life and have been surprised by sudden death, and those who, like infants, have failed to receive it through no fault of theirs. Of the first he says that they will be punished not only for their other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but also for their contempt of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>; of the second, that they will be punished, though less severely than the first, for having neglected it; and of the last he says that "a just and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Judge will consign them neither to heavenly <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> nor to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> pains of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, for although they have not been signed with <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, they are without <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, and have suffered rather than <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> their loss of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>." He also gives the reason why, although they do not reach the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, they do not therefore suffer the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a> suffered by the damned: "Because there is a mean between the two, since he who deserves not <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is not for that reason worthy of punishment, and on the other hand he who is not deserving of punishment is not for that reason worthy of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Punishment should be proportionate to fault, according to the saying of <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaias</a> (<a href="../bible/isa027.htm#verse8">27:8</a>), "In measure against measure, when it shall be cast off, thou shalt judge it." Now the defect transmitted to us through our origin, and having the character of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not result from the withdrawal or corruption of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> consequent upon <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> by virtue of its principles, but from the withdrawal or corruption of something that had been superadded to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Nor does this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> belong to this particular <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, except in so far as he has such a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, that is deprived of this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which in the ordinary course of things he would have had and would have been able to keep. Wherefore no further punishment is due to him, besides the privation of that end to which the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> withdrawn destined him, which <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is unable of itself to obtain. Now this is the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">divine vision</a>; and consequently the loss of this <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision</a> is the proper and only punishment of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> after death: because, if any other sensible punishment were inflicted after death for <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, a man would be punished out of proportion to his guilt, for sensible punishment is inflicted for that which is proper to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, since a man undergoes sensible punishment in so far as he suffers in his <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Hence, as his guilt did not result from an action of his own, even so neither should he be punished by suffering himself, but only by losing that which his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was unable to obtain. On the other hand, those who are under sentence for <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> will suffer no loss whatever in other kinds of perfection and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> which are consequent upon <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> by virtue of its principles.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In the authority quoted punishment denotes, not pain of sense, but only pain of loss, which is the privation of the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">divine vision</a>, even as in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> the word "fire" is often wont to signify any kind of punishment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is the least, because it is the least <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>; for it is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> not by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, but only by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the origin of our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, even venial, is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in which it is; wherefore a lighter punishment is due to original than to venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Nor does it matter that <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is incompatible with <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; because privation of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> has the character, not of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but of punishment, except in so far as it is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>: for which reason that which is less <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> is less <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. Again it matters not that actual venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is deserving of temporal punishment, since this is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>, for as much as he who falls venially has sufficient <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to attenuate the punishment. For if venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> were in a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, it would be punished <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There is no parity between pain of sense before and after death, since before death the pain of sense results from the power of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> agent, whether the pain of sense be interior as fever or the like, or exterior as burning and so forth. Whereas after death nothing will act by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power, but only according to the order of divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, whether the object of such action be the separate <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, on which it is clear that fire cannot act <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, or the body after <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, since then all <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> action will cease, through the cessation of the first movable which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all bodily movement and alteration.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Sensible pain corresponds to sensible pleasure, which is in the conversion of actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: whereas <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, which is in <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, has no pleasure. Hence, sensible pain does not correspond thereto as punishment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The bodies of children will be impassible, not through their being unable in themselves to suffer, but through the lack of an external agent to act upon them: because, after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, no body will act on another, least of all so as to induce corruption by the action of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but there will only be action to the effect of punishing them by order of the divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Wherefore those bodies to which pain of sense is not due by divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> will not suffer punishment. On the other hand, the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will be impassible, because they will lack the capability of suffering; hence impassibility in them will be a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, but not in children.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether these same souls suffer spiritual affliction on account of the state in which they are?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in question suffer <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> affliction on account of the state wherein they are, because as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. xxiii in Matth.), the punishment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in that they will be deprived of <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">seeing God</a> will be more painful than their being burned in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell fire</a>. Now these <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> will be deprived of <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">seeing God</a>. Therefore they will suffer <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> affliction thereby.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, one cannot, without suffering, lack what one wishes to have. But these <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> would wish to have the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">divine vision</a>, else their will would be actually perverse. Therefore since they are deprived of it, seemingly they also suffer.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if it be said that they do not suffer, because they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that through no fault of theirs they are deprived thereof, on the contrary: Freedom from fault does not lessen but increases the pain of punishment: for a man does not grieve less for that he is disinherited or deprived of a limb through no fault of his. Therefore these <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> likewise, albeit deprived of so great a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> through no fault of theirs, suffer none the less.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> children are in relation to the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, so are unbaptized children to the demerit of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>. But <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> children receive the reward of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> by virtue of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. Therefore the unbaptized suffer pain through being deprived of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> on account of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam's</a> demerit.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, separation from what we love cannot be without pain. But these children will have <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and for that very reason will <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>. Therefore since they are separated from Him for ever, seemingly they cannot undergo this separation without pain.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> If unbaptized children have interior sorrow after death, they will grieve either for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> or for their punishment. If for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, since they cannot be further cleansed from that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, their sorrow will lead them to <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>. Now sorrow of this kind in the damned is the worm of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. Therefore these children will have the worm of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and consequently theirs would not be the mildest punishment, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says it is [See 1, "On the contrary"]. If, on the other hand, they grieve for their punishment, it follows, since their punishment is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> inflicted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that their will opposes itself to divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and thus would be actually inordinate, which is not to be granted. Therefore they will feel no sorrow.

<p>Further, right reason does not allow one to be disturbed on account of what one was unable to avoid; hence Seneca proves (Ep. lxxxv, and De ira ii, 6) that "a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not disturbed." Now in these children there is right reason deflected by no actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore they will not be disturbed for that they undergo this punishment which they could nowise avoid.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> on this question there are three opinions. Some say that these children will suffer no pain, because their reason will be so much in the dark that they will not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they lack what they have lost. It, however, seems improbable that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> freed from its bodily burden should ignore things which, to say the least, reason is able to explore, and many more besides. Hence others say that they have perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things subject to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that they are deprived of seeing Him, and that they feel some kind of sorrow on this account but that their sorrow will be mitigated, in so far as it was not by their will that they incurred the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for which they are condemned. Yet this again would seem improbable, because this sorrow cannot be little for the loss of so great a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, especially without the hope of recovery: wherefore their punishment would not be the mildest. Moreover the very same reason that impugns their being punished with pain of sense, as afflicting them from without, argues against their feeling sorrow within, because the pain of punishment corresponds to the pleasure of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; wherefore, since <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is void of pleasure, its punishment is free of all pain. Consequently others say that they will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> perfectly things subject to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and both the fact of their being deprived of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> and the reason for this privation, and that nevertheless this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> will not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> any sorrow in them. How this may be possible we must explore.

<p>Accordingly, it must be observed that if one is guided by right reason one does not grieve through being deprived of what is beyond one's power to obtain, but only through lack of that which, in some way, one is capable of obtaining. Thus no wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> grieves for being unable to fly like a bird, or for that he is not a king or an emperor, since these things are not due to him; whereas he would grieve if he lacked that to which he had some kind of claim. I say, then, that every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who has the use of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is adapted to obtain <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, because he can prepare himself for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> whereby to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> [Cf. I-II, 109, 5 and 6]; so that if he fail in this, his grief will be very great, since he has lost what he was able to possess. But children were never adapted to possess <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, since neither was this due to them by virtue of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> principles, for it surpasses the entire faculty of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, nor could they perform acts of their own whereby to obtain so great a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Hence they will nowise grieve for being deprived of the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">divine vision</a>; nay, rather will they rejoice for that they will have a large share of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and their own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> perfections. Nor can it be said that they were adapted to obtain <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, not indeed by their own action, but by the actions of others around them, since they could be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by others, like other children of the same <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> who have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and obtained <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>: for this is of superabundant <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that one should be rewarded without any act of one's own. Wherefore the lack of such a <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> will not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> sorrow in children who die without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, any more than the lack of many graces accorded to others of the same <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> makes a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to grieve.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In those who, having the use of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, are damned for actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, there was aptitude to obtain eternal life, but not in children, as stated above. Consequently there is no parity between the two.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> may be directed both to the possible and to the impossible as stated in Ethic. iii, 5, an ordinate and complete <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is only of things which in some way are proportionate to our capability; and we grieve if we fail to obtain this will, but not if we fail in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> that is of impossibilities, and which should be called "velleity" [Cf. I-II, 13, 5, ad 1; III, 21, 4] rather than "will"; for one does not will such things absolutely, but one would if they were possible.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Everyone has a claim to his own inheritance or bodily members, wherefore it is not strange that he should grieve at their loss, whether this be through his own or another's fault: hence it is clear that the argument is not based on a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> comparison.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> surpasses the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, as stated in <a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse15">Romans 5:15, seqq.</a>. Hence it does not follow that unbaptized children have as much of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> have of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Although unbaptized children are separated from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as regards the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">union of glory</a>, they are not utterly separated from Him: in fact they are united to Him by their share of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> goods, and so will also be able to rejoice in Him by their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.
