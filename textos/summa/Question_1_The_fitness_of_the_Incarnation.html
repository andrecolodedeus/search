<h1>Question 1. The fitness of the Incarnation</h1>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether it was fitting that God should become incarnate?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it was not fitting for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to become <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>. Since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, it was best for Him to be as He had been from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. But from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> He had been without flesh. Therefore it was most fitting for Him not to be united to flesh. Therefore it was not fitting for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to become <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is not fitting to unite things that are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> apart, even as it would not be a fitting union if one were "to paint a figure in which the neck of a horse was joined to the head of a man" [Horace, Ars. Poet., line 1]. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and flesh are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> apart; since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is most simple, and flesh is most composite--especially <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh. Therefore it was not fitting that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should be united to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a body is as distant from the highest spirit as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is from the highest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But it was wholly unfitting that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is the highest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, should assume <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore it was not fitting that the highest uncreated spirit should assume a body.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it is not becoming that He Who surpassed the greatest things should be contained in the least, and He upon Whom rests the care of great things should leave them for lesser things. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>--Who takes care of the whole world--the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> of things cannot contain. Therefore it would seem unfitting that "He should be hid under the frail body of a babe in swathing bands, in comparison with Whom the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is accounted as little; and that this Prince should quit His throne for so long, and transfer the government of the whole world to so frail a body," as Volusianus writes to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Ep. cxxxv).

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It would seem most fitting that by visible things the invisible things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; for to this end was the whole world made, as is clear from the word of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse20">Romans 1:20</a>): "For the invisible things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> . . . are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made." But, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 1), by the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> are made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> at once the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, the wisdom, the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and the power or might of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>--"His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, for He did not despise the weakness of His own handiwork; His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, since, on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> defeat, He <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> the tyrant to be overcome by none other than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and yet He did not snatch men forcibly from death; His wisdom, for He found a suitable discharge for a most heavy debt; His power, or <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> might, for there is nothing greater than for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to become <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a> . . ."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> To each things, that is befitting which belongs to it by reason of its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; thus, to reason befits <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, since this belongs to him because he is of a rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, as is clear from <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. i). Hence, what belongs to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> befits <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> to communicate itself to others, as is plain from <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. iv). Hence it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the highest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to communicate itself in the highest manner to the creature, and this is brought about chiefly by "His so joining <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to Himself that one Person is made up of these three--the Word, a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and flesh," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiii). Hence it is manifest that it was fitting that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should become <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> was not completed through <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> being changed in any way from the state in which He had been from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, but through His having united Himself to the creature in a new way, or rather through having united it to Himself. But it is fitting that a creature which by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is mutable, should not always be in one way. And therefore, as the creature began to be, although it had not been before, so likewise, not having been previously united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in Person, it was afterwards united to Him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> To be united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in unity of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> was not fitting to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh, according to its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> endowments, since it was above its dignity; nevertheless, it was fitting that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by reason of His <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, should unite it to Himself for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Every mode of being wherein any creature whatsoever differs from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a> has been established by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> wisdom, and is ordained to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is uncreated, immutable, and incorporeal, produced mutable and corporeal creatures for His own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. And so also the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of punishment was established by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. But <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of fault is committed by withdrawing from the art of the Divine wisdom and from the order of the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. And therefore it could be fitting to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to assume a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>, mutable, corporeal, and subject to penalty, but it did not become Him to assume the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of fault.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> replies (Ep. ad Volusian. 137): "The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> doctrine nowhere holds that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was so joined to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh as either to desert or lose, or to transfer and as it were, contract within this frail body, the care of governing the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. This is the thought of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> unable to see anything but corporeal things . . . <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is great not in mass, but in might. Hence the greatness of His might feels no straits in narrow surroundings. Nor, if the passing word of a man is heard at once by many, and wholly by each, is it incredible that the abiding <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> should be everywhere at once?" Hence nothing unfitting arises from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> becoming <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether it was necessary for the restoration of the human race that the Word of God should become incarnate?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it was not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the reparation of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> should become <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>. For since the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is perfect <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as has been said (I, 4, 1; I, 4, 2), no power was added to Him by the assumption of flesh. Therefore, if the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a> <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> restored <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. He could also have restored it without assuming flesh.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, for the restoration of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which had fallen through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, nothing more is required than that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should satisfy for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can satisfy, as it would seem, for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot require from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> more than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can do, and since He is more inclined to be merciful than to punish, as He lays the act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> charge, so He ought to credit him with the contrary act. Therefore it was not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the restoration of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> should become <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to revere <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> pertains especially to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; hence it is written (<a href="../bible/mal001.htm#verse6">Malachi 1:6</a>): "If, then, I be a father, where is my <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>? and if I be a master, where is my fear?" But men revere <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the more by considering Him as elevated above all, and far beyond <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> senses, hence (<a href="../bible/psa112.htm#verse4">Psalm 112:4</a>) it is written: "The Lord is high above all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, and His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> above the heavens"; and farther on: "Who is as the Lord our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>?" which pertains to reverence. Therefore it would seem unfitting to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should be made like unto us by assuming flesh.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> What frees the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> from perdition is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> is such; according to <a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse16">John 3:16</a>: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> so loved the world as to give His only-begotten Son, that whosoever <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> in Him may not perish, but may have life everlasting." Therefore it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should become <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing is said to be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for a certain end in two ways. First, when the end cannot be without it; as food is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the preservation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life. Secondly, when the end is attained better and more conveniently, as a horse is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for a journey. In the first way it was not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should become <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a> for the restoration of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with His <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> power could have restored <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in many other ways. But in the second way it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should become <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a> for the restoration of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xii, 10): "We shall also show that other ways were not wanting to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to Whose power all things are equally subject; but that there was not a more fitting way of healing our misery."

<p>Now this may be viewed with respect to our "furtherance in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." First, with regard to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which is made more <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> by <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself Who speaks; hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xi, 2): "In order that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> might journey more trustfully toward the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the Truth itself, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, having assumed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, established and founded <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>." Secondly, with regard to <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, which is thereby greatly strengthened; hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiii): "Nothing was so <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for raising our hope as to show us how deeply <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> loved us. And what could afford us a stronger <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this than that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> should become a partner with us of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>?" Thirdly, with regard to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which is greatly enkindled by this; hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Catech. Rudib. iv): "What greater <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is there of the Lord's coming than to show <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> love for us?" And he afterwards adds: "If we have been slow to love, at least let us hasten to love in return." Fourthly, with regard to well-doing, in which He set us an example; hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a sermon (xxii de Temp.): "Man who might be seen was not to be followed; but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was to be followed, Who could not be seen. And therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that He Who might be seen by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and Whom <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> might follow, might be shown to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." Fifthly, with regard to the full participation of the Divinity, which is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> bliss of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life; and this is bestowed upon us by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> humanity; for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a sermon (xiii de Temp.): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> might be made <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p>So also was this useful for our "withdrawal from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." First, because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is taught by it not to prefer the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> to himself, nor to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> him who is the author of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiii, 17): "Since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is so united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as to become one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, let not these <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> spirits dare to prefer themselves to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, because they have no bodies." Secondly, because we are thereby taught how great is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> dignity, lest we should sully it with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Vera Relig. xvi): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to us how high a place <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> holds amongst creatures, inasmuch as He appeared to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> as a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." And Pope Leo says in a sermon on the Nativity (xxi): "Learn, O <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, thy worth; and being made a partner of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, refuse to return by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> to your former worthlessness." Thirdly, because, "in order to do away with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> presumption, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is commended in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, though no <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> of ours went before," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiii, 17). Fourthly, because "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, which is the greatest stumbling-block to our clinging to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, can be convinced and cured by <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> so great," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in the same place. Fifthly, in order to free <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from the thraldom of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiii, 13), "ought to be done in such a way that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> should be overcome by the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>," and this was done by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> satisfying for us. Now a mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> could not have satisfied for the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was not bound to satisfy; hence it behooved <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> to be both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Hence Pope Leo says in the same sermon: "Weakness is assumed by strength, lowliness by majesty, mortality by <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, in order that one and the same Mediator of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and men might die in one and rise in the other--for this was our fitting remedy. Unless He was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He would not have brought a remedy; and unless He was <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, He would not have set an example."

<p>And there are very many other advantages which accrued, above <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> apprehension.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This reason has to do with the first kind of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, without which we cannot attain to the end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Satisfaction may be said to be sufficient in two ways--first, perfectly, inasmuch as it is condign, being adequate to make <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> the fault committed, and in this way the satisfaction of a mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot be sufficient for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, both because the whole of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> has been corrupted by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, whereas the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> could not be made up adequately for the harm done to the whole of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and also because a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has a kind of <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> from the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> of the Divine majesty, because the greater the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> we offend, the more grievous the offense. Hence for condign satisfaction it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the act of the one satisfying should have an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> efficiency, as being of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Secondly, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> satisfaction may be termed sufficient, imperfectly--i.e. in the acceptation of him who is content with it, even though it is not condign, and in this way the satisfaction of a mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is sufficient. And forasmuch as every imperfect presupposes some perfect thing, by which it is sustained, hence it is that satisfaction of every mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has its efficiency from the satisfaction of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> By taking flesh, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> did not lessen His majesty; and in consequence did not lessen the reason for reverencing Him, which is increased by the increase of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Him. But, on the contrary, inasmuch as He wished to draw nigh to us by taking flesh, He greatly drew us to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether, if man had not sinned, God would have become incarnate?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would still have become <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> remaining, the effect also remains. But as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiii, 17): "Many other things are to be considered in <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> besides <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>"; and these were discussed above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Therefore if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would have become <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it belongs to the omnipotence of the Divine power to perfect His works, and to manifest Himself by some <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> effect. But no mere creature can be called an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> effect, since it is finite of its very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Now, seemingly, in the work of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> alone is an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> effect of the Divine power manifested in a special manner by which power things <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> distant are united, inasmuch as it has been brought about that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And in this work especially the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> would seem to be perfected, inasmuch as the last creature--viz. <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>--is united to the first principle--viz. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore, even if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would have become <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> has not been made more capable of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> it is capable of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of union, which is the greatest <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore, if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> would have been capable of this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; nor would <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> have withheld from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> any <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> it was capable of. Therefore, if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would have become <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. But it is said of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse4">Romans 1:4</a>): "Who was predestined the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> in power." Therefore, even before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> should become <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>, in order to fulfil <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> was revealed to the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as is plain from <a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse23">Genesis 2:23</a>. "This now is bone of my bones," etc. which the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says is "a great sacrament . . . in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>," as is plain from <a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse32">Ephesians 5:32</a>. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> could not be fore-conscious of his fall, for the same reason that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> could not, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> proves (Gen. ad lit. xi, 18). Therefore, even if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would have become <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Verb. Apost. viii, 2), expounding what is set down in <a href="../bible/luk019.htm#verse10">Luke 19:10</a>, "For the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> is come to seek and to save that which was lost"; "Therefore, if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> would not have come." And on <a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse15">1 Timothy 1:15</a>, "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a> came into this world to save sinners," a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says, "There was no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> coming into the world, except to save sinners. Take away diseases, take away wounds, and there is no need of medicine."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There are different opinions about this question. For some say that even if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> would have become incarnate. Others assert the contrary, and seemingly our assent ought rather to be given to this opinion.

<p>For such things as spring from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will, and beyond the creature's due, can be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us only through being revealed in the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Sacred Scripture</a>, in which the Divine Will is made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us. Hence, since everywhere in the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Sacred Scripture</a> the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is assigned as the reason of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, it is more in accordance with this to say that the work of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> was ordained by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as a remedy for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; so that, had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> would not have been. And yet the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not limited to this; even had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> could have become <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> All the other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> which are assigned in the preceding article have to do with a remedy for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, he would have been endowed with the light of Divine wisdom, and would have been perfected by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> in order to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and carry out everything needful. But because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, on deserting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, had stooped to corporeal things, it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should take flesh, and by corporeal things should afford him the remedy of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Hence, on <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John 1:14</a>, "And the Word was made flesh," <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> says (Tract. ii): "Flesh had blinded thee, flesh heals thee; for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> came and overthrew the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> of the flesh."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> of Divine power is shown in the mode of production of things from nothing. Again, it suffices for the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> that the creature be ordained in a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> manner to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as to an end. But that a creature should be united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> exceeds the limits of the perfection of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A double capability may be remarked in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: one, in respect of the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power, and this is always fulfilled by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who apportions to each according to its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> capability; the other in respect to the order of the Divine power, which all creatures implicitly obey; and the capability we speak of pertains to this. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not fulfil all such capabilities, otherwise <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> could do only what He has done in creatures, and this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, as stated above (I, 105, 6). But there is no reason why <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> should not have been raised to something greater after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> allows <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> to happen in order to bring a greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> therefrom; hence it is written (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse20">Romans 5:20</a>): "Where <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> abounded, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> did more abound." Hence, too, in the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> of the Paschal candle, we say: "O <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> fault, that <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> such and so great a Redeemer!"

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Predestination presupposes the foreknowledge of future things; and hence, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> predestines the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of anyone to be brought about by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of others, so also He predestined the work of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> to be the remedy of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Nothing prevents an effect from being revealed to one to whom the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is not revealed. Hence, the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> could be revealed to the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> without his being fore-conscious of his fall. For not everyone who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the effect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether God became incarnate in order to take away actual sin, rather than to take away original sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> became <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a> as a remedy for actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> rather than for <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. For the more grievous the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the more it runs counter to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, for which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> became <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>. But actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is more grievous than <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>; for the lightest punishment is due to <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Julian. v, 11). Therefore <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is chiefly directed to taking away actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, pain of sense is not due to <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, but merely pain of loss, as has been shown (I-II, 87, 5). But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> came to suffer the pain of sense on the Cross in satisfaction for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>--and not the pain of loss, for He had no defect of either the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a> or fruition. Therefore He came in order to take away actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> rather than <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (De Compunctione Cordis ii, 3): "This must be the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the faithful servant, to account the benefits of his Lord, which have been bestowed on all alike, as though they were bestowed on himself alone. For as if speaking of himself alone, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> writes to the Galatians (<a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse20">2:20</a>): '<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> . . . loved me and delivered Himself for me.'" But our <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; for <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is the common <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore we ought to have this conviction, so as to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He has come chiefly for actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse29">John 1:29</a>): "Behold the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, behold Him Who taketh away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: '<a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>'] of the world."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> came into this world not only to take away that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is handed on originally to posterity, but also in order to take away all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> subsequently added to it; not that all are taken away (and this is from men's fault, inasmuch as they do not adhere to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse19">John 3:19</a>: "The light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than the light"), but because He offered what was sufficient for blotting out all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse15">Romans 5:15-16</a>): "But not as the offense, so also the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> . . . For judgment indeed was by one unto condemnation, but <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is of many offenses unto <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>."

<p>Moreover, the more grievous the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the more particularly did <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> come to blot it out. But "greater" is said in two ways: in one way "intensively," as a more intense whiteness is said to be greater, and in this way actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is greater than <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>; for it has more of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, as has been shown (I-II, 81, 1). In another way a thing is said to be greater "extensively," as whiteness on a greater superficies is said to be greater; and in this way <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, whereby the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> is infected, is greater than any actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is proper to one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. And in this respect <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> came principally to take away <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, inasmuch as "the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the race is a more Divine thing than the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>," as is said Ethic. i, 2.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This reason looks to the intensive greatness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In the future award the pain of sense will not be meted out to <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. Yet the penalties, such as hunger, thirst, death, and the like, which we suffer sensibly in this life flow from <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. And hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in order to satisfy fully for <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, wished to suffer sensible pain, that He might consume death and the like in Himself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (De Compunctione Cordis ii, 6): "The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> used these words, not as if wishing to diminish <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, ample as they are, and spreading throughout the whole world, but that he might account himself alone the occasion of them. For what does it matter that they are given to others, if what are given to you are as complete and perfect as if none of them were given to another than yourself?" And hence, although a man ought to account <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> as given to himself, yet he ought not to consider them not to be given to others. And thus we do not exclude that He came to wipe away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> rather than the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is as perfectly healed in each one as if it were healed in him alone. Hence, on account of the union of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, what is vouchsafed to all ought to be accounted his own by each one.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether it was fitting that God should become incarnate in the beginning of the human race?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it was fitting that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should become <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a> in the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. For the work of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> sprang from the immensity of Divine <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, according to <a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse4">Ephesians 2:4-5</a>: "But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (Who is rich in mercy), for His exceeding <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> wherewith He loved us . . . even when we were dead in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, hath quickened us together in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." But <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> does not tarry in bringing assistance to a friend who is suffering need, according to <a href="../bible/pro003.htm#verse28">Proverbs 3:28</a>: "Say not to thy friend: Go, and come again, and tomorrow I will give to thee, when thou canst give at present." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> ought not to have put off the work of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, but ought thereby to have brought relief to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> from the beginning.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse15">1 Timothy 1:15</a>): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a> came into this world to save sinners." But more would have been saved had <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> become <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a> at the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>; for in the various centuries very many, through not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, perished in their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore it was fitting that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should become <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a> at the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the work of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not less orderly than the work of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> takes its rise with the more perfect, as <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Consol. iii). Therefore the work of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> ought to have been perfect from the beginning. But in the work of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> we see the perfection of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John 1:14</a>: "The Word was made flesh"; and afterwards it is added: "Full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> ought to have become <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a> at the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse4">Galatians 4:4</a>): "But when the fulness of the time was come, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, made under the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>": upon which a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says that "the fulness of the time is when it was decreed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father to send His Son." But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> decreed everything by His wisdom. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> became <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a> at the most fitting time; and it was not fitting that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should become <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a> at the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since the work of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> is principally ordained to the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> by blotting out <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it is manifest that it was not fitting for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to become <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a> at the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For medicine is given only to the sick. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> Himself says (<a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse12">Matthew 9:12-13</a>): "They that are in health need not a physician, but they that are ill . . . For I am not come to call the just, but sinners."

<p>Nor was it fitting that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should become <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a> immediately after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. First, on account of the manner of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which had come of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>; hence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was to be liberated in such a manner that he might be <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a>, and see how he stood in need of a deliverer. Hence on the words in <a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse19">Galatians 3:19</a>, "Being ordained by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in the hand of a mediator," a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "With great wisdom was it so ordered that the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> should not be sent immediately after <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> fall. For first of all <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> left <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> under the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, with the freedom of his will, in order that he might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> strength; and when he failed in it, he received the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; whereupon, by the fault, not of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, but of his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the disease gained strength; so that having recognized his infirmity he might cry out for a physician, and beseech the aid of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>."

<p>Secondly, on account of the order of furtherance in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, whereby we proceed from imperfection to perfection. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse46">1 Corinthians 15:46-47</a>): "Yet that was not first which is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, but that which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>; afterwards that which is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> . . . The first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was of the earth, earthy; the second <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, heavenly."

<p>Thirdly, on account of the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a> Word, for on the words (<a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse4">Galatians 4:4</a>), "But when the fulness of the time was come," a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "The greater the judge who was coming, the more numerous was the band of heralds who ought to have preceded him."

<p>Fourthly, lest the fervor of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> should cool by the length of time, for the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of many will grow cold at the end of the world. Hence (<a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse8">Luke 18:8</a>) it is written: "But yet the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, when He cometh, shall He find think you, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> on earth?"

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> does not put off bringing assistance to a friend: always bearing in mind the circumstances as well as the state of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. For if the physician were to give the medicine at the very outset of the ailment, it would do less <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and would hurt rather than benefit. And hence the Lord did not bestow upon the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> the remedy of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> in the beginning, lest they should despise it through <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, if they did not already recognize their disease.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> replies to this (De Sex Quest. Pagan., Ep. cii), saying (2) that "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> wished to appear to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and to have His doctrine preached to them when and where He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> those were who would <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him. But in such times and places as His Gospel was not preached He foresaw that not all, indeed, but many would so bear themselves towards His preaching as not to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in His corporeal presence, even were He to raise the dead." But the same <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, taking exception to this reply in his book (De Perseverantia ix), says: "How can we say the inhabitants of Tyre and Sidon would not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> when such great wonders were wrought in their midst, or would not have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> had they been wrought, when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself bears witness that they would have done penance with great <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> if these signs of Divine power had been wrought in their midst?" And he adds in answer (De Perseverantia xi): "Hence, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse16">Romans 9:16</a>), 'it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth, but of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that showeth mercy'; Who (succors whom He will of) those who, as He foresaw, would <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> if wrought amongst them, (while others) He succors not, having judged them in His <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> secretly yet <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>. Therefore let us unshrinkingly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> His mercy to be with those who are set free, and His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> with those who are condemned." [The words in brackets are not in the text of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Perfection is prior to imperfection, both in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, in things that are different (for what brings others to perfection must itself be perfect); but in one and the same, imperfection is prior in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> though posterior in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. And thus the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> perfection of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> precedes in duration the imperfection of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; but the latter's ultimate perfection in union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> follows.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether Incarnation ought to have been put off till the end of the world?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the work of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> ought to have been put off till the end of the world. For it is written (<a href="../bible/psa091.htm#verse11">Psalm 91:11</a>): "My old age in plentiful mercy"--i.e. "in the last days," as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says. But the time of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> is especially the time of mercy, according to <a href="../bible/psa101.htm#verse14">Psalm 101:14</a>: "For it is time to have mercy on it." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> ought to have been put off till the end of the world.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as has been said (5, ad 3), in the same subject, perfection is subsequent in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> to imperfection. Therefore, what is most perfect ought to be the very last in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. But the highest perfection of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is in the union with the Word, because "in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> it hath pleased the Father that all the fulness of the Godhead should dwell," as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse9">Colossians 1:19</a>, and <a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse9">2:9</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> ought to have been put off till the end of the world.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, what can be done by one ought not to be done by two. But the one coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> at the end of the world was sufficient for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore it was not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for Him to come beforehand in His <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>; and hence <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> ought to have been put off till the end of the world.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/hab003.htm#verse2">Habakkuk 3:2</a>): "In the midst of the years Thou shalt make it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> which was made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the world ought not to have been put off till the end of the world.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As it was not fitting that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should become <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a> at the beginning of the world, so also it was not fitting that the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> should be put off till the end of the world. And this is shown first from the union of the Divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For, as it has been said (5, ad 3), perfection precedes imperfection in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> in one way, and contrariwise in another way imperfection precedes perfection. For in that which is made perfect from being imperfect, imperfection precedes perfection in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, whereas in that which is the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of perfection, perfection precedes imperfection in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Now in the work of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> both concur; for by <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is raised to its highest perfection; and in this way it was not becoming that <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> should take place at the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. And the Word <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a> is the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse16">John 1:16</a>: "Of His fulness we have all received"; and hence the work of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> ought not to have been put off till the end of the world. But the perfection of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is to be finally raised by the Word Incarnate will be at the end of the world.

<p>Secondly, from the effect of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; for, as is said Qq. Vet et Nov. Test., qu. 83, "it is in the power of the Giver to have pity when, or as much as, He wills. Hence He came when He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it was fitting to succor, and when His boons would be welcome. For when by the feebleness of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> men's <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> began to grow dim and their morals lax, He was pleased to choose <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> as a standard of the restored <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> living; and later on when reverence grew weaker, He gave the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in writing; and because the gentiles despised it and would not take it upon themselves, and they who received it would not keep it, being touched with pity, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, to grant to all remission of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and to offer them, justified, to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father." But if this remedy had been put off till the end of the world, all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and reverence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and all uprightness of morals would have been swept away from the earth.

<p>Thirdly, this appears fitting to the manifestation of the Divine power, which has saved men in several ways--not only by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in some future thing, but also by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in something present and past.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> has in view the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which leads us to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Nevertheless, if it is referred to the mercy shown the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> by <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, we must reflect that, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Retract. i), the time of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> may be compared to the youth of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, "on account of the strength and fervor of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which works by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>"; and to old age--i.e. the sixth age--on account of the number of centuries, for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> came in the sixth age. And although youth and old age cannot be together in a body, yet they can be together in a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the former on account of quickness, the latter on account of gravity. And hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says elsewhere (Qq. lxxxiii, qu. 44) that "it was not becoming that the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Master</a> by Whose imitation the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> was to be formed to the highest <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> should come from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, save in the time of youth." But in another work (De Gen. cont. Manich. i, 23) he says: that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> came in the sixth age--i.e. in the old age--of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The work of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> is to be viewed not as merely the terminus of a movement from imperfection to perfection, but also as a principle of perfection to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as has been said.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says on <a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse11">John 3:11</a>, "For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent not His Son into the world to judge the world" (Hom. xxviii): "There are two comings of Christ: the first, for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; the second, to judge the world. For if He had not done so, all would have perished together, since all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> and need the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Hence it is plain that He ought not to have put off the coming in mercy till the end of the world.
