<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether, besides philosophy, any further doctrine is required?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that, besides <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical science</a>, we have no need of any further <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should not seek to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is above <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>: "Seek not the things that are too high for thee" (<a href="../bible/sir003.htm#verse22">Sirach 3:22</a>). But whatever is not above <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> is fully treated of in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical science</a>. Therefore any other <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> besides <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical science</a> is superfluous.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> can be concerned only with being, for nothing can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, save what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; and all that is, is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. But everything that is, is treated of in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical science</a>--even <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself; so that there is a part of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> called <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, or the divine science, as <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> has proved (Metaph. vi). Therefore, besides <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical science</a>, there is no need of any further <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse16">2 Timothy 3:16</a>): "All <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>, <a href="../cathen/08045a.htm">inspired</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is profitable to teach, to reprove, to correct, to instruct in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>, <a href="../cathen/08045a.htm">inspired</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is no part of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical science</a>, which has been built up by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Therefore it is useful that besides <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical science</a>, there should be other <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, i.e. <a href="../cathen/08045a.htm">inspired</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> that there should be a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> besides <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical science</a> built up by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Firstly, indeed, because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as to an end that surpasses the grasp of his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>: "The eye hath not seen, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, besides Thee, what things Thou hast prepared for them that wait for Thee" (<a href="../bible/isa064.htm#verse4">Isaiah 64:4</a>). But the end must first be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who are to direct their thoughts and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">actions</a> to the end. Hence it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that certain <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> which exceed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> should be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to him by <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">divine revelation</a>. Even as regards those <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> could have discovered, it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be taught by a <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">divine revelation</a>; because the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> such as <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> could discover, would only be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by a few, and that after a long time, and with the admixture of many <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. Whereas <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> whole <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, which is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, depends upon the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Therefore, in order that the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> might be brought about more fitly and more surely, it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that they should be taught divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> by <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">divine revelation</a>. It was therefore <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that besides <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical science</a> built up by <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, there should be a sacred science learned through <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although those things which are beyond <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> may not be sought for by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> through his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, nevertheless, once they are <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they must be accepted by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">sacred text</a> continues, "For many things are shown to thee above the understanding of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" (<a href="../bible/sir003.htm#verse25">Sirach 3:25</a>). And in this, the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">sacred science</a> consists.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Sciences are differentiated according to the various means through which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is obtained. For the <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12047a.htm">physicist</a> both may prove the same conclusion: that the earth, for instance, is round: the <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a> by means of mathematics (i.e. abstracting from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>), but the <a href="../cathen/12047a.htm">physicist</a> by means of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> itself. Hence there is no reason why those things which may be learned from <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical science</a>, so far as they can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, may not also be taught us by another science so far as they fall within <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> included in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">sacred doctrine</a> differs in kind from that <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> which is part of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether sacred doctrine is a science?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">sacred doctrine</a> is not a science. For every science proceeds from self-evident principles. But <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">sacred doctrine</a> proceeds from <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a> which are not self-evident, since their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not admitted by all: "For all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> have not <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>" (<a href="../bible/2th003.htm#verse2">2 Thessalonians 3:2</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">sacred doctrine</a> is not a science.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no science deals with individual facts. But this <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">sacred science</a> treats of individual facts, such as the deeds of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> and <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> and such like. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">sacred doctrine</a> is not a science.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiv, 1) "to this science alone belongs that whereby saving <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is begotten, nourished, protected and strengthened." But this can be said of no science except <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">sacred doctrine</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">sacred doctrine</a> is a science.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Sacred doctrine</a> is a science. We must bear in mind that there are two kinds of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. There are some which proceed from a principle known by the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> light of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>, such as arithmetic and geometry and the like. There are some which proceed from principles known by the light of a higher science: thus the science of perspective proceeds from principles established by geometry, and music from principles established by arithmetic. So it is that <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">sacred doctrine</a> is a science because it proceeds from principles established by the light of a higher science, namely, the science of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">blessed</a>. Hence, just as the musician accepts on authority the principles taught him by the mathematician, so <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">sacred science</a> is established on principles <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The principles of any science are either in themselves self-evident, or reducible to the conclusions of a higher science; and such, as we have said, are the principles of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">sacred doctrine</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Individual facts are treated of in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">sacred doctrine</a>, not because it is concerned with them principally, but they are introduced rather both as examples to be followed in our lives (as in <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral sciences</a>) and in order to establish the authority of those <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> through whom the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">divine revelation</a>, on which this <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">sacred scripture</a> or <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is based, has come down to us.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether sacred doctrine is one science?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">sacred doctrine</a> is not one science; for according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Poster. i) "that science is one which treats only of one class of subjects." But the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">creator</a> and the creature, both of whom are treated of in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">sacred doctrine</a>, cannot be grouped together under one class of subjects. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">sacred doctrine</a> is not one science.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">sacred doctrine</a> we treat of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, corporeal creatures and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morality</a>. But these belong to separate <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical sciences</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">sacred doctrine</a> cannot be one science.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Scripture</a> speaks of it as one science: "Wisdom gave him the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> [scientiam] of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things" (<a href="../bible/wis010.htm#verse10">Wisdom 10:10</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Sacred doctrine</a> is one science. The unity of a <a href="../cathen/05749a.htm">faculty</a> or <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is to be gauged by its object, not indeed, in its material aspect, but as regards the precise formality under which it is an object. For example, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, ass, stone agree in the one precise formality of being colored; and color is the formal object of sight. Therefore, because <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Sacred Scripture</a> considers things precisely under the formality of being <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">divinely revealed</a>, whatever has been <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">divinely revealed</a> possesses the one precise formality of the object of this science; and therefore is included under <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">sacred doctrine</a> as under one science.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Sacred doctrine</a> does not treat of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and creatures equally, but of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> primarily, and of creatures only so far as they are referable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as their beginning or end. Hence the unity of this science is not impaired.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Nothing prevents inferior <a href="../cathen/05749a.htm">faculties</a> or <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> from being differentiated by something which falls under a higher <a href="../cathen/05749a.htm">faculty</a> or <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> as well; because the higher <a href="../cathen/05749a.htm">faculty</a> or <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> regards the object in its more universal formality, as the object of the <a href="../cathen/04167a.htm">"common sense"</a> is whatever affects the senses, including, therefore, whatever is visible or audible. Hence the <a href="../cathen/04167a.htm">"common sense"</a>, although one <a href="../cathen/05749a.htm">faculty</a>, extends to all the objects of the five senses. Similarly, objects which are the subject-matter of different <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical sciences</a> can yet be treated of by this one single <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">sacred science</a> under one aspect precisely so far as they can be included in <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>. So that in this way, <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">sacred doctrine</a> bears, as it were, the stamp of the divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">science</a> which is one and simple, yet extends to everything.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether sacred doctrine is a practical science?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">sacred doctrine</a> is a practical science; for a practical science is that which ends in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">action</a> according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. ii). But <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">sacred doctrine</a> is ordained to <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">action</a>: "Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only" (<a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse22">James 1:22</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">sacred doctrine</a> is a practical science.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">sacred doctrine</a> is divided into the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>. But <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> implies a <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral science</a> which is a practical science. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">sacred doctrine</a> is a practical science.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Every practical science is concerned with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> operations; as <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral science</a> is concerned with <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, and architecture with buildings. But <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">sacred doctrine</a> is chiefly concerned with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose handiwork is especially <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore it is not a practical but a speculative science.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Sacred doctrine</a>, being one, extends to things which belong to different <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical sciences</a> because it considers in each the same formal aspect, namely, so far as they can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">divine revelation</a>. Hence, although among the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical sciences</a> one is speculative and another practical, nevertheless <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">sacred doctrine</a> includes both; as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by one and the same <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">science</a>, knows both Himself and His works. Still, it is speculative rather than practical because it is more concerned with divine things than with <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>; though it does treat even of these latter, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is ordained by them to the perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in which consists <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">eternal bliss</a>. This is a sufficient answer to the Objections.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether sacred doctrine is nobler than other sciences?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">sacred doctrine</a> is not nobler than other <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>; for the nobility of a science depends on the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> it establishes. But other <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, the principles of which cannot be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a>, seem to be more <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> than <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">sacred doctrine</a>; for its principles &mdash; namely, <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a> &mdash; can be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a>. Therefore other <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> seem to be nobler.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is the sign of a lower science to depend upon a higher; as music depends on arithmetic. But <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">sacred doctrine</a> does in a sense depend upon <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical sciences</a>; for <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> observes, in his Epistle to Magnus, that "the ancient <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> so enriched their books with the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and phrases of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, that thou <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowest</a> not what more to admire in them, their profane erudition or their <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scriptural</a> learning." Therefore <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">sacred doctrine</a> is inferior to other <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Other <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> are called the handmaidens of this one: "Wisdom sent her maids to invite to the tower" (<a href="../bible/pro009.htm#verse3">Proverbs 9:3</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since this science is partly speculative and partly practical, it transcends all others speculative and practical. Now one speculative science is said to be nobler than another, either by reason of its greater <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a>, or by reason of the higher worth of its subject-<a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. In both these respects this science surpasses other speculative <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>; in point of greater <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a>, because other <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> derive their <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> light of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, which can <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>; whereas this derives its <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> from the light of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">divine</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which cannot be misled: in point of the higher worth of its subject-matter because this science treats chiefly of those things which by their sublimity transcend <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>; while other <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> consider only those things which are within <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason's</a> grasp. Of the practical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, that one is nobler which is ordained to a further purpose, as political science is nobler than military science; for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the army is directed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the State. But the purpose of this science, in so far as it is practical, is <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">eternal bliss</a>; to which as to an ultimate end the purposes of every practical science are directed. Hence it is clear that from every standpoint, it is nobler than other <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It may well happen that what is in itself the more <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> may seem to us the less <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> on account of the weakness of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>, "which is dazzled by the clearest objects of nature; as the owl is dazzled by the light of the sun" (Metaph. ii, lect. i). Hence the fact that some happen to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a> is not due to the uncertain nature of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, but to the weakness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>; yet the slenderest <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that may be obtained of the highest things is more desirable than the most <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> obtained of lesser things, as is said in de Animalibus xi.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This science can in a sense depend upon the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical sciences</a>, not as though it stood in need of them, but only in order to make its teaching clearer. For it accepts its principles not from other <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, but immediately from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>. Therefore it does not depend upon other <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> as upon the higher, but makes use of them as of the lesser, and as handmaidens: even so the master <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> make use of the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> that supply their materials, as political of military science. That it thus uses them is not due to its own defect or insufficiency, but to the defect of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>, which is more easily led by what is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> (from which proceed the other <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>) to that which is above <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, such as are the teachings of this science.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether this doctrine is the same as wisdom?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is not the same as wisdom. For no <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> which borrows its principles is worthy of the name of wisdom; seeing that the wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> directs, and is not directed (Metaph. i). But this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> borrows its principles. Therefore this science is not wisdom.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is a part of wisdom to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the principles of other <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. Hence it is called the chief of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, as is clear in Ethic. vi. But this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the principles of other <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. Therefore it is not the same as wisdom.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is acquired by study, whereas wisdom is acquired by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> inspiration; so that it is numbered among the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> (<a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse2">Isaiah 11:2</a>). Therefore this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is not the same as wisdom.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/deu004.htm#verse6">Deuteronomy 4:6</a>): "This is your wisdom and understanding in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> This <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is wisdom above all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> wisdom; not merely in any one order, but absolutely. For since it is the part of a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to arrange and to judge, and since lesser matters should be judged in the light of some higher principle, he is said to be wise in any one order who considers the highest principle in that order: thus in the order of building, he who plans the form of the house is called wise and architect, in opposition to the inferior laborers who trim the wood and make ready the stones: "As a wise architect, I have laid the foundation" (<a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse10">1 Corinthians 3:10</a>). Again, in the order of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> man is called wise, inasmuch as he directs his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">acts</a> to a fitting end: "Wisdom is <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> to a man" (<a href="../bible/pro010.htm#verse23">Proverbs 10:23</a>). Therefore he who considers absolutely the highest <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, namely <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is most of all called wise. Hence wisdom is said to be the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of divine things, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xii, 14). But <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">sacred doctrine</a> essentially treats of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> viewed as the highest <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> &mdash; not only so far as He can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through creatures just as <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> knew Him &mdash; "That which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is manifest in them" (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse19">Romans 1:19</a>) &mdash; but also as far as He is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to Himself alone and <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> to others. Hence <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">sacred doctrine</a> is especially called wisdom.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Sacred doctrine</a> derives its principles not from any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but from the divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, through which, as through the highest wisdom, all our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is set in order.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The principles of other <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> either are evident and cannot be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, or are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> through some other science. But the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> proper to this science comes through <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> and not through <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Therefore it has no concern to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the principles of other <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, but only to judge of them. Whatsoever is found in other <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> contrary to any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of this science must be condemned as <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>: "Destroying counsels and every height that exalteth itself against the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/2co010.htm#verse4">2 Corinthians 10:4-5</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Since judgment appertains to wisdom, the twofold manner of judging produces a twofold wisdom. A man may judge in one way by inclination, as whoever has the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> judges rightly of what concerns that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> by his very inclination towards it. Hence it is the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> man, as we read, who is the measure and rule of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>. In another way, by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, just as a man learned in <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral science</a> might be able to judge rightly about <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">acts</a>, though he had not the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. The first manner of judging divine things belongs to that wisdom which is set down among the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: "The spiritual <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> judgeth all things" (<a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse15">1 Corinthians 2:15</a>). And <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. ii): "<a href="../cathen/07345b.htm">Hierotheus</a> is taught not by mere learning, but by experience of divine things." The second manner of judging belongs to this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> which is acquired by study, though its principles are obtained by <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether God is the object of this science?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the object of this science. For in every science, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of its object is presupposed. But this science cannot presuppose the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. i, iv): "It is impossible to define the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the object of this science.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever conclusions are reached in any science must be comprehended under the object of the science. But in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> we reach conclusions not only concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but concerning many other things, such as creatures and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morality</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the object of this science.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The object of the science is that of which it principally treats. But in this science, the treatment is mainly about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for it is called <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, as treating of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the object of this science.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the object of this science. The relation between a science and its object is the same as that between a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> or <a href="../cathen/05749a.htm">faculty</a> and its object. Now properly speaking, the object of a <a href="../cathen/05749a.htm">faculty</a> or <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is the thing under the aspect of which all things are referred to that <a href="../cathen/05749a.htm">faculty</a> or <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and stone are referred to the faculty of sight in that they are colored. Hence colored things are the proper objects of sight. But in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">sacred science</a>, all things are treated of under the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: either because they are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself or because they refer to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as their beginning and end. Hence it follows that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the object of this science. This is clear also from the principles of this science, namely, the <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a>, for <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The object of the principles and of the whole science must be the same, since the whole science is contained virtually in its principles. Some, however, looking to what is treated of in this science, and not to the aspect under which it is treated, have asserted the object of this science to be something other than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> &mdash; that is, either things and signs; or the works of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; or the <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">whole Christ</a>, as the head and members. Of all these things, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, we treat in this science, but so far as they have reference to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although we cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in what consists the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nevertheless in this science we make use of His effects, either of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, in place of a definition, in regard to whatever is treated of in this science concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; even as in some <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical sciences</a> we demonstrate something about a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> from its effect, by taking the effect in place of a definition of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Whatever other conclusions are reached in this <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">sacred science</a> are comprehended under <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not as parts or <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> or <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> but as in some way related to Him.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether sacred doctrine is a matter of argument?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is not a matter of argument. For <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Fide 1): "Put arguments aside where <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is sought." But in this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> especially is sought: "But these things are written that you may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>" (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse31">John 20:31</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">sacred doctrine</a> is not a matter of argument.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if it is a matter of argument, the argument is either from authority or from <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. If it is from authority, it seems unbefitting its dignity, for the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> from authority is the weakest form of <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>. But if it is from <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, this is unbefitting its end, because, according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Hom. 26), "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has no <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> in those things of which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> brings its own experience." Therefore <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">sacred doctrine</a> is not a matter of argument.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> says that a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> should "embrace that faithful word which is according to <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, that he may be able to exhort in <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">sound doctrine</a> and to convince the gainsayers" (<a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse9">Titus 1:9</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As other <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> do not argue in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of their principles, but argue from their principles to demonstrate other <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> in these <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>: so this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> does not argue in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of its principles, which are the <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a>, but from them it goes on to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> something else; as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> from the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection of Christ</a> argues in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">general resurrection</a> (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm">1 Corinthians 15</a>). However, it is to be borne in mind, in regard to the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical sciences</a>, that the inferior <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> neither <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> their principles nor dispute with those who deny them, but leave this to a higher science; whereas the highest of them, viz. <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a>, can dispute with one who denies its principles, if only the opponent will make some concession; but if he concede nothing, it can have no dispute with him, though it can answer his objections. Hence <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Sacred Scripture</a>, since it has no science above itself, can dispute with one who denies its principles only if the opponent admits some at least of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> obtained through <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">divine revelation</a>; thus we can argue with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> from texts in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>, and against those who deny one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">article of faith</a>, we can argue from another. If our opponent <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> nothing of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">divine revelation</a>, there is no longer any means of <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proving</a> the <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a> by reasoning, but only of answering his objections &mdash; if he has any &mdash; against <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Since <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> rests upon <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and since the contrary of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> can never be demonstrated, it is clear that the arguments brought against <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> cannot be demonstrations, but are difficulties that can be answered.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although arguments from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> cannot avail to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> what must be received on <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, nevertheless, this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> argues from <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a> to other <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is especially based upon arguments from authority, inasmuch as its principles are obtained by <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>: thus we ought to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> on the authority of those to whom the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> has been made. Nor does this take away from the dignity of this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, for although the argument from authority based on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> is the weakest, yet the argument from authority based on <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">divine revelation</a> is the strongest. But <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">sacred doctrine</a> makes use even of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, not, indeed, to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (for thereby the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> would come to an end), but to make clear other things that are put forward in this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. Since therefore <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> does not destroy <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> but perfects it, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> should minister to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> bent of the will ministers to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says: "Bringing into captivity every understanding unto the obedience of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>" (<a href="../bible/2co010.htm#verse5">2 Corinthians 10:5</a>). Hence <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">sacred doctrine</a> makes use also of the authority of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> in those questions in which they were able to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> quotes a saying of Aratus: "As some also of your own poets said: For we are also His offspring" (<a href="../bible/act017.htm#verse28">Acts 17:28</a>). Nevertheless, <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">sacred doctrine</a> makes use of these authorities as extrinsic and probable arguments; but properly uses the authority of the <a href="../bible/index.html">canonical Scriptures</a> as an incontrovertible <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, and the authority of the <a href="../cathen/05075a.htm">doctors of the Church</a> as one that may properly be used, yet merely as probable. For our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> rests upon the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> made to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> who wrote the <a href="../bible/index.html">canonical books</a>, and not on the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelations</a> (if any such there are) made to other <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Epis. ad Hieron. xix, 1): "Only those books of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> which are called <a href="../cathen/03274a.htm">canonical</a> have I learned to hold in such honor as to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> their authors have not <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erred</a> in any way in writing them. But other authors I so read as not to deem everything in their works to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, merely on account of their having so thought and written, whatever may have been their <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and learning."

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether Holy Scripture should use metaphors?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Scripture</a> should not use metaphors. For that which is proper to the lowest science seems not to befit this science, which holds the highest place of all. But to proceed by the aid of various similitudes and figures is proper to poetry, the least of all the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. Therefore it is not fitting that this science should make use of such similitudes.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> seems to be intended to make <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> clear. Hence a reward is held out to those who manifest it: "They that explain me shall have <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">life everlasting</a>" (<a href="../bible/sir024.htm#verse31">Sirach 24:31</a>). But by such similitudes <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is obscured. Therefore, to put forward divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> by likening them to corporeal things does not befit this science.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the higher creatures are, the nearer they approach to the divine likeness. If therefore any creature be taken to represent <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, this representation ought chiefly to be taken from the higher creatures, and not from the lower; yet this is often found in <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/hos012.htm#verse10">Hosea 12:10</a>): "I have multiplied <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">visions</a>, and I have used similitudes by the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>." But to put forward anything by means of similitudes is to use metaphors. Therefore this <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">sacred science</a> may use metaphors.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is befitting <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> to put forward divine and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> by means of comparisons with material things. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> provides for everything according to the capacity of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to attain to <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> through sensible objects, because all our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> originates from sense. Hence in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>, <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> are fittingly taught under the likeness of material things. This is what <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. i): "We cannot be enlightened by the divine rays except they be hidden within the covering of many sacred veils." It is also befitting <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>, which is proposed to all without distinction of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> &mdash; "To the wise and to the unwise I am a debtor" (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse14">Romans 1:14</a>) &mdash; that <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> be expounded by means of figures taken from corporeal things, in order that thereby even the simple who are unable by themselves to grasp <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> things may be able to understand it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Poetry makes use of metaphors to produce a representation, for it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be pleased with representations. But <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">sacred doctrine</a> makes use of metaphors as both <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> and useful.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The ray of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">divine revelation</a> is not extinguished by the sensible imagery wherewith it is veiled, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. i); and its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> so far remains that it does not allow the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of those to whom the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> has been made, to rest in the metaphors, but raises them to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>; and through those to whom the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> has been made others also may receive instruction in these matters. Hence those things that are taught metaphorically in one part of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>, in other parts are taught more openly. The very hiding of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">figures</a> is useful for the exercise of thoughtful <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> and as a defense against the ridicule of the impious, according to the words "Give not that which is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> to dogs" (<a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse6">Matthew 7:6</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says, (Coel. Hier. i) it is more fitting that divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> should be expounded under the figure of less noble than of nobler bodies, and this for three reasons. Firstly, because thereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> are the better preserved from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. For then it is clear that these things are not literal descriptions of divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, which might have been open to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> had they been expressed under the figure of nobler bodies, especially for those who could think of nothing nobler than bodies. Secondly, because this is more befitting the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that we have in this life. For what He is not is clearer to us than what He is. Therefore similitudes drawn from things farthest away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> form within us a truer estimate that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is above whatsoever we may say or think of Him. Thirdly, because thereby divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> are the better hidden from the unworthy.

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether in Holy Scripture a word may have several senses?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> a word cannot have several senses, historical or literal, allegorical, <a href="../cathen/15066a.htm">tropological</a> or moral, and anagogical. For many different senses in one text produce confusion and deception and destroy all force of argument. Hence no argument, but only fallacies, can be <a href="../cathen/04674a.htm">deduced</a> from a multiplicity of propositions. But <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> ought to be able to state the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> without any fallacy. Therefore in it there cannot be several senses to a word.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De util. cred. iii) that "the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> has a fourfold division as to history, etiology, analogy and allegory." Now these four seem altogether different from the four divisions mentioned in the first objection. Therefore it does not seem fitting to explain the same word of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> according to the four different senses mentioned above.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, besides these senses, there is the parabolical, which is not one of these four.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (<a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">Moral</a>. xx, 1): "<a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> by the manner of its speech transcends every science, because in one and the same sentence, while it describes a fact, it <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">reveals</a> a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The author of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in whose power it is to signify His meaning, not by words only (as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> also can do), but also by things themselves. So, whereas in every other science things are signified by words, this science has the property, that the things signified by the words have themselves also a signification. Therefore that first signification whereby words signify things belongs to the first sense, the historical or literal. That signification whereby things signified by words have themselves also a signification is called the spiritual sense, which is based on the literal, and presupposes it. Now this spiritual sense has a threefold division. For as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse1">Hebrews 10:1</a>) the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> is a figure of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. i) "the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> itself is a figure of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">future glory</a>." Again, in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, whatever <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Head</a> has done is a <a href="../cathen/15107a.htm">type</a> of what we ought to do. Therefore, so far as the things of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> signify the things of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, there is the allegorical sense; so far as the things done in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or so far as the things which signify <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, are <a href="../cathen/15107a.htm">types</a> of what we ought to do, there is the <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> sense. But so far as they signify what relates to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal glory</a>, there is the anagogical sense. Since the literal sense is that which the author intends, and since the author of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who by one act comprehends all things by His <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, it is not unfitting, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. xii), if, even according to the literal sense, one word in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> should have several senses.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The multiplicity of these senses does not produce equivocation or any other kind of multiplicity, seeing that these senses are not multiplied because one word signifies several things, but because the things signified by the words can be themselves <a href="../cathen/15107a.htm">types</a> of other things. Thus in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> no confusion results, for all the senses are founded on one &mdash; the literal &mdash; from which alone can any argument be drawn, and not from those intended in allegory, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Epis. 48). Nevertheless, nothing of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Scripture</a> perishes on account of this, since nothing <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is contained under the spiritual sense which is not elsewhere put forward by the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> in its literal sense.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> These three &mdash; history, etiology, analogy &mdash; are grouped under the literal sense. For it is called history, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> expounds (Epis. 48), whenever anything is simply related; it is called etiology when its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is assigned, as when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> gave the reason why <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> allowed the <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">putting away of wives</a> &mdash; namely, on account of the hardness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> hearts; it is called analogy whenever the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of one text of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> is shown not to contradict the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of another. Of these four, allegory alone stands for the three spiritual senses. Thus <a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugh of St. Victor</a> (Sacram. iv, 4 Prolog.) includes the anagogical under the allegorical sense, laying down three senses only &mdash; the historical, the allegorical, and the <a href="../cathen/15066a.htm">tropological</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The parabolical sense is contained in the literal, for by words things are signified properly and figuratively. Nor is the figure itself, but that which is figured, the literal sense. When <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> speaks of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> arm, the literal sense is not that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has such a member, but only what is signified by this member, namely operative power. Hence it is plain that nothing <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> can ever underlie the literal sense of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>.
