<h1>Question 1. The parts of Penance, in particular, and first of contrition</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5001.htm#article1"> Is Contrition suitably defined?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5001.htm#article2"> Is it an act of virtue?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5001.htm#article3"> Can attrition become contrition?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether contrition is an assumed sorrow for sins, together with the purpose of confessing them and of making satisfaction for them?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is not "an assumed sorrow for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, together with the purpose of confessing them and of making satisfaction for them," as some define it. For, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Civ. Dei xiv, 6), "sorrow is for those things that happen against our will." But this does not apply to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is not sorrow for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is given us by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But what is given is not assumed. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is not an assumed sorrow.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, satisfaction and confession are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the remission of the punishment which was not remitted by <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>. But sometimes the whole punishment is remitted in <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>. Therefore it is not always <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to have the purpose of confessing and of making satisfaction.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> stands the definition.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated in <a href="../bible/sir010.htm#verse15">Sirach 10:15</a>, "<a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is the beginning of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>," because thereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> clings to his own judgment, and strays from the Divine commandments. Consequently that which destroys <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> must needs make <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> give up his own judgment. Now he that persists in his own judgment, is called metaphorically rigid and hard: wherefore anyone is said to be broken when he is torn from his own judgment. But, in material things, whence these expressions are transferred to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, there is a difference between breaking and crushing or <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, as stated in Meteor. iv, in that we speak of breaking when a thing is sundered into large parts, but of crushing or <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> when that which was in itself solid is reduced to minute particles. And since, for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should put aside entirely his attachment to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which implies a certain state of continuity and solidity in his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, therefore it is that the act through which <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is cast aside is called <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> metaphorically.

<p>In this <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> several things are to be observed, viz. the very <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the act, the way of acting, its origin and its effect: in respect of which we find that <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> has been defined in various ways. For, as regards the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the act, we have the definition given above: and since the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is both an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and a part of the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a>, its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is explained in this definition by mentioning its genus, viz. "sorrow," its object by the words "for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>," and the act of choice which is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, by the word "assumed": while, as a part of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, it is made manifest by pointing out its relation to the other parts, in the words "together with the purpose of confessing and of making satisfaction."

<p>There is another definition which defines <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, only as an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; but at the same time including the difference which confines it to a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, viz. penance, for it is thus expressed: "Contrition is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> sorrow for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> punishes in himself that which he grieves to have done," because the addition of the word "punishes" defines the definition to a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Another definition is given by <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> (De Sum. Bono ii, 12) as follows: "Contrition is a tearful sorrow and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> of mind, arising from remembrance of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and fear of the Judgment." Here we have an allusion to the derivation of the word, when it is said that it is "<a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>," because just as <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> makes the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> rigid, so is a man <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a>, when <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> leads him to give up his mind. Also the external manner is indicated by the word "tearful," and the origin of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, by the words, "arising from remembrance of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>," etc. Another definition is taken from the words of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [implicitly on <a href="../bible/psa046.htm">Psalm 46</a>], and indicates the effect of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>. It runs thus: "Contrition is the sorrow which takes away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." Yet another is gathered from the words of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxiii, 11) as follows: "Contrition is <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, crushing <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> between hope and fear." Here the derivation is indicated by saying that <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is "<a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>"; the effect, by the words, "crushing <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>"; and the origin, by the words, "between hope and fear." Indeed, it includes not only the principal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, which is fear, but also its joint <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, which is hope, without which, fear might lead to <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, when committed, were <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, yet when we are <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a> for them, they are no longer <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, so that they occur against our will; not indeed in respect of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> that we had when we consented to them, but in respect of that which we have now, so as to wish they had never been.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Contrition is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone as to the form that quickens it, but as to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the act, it is from the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> and from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who operates in all works both of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and of will.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although the entire punishment may be remitted by <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, yet confession and satisfaction are still <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, both because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot be sure that his <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> was sufficient to take away all, and because confession and satisfaction are a matter of precept: wherefore he becomes a transgressor, who confesses not and makes not satisfaction.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether contrition is an act of virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is not an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are not acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since "they bring us neither praise nor blame" (Ethic. ii, 5). But sorrow is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>. As therefore <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is sorrow, it seems that it is not an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is so called from its being a crushing, so is attrition. Now all agree in saying that attrition is not an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Neither, therefore, is <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Nothing but an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>. But <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is a <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> act. Therefore it is an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Contrition as to the literal signification of the word, does not denote an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but a corporeal passion. But the question in point does not refer to <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> in this sense, but to that which the word is employed to signify by way of metaphor. For just as the inflation of one's own will unto wrong-doing implies, in itself, a generic <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, so the utter undoing and crushing of that same will implies something generically <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, for this is to detest one's own will whereby <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was committed. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, which signifies this, implies rectitude of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; and so it is the act of that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to which it belongs to detest and destroy past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, the act, to wit, of penance, as is evident from what was said above (Sent. iv, D, 14, 1, 1; III, 85, 2,3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Contrition includes a twofold sorrow for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. One is in the sensitive part, and is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>. This does not belong <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> to <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> as an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but is rather its effect. For just as the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of penance inflicts outward punishment on the body, in order to compensate for the offense done to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through the instrumentality of the bodily members, so does it inflict on the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> a punishment, viz. the aforesaid sorrow, because the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> also co-operated in the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. Nevertheless this sorrow may belong to <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> taken as part of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is such that it consists not only of internal but also of external acts and sensible things. The other sorrow is in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and is nothing else save displeasure for some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, for the emotions of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> are named after the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, as stated above (Sent. iii, D, 26, 1, 5; I-II, 22, 3, ad 3). Accordingly, <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> a kind of sorrow, and is an act of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of penance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Attrition denotes approach to perfect <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, wherefore in corporeal matters, things are said to be attrite, when they are worn away to a certain extent, but not altogether crushed to pieces; while they are said to be <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a>, when all the parts are crushed [tritae] minutely. Wherefore, in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> matters, attrition signifies a certain but not a perfect displeasure for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed, whereas <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> denotes perfect displeasure.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether attrition can become contrition?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that attrition can become <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>. For <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> differs from attrition, as living from dead. Now dead <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> becomes living. Therefore attrition can become <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> receives perfection when privation is removed. Now sorrow is to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to form, because <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> quickens sorrow. Therefore the sorrow that was previously lifeless, while guilt remained, receives perfection through being quickened by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: and so the same conclusion follows as above.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Things which are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by principles altogether diverse cannot be changed, one into the other. Now the principle of attrition is servile fear, while filial fear is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>. Therefore attrition cannot become <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There are two opinions on this question: for some say that attrition may become <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, even as lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> becomes living <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But, seemingly, this is impossible; since, although the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> becomes living, yet never does an act of lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> become an act of living <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, because the lifeless act passes away and remains no more, as soon as <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> comes. Now attrition and <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> do not denote a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, but an act only: and those <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of infused <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which regard the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> cannot be lifeless, since they result from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as stated above (Sent. iii, D, 27, 2, 4; I-II, 65, 4). Wherefore until <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> be infused, there is no <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> by which afterwards the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> may be elicited; so that attrition can nowise become attrition: and this is the other opinion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> There is no comparison between <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When the privation is removed from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is quickened if it remains when the perfection comes. But the sorrow which was lifeless, does not remain when <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> comes, wherefore it cannot be quickened.

<p>It may also be replied that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> does not take its origin from the form <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, as an act takes its origin from the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> which quickens it. Wherefore nothing hinders <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> being quickened anew by some form, whereby it was not quickened previously: whereas this cannot be said of an act, even as it is impossible for the identically same thing to arise from a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> wherefrom it did not arise before, since a thing is brought into being but once.
