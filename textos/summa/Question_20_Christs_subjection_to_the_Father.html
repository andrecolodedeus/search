<h1>Question 20. Christ's subjection to the Father</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/4020.htm#article1"> Is Christ subject to the Father?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4020.htm#article2"> Is He subject to Himself?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether we may say that Christ is subject to the Father?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that we may not say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was subject to the Father. For everything subject to the Father is a creature, since, as is said in De Eccles. Dogm. iv, "in the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> there is no dependence or subjection." But we cannot say simply that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is a creature, as was stated above (Question 16, Article 8). Therefore we cannot say simply that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a thing is said to be subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> when it is subservient to His dominion. But we cannot attribute subservience to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of Christ; for <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 21): "We must bear in mind that we may not call it" (i.e. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>) "a servant; for the words 'subservience' and 'domination' are not names of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but of relations, as the words 'paternity' and 'filiation.'" Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse28">1 Corinthians 15:28</a>): "And when all things shall be subdued unto Him, then the Son also Himself shall be subject unto Him that put all things under Him." But, as is written (<a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse8">Hebrews 2:8</a>): "We see not as yet all things subject to Him." Hence He is not yet subject to the Father, Who has subjected all things to Him.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> says (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse28">John 14:28</a>), "The Father is greater than I"; and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. i, 7): "It is not without reason that the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> mentions both, that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is equal to the Father and the Father greater than the Son, for the first is said on account of the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the second on account of the form of a servant, without any confusion." Now the less is subject to the greater. Therefore in the form of a servant <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is subject to the Father.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Whoever has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is competent to have what is proper to that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> from its beginning has a threefold subjection to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The first regards the degree of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, inasmuch as the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> is the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> as is clear from <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. i) while a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> has a participation of the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, being subject, so to say, to the rays of this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Secondly, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as regards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> power, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, even as every creature, is subject to the operation of the Divine ordinance. Thirdly, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is especially subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through its proper act, inasmuch as by its own will it obeys His command. This triple subjection to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> professes of Himself. The first (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse17">Matthew 19:17</a>): "Why askest thou Me concerning <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>? One is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." And on this <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> remarks: "He who had called Him a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> master, and had not confessed Him to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, learns that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, however <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in comparison with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." And hereby He gave us to understand that He Himself, in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, did not attain to the height of Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. And because "in such things as are great, but not in bulk, to be great is the same as to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. vi, 8), for this reason the Father is said to be greater than <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. The second subjection is attributed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, inasmuch as all that befell <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to have happened by Divine appointment; hence <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. iv) that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> "is subject to the ordinance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father." And this is the subjection of subservience, whereby "every creature serves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/jth016.htm#verse17">Judith 16:17</a>), being subject to His ordinance, according to <a href="../bible/wis016.htm#verse24">Wisdom 16:24</a>: "The creature serving Thee the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a>." And in this way the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse7">Philippians 2:7</a>) is said to have taken "the form of a servant." The third subjection He attributes to Himself, saying (<a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse29">John 8:29</a>): "I do always the things that please Him." And this is the subjection to the Father, of obedience unto death. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse8">Philippians 2:8</a>) that he became "obedient" to the Father "unto death."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As we are not to understand that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is a creature simply, but only in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, whether this qualification be added or not, as stated above (Question 16, Article 8), so also we are to understand that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is subject to the Father not simply but in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, even if this qualification be not added; and yet it is better to add this qualification in order to avoid the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, who held the Son to be less than the Father.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The relation of subservience and dominion is based upon action and passion, inasmuch as it belongs to a servant to be moved by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of his master. Now to act is not attributed to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as agent, but to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, since "acts belong to supposita and to singulars," according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. i, 1). Nevertheless action is attributed to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as to that whereby the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> or hypostasis acts. Hence, although the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not properly said to rule or serve, yet every hypostasis or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> may be properly said to be ruling or serving in this or that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. And in this way nothing prevents <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> being subject or servant to the Father in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. i, 8): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> will give the kingdom to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the Father, when He has brought the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, over whom He now reigns by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, to the vision," i.e. to see the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> common to the Father and the Son: and then He will be totally subject to the Father not only in Himself, but also in His members by the full participation of the Godhead. And then all things will be fully subject to Him by the final accomplishment of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> concerning them; although even now all things are subject to Him as regards His power, according to <a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse18">Matthew 28:18</a>: "All power is given to Me in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and in earth."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether Christ is subject to Himself?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not subject to Himself. For Cyril says in a synodal letter which the Council of Ephesus (Part I, ch. xxvi) received: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is neither servant nor master of Himself. It is foolish, or rather impious, to think or say this." And <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says the same (De Fide Orth. iii, 21): "The one Being, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, cannot be the servant or master of Himself." Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is said to be the servant of the Father inasmuch as He is subject to Him. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not subject to Himself.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, servant has reference to master. Now nothing has a relation to itself, hence <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (De Trin. vii) that nothing is like or equal to itself. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> cannot be said to be the servant of Himself, and consequently to be subject to Himself.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "as the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and flesh are one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; so <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> are one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>," as <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> says (Symb. Fid.). Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not said to be subject to himself or servant to himself or greater than himself because his body is subject to his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not said to be subject to Himself because His Manhood is subject to His Godhead.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. i, 7): "Truth shows in this way" (i.e. whereby the Father is greater than <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>) "that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is less than Himself."

<p>Further, as he argues (De Trin. i, 7), the form of a servant was so taken by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> that the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was not lost. But because of the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is common to the Father and the Son, the Father is greater than the Son in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is greater than Himself in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father, according to <a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse17">John 20:17</a>: "I <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascend</a> to My Father and to your Father to My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Now whoever is the servant of the Father is the servant of the Son; otherwise not everything that belongs to the Father would belong to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is His own servant and is subject to Himself.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was said above (1, ad 2), to be master or servant is attributed to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> or hypostasis according to a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence when it is said that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the master or servant of Himself, or that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is the Master of the Man Christ, this may be understood in two ways. First, so that this is understood to be said by reason of another hypostasis or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, as if there was the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> ruling and the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> serving; and this is the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>. Hence in the condemnation of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> it is said in the Council of Ephesus (Part III, ch. i, anath. 6): "If anyone say that the Word begotten of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or Lord of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and does not rather confess the same to be at once <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as the Word made flesh, according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>." And in this sense it is denied by Cyril and <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (Objection 1); and in the same sense must it be denied that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is less than Himself or subject to Himself. Secondly, it may be understood of the diversity of natures in the one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> or hypostasis. And thus we may say that in one of them, in which He agrees with the Father, He presides and rules together with the Father; and in the other <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, in which He agrees with us, He is subject and serves, and in this sense <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says that "the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is less than Himself."

<p>Yet it must be borne in mind that since this name "Christ" is the name of a Person, even as the name "Son," those things can be predicated <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> and absolutely of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> which belong to Him by reason of the Person, Which is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>; and especially those relations which seem more properly to pertain to the Person or the hypostasis. But whatever pertains to Him in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is rather to be attributed to Him with a qualification; so that we say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is simply greatest, Lord, Ruler, whereas to be subject or servant or less is to be attributed to Him with the qualification, in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Cyril and <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> deny that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the head of Himself inasmuch as this implies a plurality of supposita, which is required in order that anyone may be the master of another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Simply speaking it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the master and the servant should be distinct; yet a certain notion of mastership and subservience may be preserved inasmuch as the same one is master of Himself in different respects.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> On account of the divers parts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, one of which is superior and the other inferior, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. v, 11) that there is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> between a man and himself inasmuch as the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> powers obey reason. Hence this way a man may be said to be subject and subservient to Himself as regards His different parts.

<p>To the other arguments, the reply is clear from what has been said. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> asserts that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is less than, or subject to, Himself in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and not by a diversity of supposita.
