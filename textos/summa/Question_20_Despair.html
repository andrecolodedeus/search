<h1>Question 20. Despair</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3020.htm#article1"> Is despair a sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3020.htm#article2"> Can it be without unbelief?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3020.htm#article3"> Is it the greatest of sins?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3020.htm#article4"> Does it arise from sloth?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether despair is a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> includes conversion to a mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, together with aversion from the immutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Lib. Arb. ii, 19). But <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> includes no conversion to a mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore it is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which grows from a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> root, seems to be no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because "a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> tree cannot bring forth <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> fruit" (<a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse18">Matthew 7:18</a>). Now <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> seems to grow from a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> root, viz. fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or from horror at the greatness of one's own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> were a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it would be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> also for the damned to <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>. But this is not imputed to them as their fault but as part of their damnation. Therefore neither is it imputed to wayfarers as their fault, so that it is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> That which leads men to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, seems not only to be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> itself, but a source of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Now such is <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says of certain men (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse19">Ephesians 4:19</a>): "Who, despairing, have given themselves up to lasciviousness, unto the working of all <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> and [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'unto'] <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> is not only a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> but also the origin of other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vi, 2) affirmation and negation in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> correspond to search and avoidance in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; while <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and falsehood in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> correspond to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Consequently every <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> movement which is conformed to a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in itself, while every <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> movement which is conformed to a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in itself and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> opinion of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is that from Him comes <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, and pardon to sinners, according to <a href="../bible/eze018.htm#verse23">Ezekiel 18:23</a>, "I desire not the death of the sinner, but that he should be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>, and live" [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Is it My will that a sinner should die . . . and not that he should be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> and live?' Cf. <a href="../bible/eze033.htm#verse11">Ezekiel 33:11</a>: while it is a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinion that He refuses pardon to the repentant sinner, or that He does not turn sinners to Himself by <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>. Therefore, just as the movement of hope, which is in conformity with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> opinion, is praiseworthy and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, so the contrary movement of <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, which is in conformity with the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinion about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In every mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> there is, in some way, aversion from the immutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and conversion to a mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but not always in the same way. Because, since the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> have <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for their object, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are contrary to them, such as <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> and unbelief, consist principally in aversion from the immutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; but, consequently, they imply conversion to a mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, in so far as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that is a deserter from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, must <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> turn to other things. Other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, however, consist principally in conversion to a mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and, consequently, in aversion from the immutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: because the fornicator intends, not to depart from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but to enjoy carnal pleasure, the result of which is that he departs from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A thing may grow from a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> root in two ways: first, directly and on the part of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> itself; even as an act proceeds from a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>: and in this way no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can grow from a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> root, for in this sense <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> declared (De Lib. Arb. ii, 18,19) that "no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> makes <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> use of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>." Secondly, a thing proceeds from a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> indirectly, or is occasioned by a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and in this way nothing hinders a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> proceeding from a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: thus sometimes men <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> themselves of their <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Ep. ccxi): "Pride lies in wait for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works that they may die." On this way fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or horror of one's own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> may lead to <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, in so far as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> makes <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> use of those <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, by allowing them to be an occasion of <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The damned are outside the pale of hope on account of the impossibility of returning to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>: hence it is not imputed to them that they hope not, but it is a part of their damnation. Even so, it would be no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for a wayfarer to <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> of obtaining that which he had no <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> capacity for obtaining, or which was not due to be obtained by him; for instance, if a physician were to <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> of healing some sick <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, or if anyone were to <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> of ever becoming rich.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether there can be despair without unbelief?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there can be no <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> without unbelief. For the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of hope is derived from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and so long as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> remains the effect is not done away. Therefore a man cannot lose the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of hope, by despairing, unless his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> be removed.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to prefer one's own guilt to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> mercy and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, is to deny the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and mercy, and so savors of unbelief. But whoever despairs, prefers his own guilt to the Divine mercy and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, according to <a href="../bible/gen004.htm#verse13">Genesis 4:13</a>: "My <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> is greater than that I may deserve pardon." Therefore whoever despairs, is an unbeliever.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whoever falls into a condemned <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, is an unbeliever.

<p>But he that despairs seems to fall into a condemned <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, viz. that of the <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatians</a>, who say that there is no pardon for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Therefore it seems that whoever despairs, is an unbeliever.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> If we remove that which follows, that which precedes remains. But hope follows <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as stated above (Question 17, Article 7). Therefore when hope is removed, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> can remain; so that, not everyone who despairs, is an unbeliever.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Unbelief pertains to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, but <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is about universals, while the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is moved in connection with particulars, since the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> movement is from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> towards things, which, in themselves, are particular. Now it may happen that a man, while having a right opinion in the universal, is not rightly disposed as to his <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> movement, his estimate being corrupted in a particular <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, because, in order to pass from the universal opinion to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> for a particular thing, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to have a particular estimate (De Anima iii, 2), just as it is impossible to infer a particular conclusion from an universal proposition, except through the holding of a particular proposition. Hence it is that a man, while having right <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in the universal, fails in an <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> movement, in regard to some particular, his particular estimate being corrupted by a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> or a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, just as the fornicator, by choosing fornication as a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for himself at this particular moment, has a corrupt estimate in a particular <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, although he retains the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> universal estimate according to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, viz. that fornication is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. On the same way, a man while retaining in the universal, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> estimate of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, viz. that there is in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the power of forgiving <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, may suffer a movement of <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, to wit, that for him, being in such a state, there is no hope of pardon, his estimate being corrupted in a particular <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. On this way there can be <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, just as there can be other mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, without <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The effect is done away, not only when the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is removed, but also when the secondary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is removed. Hence the movement of hope can be done away, not only by the removal of the universal estimate of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which is, so to say, the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of hope, but also by the removal of the particular estimate, which is the secondary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as it were.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> If anyone were to judge, in universal, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> mercy is not <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, he would be an unbeliever. But he who despairs judges not thus, but that, for him in that state, on account of some particular disposition, there is no hope of the Divine mercy.

<p>The same answer applies to the Third Objection, since the <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatians</a> denied, in universal, that there is remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether despair is the greatest of sins?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> is not the greatest of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For there can be <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> without unbelief, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). But unbelief is the greatest of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> because it overthrows the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> edifice. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> is not the greatest of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a greater <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is opposed to a greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. viii, 10). But <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is greater than hope, according to <a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse13">1 Corinthians 13:13</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> there is nothing but inordinate aversion from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: whereas in other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> there is not only inordinate aversion from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but also an inordinate conversion. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> is not more but less grave than other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> An incurable <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> seems to be most grievous, according to <a href="../bible/jer030.htm#verse12">Jeremiah 30:12</a>: "Thy bruise is incurable, thy wound is very grievous." Now the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> is incurable, according to <a href="../bible/jer015.htm#verse18">Jeremiah 15:18</a>: "My wound is desperate so as to refuse to be healed." [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Why is my wound,' etc.] Therefore <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> is a most grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are contrary to the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are in themselves more grievous than others: because, since the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> have <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for their object, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are opposed to them imply aversion from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> directly and principally. Now every mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> takes its principal <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> and gravity from the fact of its turning away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for if it were possible to turn to a mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, even inordinately, without turning away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it would not be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Consequently a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which, first and of its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, includes aversion from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is most grievous among mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p>Now unbelief, <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are opposed to the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: and among them, if we compare <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and unbelief to <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, we shall find that, in themselves, that is, in respect of their proper <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, they are more grievous. For unbelief is due to a man not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> own <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; while the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> arises from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will being opposed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> itself; whereas <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> consists in a man ceasing to hope for a share of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Hence it is clear that unbelief and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as He is in Himself, while <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> is against Him, according as His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is partaken of by us. Wherefore strictly speaking it is more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to disbelieve <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, or to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, than not to hope to receive <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> from Him.

<p>If, however, <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> be compared to the other two <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> from our point of view, then <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> is more dangerous, since hope withdraws us from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> and induces us to seek for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, so that when hope is given up, men rush headlong into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and are drawn away from <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works. Wherefore a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/pro024.htm#verse10">Proverbs 24:10</a>, "If thou lose hope being weary in the day of distress, thy strength shall be diminished," says: "Nothing is more hateful than <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that has it loses his constancy both in the every day toils of this life, and, what is worse, in the battle of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>." And <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (De Sum. Bono ii, 14): "To commit a crime is to kill the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but to <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> is to fall into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>."

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether despair arises from sloth?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> does not arise from sloth. Because different <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> do not give rise to one same effect. Now <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> of the future life arises from <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi, 45). Therefore it does not arise from sloth.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> is contrary to <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, so is sloth contrary to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. But <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> arises from hope, according to <a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse12">Romans 12:12</a>, "rejoicing in hope." Therefore sloth arises from <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, and not vice versa.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, contrary effects have contrary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. Now hope, the contrary of which is <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, seems to proceed from the consideration of Divine favors, especially the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiii, 10): "Nothing was so <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to raise our hope, than that we should be shown how much <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> loves us. Now what greater <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> could we have of this than that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> Son should deign to unite Himself to our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>?" Therefore <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> arises rather from the neglect of the above consideration than from sloth.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi, 45) reckons <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> among the effects of sloth.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (17, 1; I-II, 40, 1), the object of hope is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, difficult but possible to obtain by oneself or by another. Consequently the hope of obtaining <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> may be lacking in a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in two ways: first, through his not deeming it an arduous <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; secondly, through his deeming it impossible to obtain either by himself, or by another. Now, the fact that <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods taste <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to us no more, or seem to be goods of no great account, is chiefly due to our affections being infected with the love of bodily pleasures, among which, sexual pleasures hold the first place: for the love of those pleasures leads <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to have a distaste for <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, and not to hope for them as arduous goods. On this way <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p>On the other hand, the fact that a man deems an arduous <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> impossible to obtain, either by himself or by another, is due to his being over downcast, because when this state of mind dominates his affections, it seems to him that he will never be able to rise to any <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. And since sloth is a sadness that casts down the spirit, in this way <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> is born of sloth.

<p>Now this is the proper object of hope--that the thing is possible, because the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and the arduous regard other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> also. Hence <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> is born of sloth in a more special way: though it may arise from <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, for the reason given above.

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Rhet. i, 11), just as hope gives rise to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, so, when a man is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joyful</a> he has greater hope: and, accordingly, those who are sorrowful fall the more easily into <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, according to <a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse7">2 Corinthians 2:7</a>: "Lest . . . such an one be swallowed up by overmuch sorrow." Yet, since the object of hope is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, to which the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> tends <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, and which it shuns, not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> but only on account of some supervening obstacle, it follows that, more directly, hope gives birth to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, while on the contrary <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> is born of sorrow.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This very neglect to consider the Divine favors arises from sloth. For when a man is influenced by a certain passion he considers chiefly the things which pertain to that passion: so that a man who is full of sorrow does not easily think of great and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joyful</a> things, but only of sad things, unless by a great effort he turn his thoughts away from sadness.
