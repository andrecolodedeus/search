<h1>Question 20. God's love</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1020.htm#article1"> Does love exist in God?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1020.htm#article2"> Does He love all things?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1020.htm#article3"> Does He love one thing more than another?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1020.htm#article4"> Does He love more the better things?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether love exists in God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that love does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there are no <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Now love is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>. Therefore love is not in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, love, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, sorrow and the like, are mutually divided against one another. But sorrow and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> are not attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, unless by metaphor. Therefore neither is love attributed to Him.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv): "Love is a uniting and binding force." But this cannot take place in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since He is simple. Therefore love does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is love" (<a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse16">John 4:16</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We must needs assert that in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is love: because love is the first movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and of every <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> faculty. For since the acts of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and of every <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> faculty tend towards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as to their proper objects: and since <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> and especially the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, whereas <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is only the object secondarily and indirectly, as opposed to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; it follows that the acts of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> that regard <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> must <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> be prior to those that regard <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; thus, for instance, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is prior to sorrow, love to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>: because what <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> of itself is always prior to that which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> through another. Again, the more universal is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> prior to what is less so. Hence the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is first directed to universal <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; and in the second place to particular and special <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>. Now there are certain acts of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> that regard <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> under some special <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, as <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and delight regard <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> present and possessed; whereas desire and hope regard <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> not as yet possessed. Love, however, regards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> universally, whether possessed or not. Hence love is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> the first act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; for which reason all the other <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> movements presuppose love, as their root and origin. For nobody desires anything nor rejoices in anything, except as a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that is loved: nor is anything an object of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> except as opposed to the object of love. Similarly, it is clear that sorrow, and other things like to it, must be referred to love as to their first principle. Hence, in whomsoever there is will and <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, there must also be love: since if the first is wanting, all that follows is also wanting. Now it has been shown that <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (19, 1), and hence we must attribute love to Him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The cognitive faculty does not move except through the medium of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a>: and just as in ourselves the universal reason moves through the medium of the particular reason, as stated in De Anima iii, 58,75, so in ourselves the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as it is called, moves through the medium of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Hence, in us the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is the proximate motive-force of our bodies. Some bodily change therefore always accompanies an act of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, and this change affects especially the heart, which, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De part. animal. iii, 4), is the first principle of movement in animals. Therefore acts of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, inasmuch as they have annexed to them some bodily change, are called <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>; whereas acts of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> are not so called. Love, therefore, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and delight are <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>; in so far as they denote acts of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, they are not <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. It is in this latter sense that they are in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> rejoices by an operation that is one and simple," and for the same reason He loves without passion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> there may be distinguished a certain material element--namely, the bodily change--and a certain formal element, which is on the part of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Thus in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii, 15,63,64), the material element is the kindling of the blood about the heart; but the formal, the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> for revenge. Again, as regards the formal element of certain <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> a certain imperfection is implied, as in desire, which is of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> we have not, and in sorrow, which is about the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> we have. This applies also to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, which supposes sorrow. Certain other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, however, as love and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, imply no imperfection. Since therefore none of these can be attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on their material side, as has been said (ad 1); neither can those that even on their formal side imply imperfection be attributed to Him; except metaphorically, and from likeness of effects, as already show (3, 2, ad 2; 19, 11). Whereas, those that do not imply imperfection, such as love and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, can be properly predicated of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, though without attributing passion to Him, as said before (19, 11).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> An act of love always tends towards two things; to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that one wills, and to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> for whom one wills it: since to love a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is to wish that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Hence, inasmuch as we love ourselves, we wish ourselves <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and, so far as possible, union with that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. So love is called the unitive force, even in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet without implying composition; for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that He wills for Himself, is no other than Himself, Who is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, as above shown (6, 1, 3). And by the fact that anyone loves another, he wills <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to that other. Thus he puts the other, as it were, in the place of himself; and regards the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> done to him as done to himself. So far love is a binding force, since it aggregates another to ourselves, and refers his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to our own. And then again the divine love is a binding force, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to others; yet it implies no composition in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether God loves all things?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not love all things. For according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. iv, 1), love places the lover outside himself, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> him to pass, as it were, into the object of his love. But it is not admissible to say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is placed outside of Himself, and passes into other things. Therefore it is inadmissible to say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> loves things other than Himself.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. But things apart from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are not from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>; except in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not love anything, except as it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in Himself. But as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in Him, it is no other than Himself. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not love things other than Himself.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, love is twofold--the love, namely, of desire, and the love of friendship. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not love irrational creatures with the love of desire, since He needs no creature outside Himself. Nor with the love of friendship; since there can be no friendship with irrational creatures, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> shows (Ethic. viii, 2). Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not love all things.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/psa005.htm#verse7">Psalm 5:7</a>): "Thou hatest all the workers of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>." Now nothing is at the same time <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> and loved. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not love all things.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/wis011.htm#verse25">Wisdom 11:25</a>): "Thou lovest all things that are, and hatest none of the things which Thou hast made."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> loves all <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> things. For all <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> things, in so far as they <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of a thing is itself a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and likewise, whatever perfection it possesses. Now it has been shown above (Question 19, Article 4) that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all things. It must needs be, therefore, that a thing has <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, or any kind of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, only inasmuch as it is willed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. To every <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> thing, then, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Hence, since to love anything is nothing else than to will <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to that thing, it is manifest that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> loves everything that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>. Yet not as we love. Because since our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of things, but is moved by it as by its object, our love, whereby we will <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to anything, is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>; but conversely its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, whether real or <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a>, calls forth our love, by which we will that it should preserve the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> it has, and receive besides the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> it has not, and to this end we direct our actions: whereas the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> infuses and creates <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A lover is placed outside himself, and made to pass into the object of his love, inasmuch as he wills <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the beloved; and works for that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by his <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> even as he works for his own. Hence <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv, 1): "On behalf of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> we must make bold to say even this, that He Himself, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all things, by His abounding love and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, is placed outside Himself by His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> for all <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> things."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although creatures have not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, except in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet because they have been in Him from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> them <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> in their proper <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>; and for that reason has loved them, even as we, by the images of things within us, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> things <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in themselves.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Friendship cannot <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> except towards rational creatures, who are capable of returning love, and communicating one with another in the various works of life, and who may fare well or ill, according to the changes of fortune and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>; even as to them is benevolence properly speaking exercised. But irrational creatures cannot attain to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor to any share in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and beatific life that He lives. Strictly speaking, therefore, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not love irrational creatures with the love of friendship; but as it were with the love of desire, in so far as He orders them to rational creatures, and even to Himself. Yet this is not because He stands in need of them; but only on account of His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, and of the services they render to us. For we can desire a thing for others as well as for ourselves.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Nothing prevents one and the same thing being loved under one aspect, while it is <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> under another. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> loves sinners in so far as they are <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>; for they have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> and have it from Him. In so far as they are sinners, they have not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> at all, but fall short of it; and this in them is not from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence under this aspect, they are <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> by Him.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether God loves all things equally?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> loves all things equally. For it is said: "He hath equally care of all" (<a href="../bible/wis006.htm#verse8">Wisdom 6:8</a>). But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> over things comes from the love wherewith He loves them. Therefore He loves all things equally.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> does not admit of degree; neither therefore does His love. He does not therefore love some things more than others.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> love extends to <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things, so do His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and will extend. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not said to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> some things more than others; nor will one thing more than another. Neither therefore does He love some things more than others.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. in Joan. cx): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> loves all things that He has made, and amongst them rational creatures more, and of these especially those who are members of His only-begotten Son Himself."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since to love a thing is to will it <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, in a twofold way anything may be loved more, or less. In one way on the part of the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> itself, which is more or less intense. In this way <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not love some things more than others, because He loves all things by an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> that is one, simple, and always the same. In another way on the part of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> itself that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> wills for the beloved. In this way we are said to love that one more than another, for whom we will a greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, though our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not more intense. In this way we must needs say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> loves some things more than others. For since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> love is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> in things, as has been said (2), no one thing would be better than another, if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> did not will greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for one than for another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said to have equally care of all, not because by His care He deals out equal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to all, but because He administers all things with a like wisdom and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument is based on the intensity of love on the part of the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which is the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills for His creatures, is not the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Therefore there is no reason why it may not vary in degree.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> To understand and to will denote the act alone, and do not include in their meaning objects from the diversity of which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may be said to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> or will more or less, as has been said with respect to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> love.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether God always loves more the better things?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not always love more the better things. For it is manifest that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is better than the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, being <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> loved the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> more than He loved <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; for it is said: "He spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all" (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse32">Romans 8:32</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not always love more the better things.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is better than a man. Hence it is said of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: "Thou hast made him a little less than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>" (<a href="../bible/psa008.htm#verse6">Psalm 8:6</a>). But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> loved men more than He loved the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, for it is said: "Nowhere doth He take hold of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but of the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> He taketh hold" (<a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse16">Hebrews 2:16</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not always love more the better things.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> was better than <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a>, since he loved <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> more. Hence the Lord, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> this to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, asked <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, saying: "Simon, son of John, lovest thou Me more than these?" Yet <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> loved <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a> more than He loved <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>. For as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says, commenting on the words, "Simon, son of John, lovest thou Me?": "By this very mark is <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a> distinguished from the other <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, not that He loved him only, but that He loved him more than the rest." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not always love more the better things.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the innocent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is better than the repentant, since repentance is, as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (Cap. 3 in Isa.), "a second plank after shipwreck." But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> loves the penitent more than the innocent; since He rejoices over him the more. For it is said: "I say to you that there shall be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> upon the one sinner that doth penance, more than upon ninety-nine just who need not penance" (<a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse7">Luke 15:7</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not always love more the better things.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who is foreknown is better than the predestined sinner. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> loves more the predestined sinner, since He wills for him a greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not always love more the better things.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Everything loves what is like it, as appears from (<a href="../bible/sir013.htm#verse19">Sirach 13:19</a>): "Every beast loveth its like." Now the better a thing is, the more like is it to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore the better things are more loved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It must needs be, according to what has been said before, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> loves more the better things . For it has been shown (2, 3), that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> one thing more than another is nothing else than His willing for that thing a greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> in things; and the reason why some things are better than others, is that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills for them a greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Hence it follows that He loves more the better things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> loves <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> not only more than He loves the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, but more than He loves the entire <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>: because He willed for Him the greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in giving Him "a name that is above all names," in so far as He was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Nor did anything of His excellence diminish when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> delivered Him up to death for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>; rather did He become thereby a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> conqueror: "The government was placed upon His shoulder," according to <a href="../bible/isa009.htm#verse6">Isaiah 9:6</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> loves the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> assumed by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> more than He loves all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; for that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is better, especially on the ground of the union with the Godhead. But speaking of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in general, and comparing it with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a>, the two are found equal, in the order of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: since according to <a href="../bible/rev021.htm#verse17">Revelation 21:17</a>, the measure of a man and of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is the same. Yet so that, in this respect, some <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are found nobler than some men, and some men nobler than some <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. But as to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is better than a man. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> therefore did not assume <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> because He loved <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, absolutely speaking, more; but because the needs of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> were greater; just as the master of a house may give some costly delicacy to a sick servant, that he does not give to his own son in sound health.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> and <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a> has been solved in various ways. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> interprets it mystically, and says that the active life, signified by <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more than the contemplative signified by <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a>, because the former is more conscious of the miseries of this present life, and therefore the more ardently desires to be freed from them, and depart to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he says, loves more the contemplative life, since He preserves it longer. For it does not end, as the active life does, with the life of the body.

<p>Some say that <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> loved <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> more in His members, and therefore was loved more by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> also, for which reason He gave him the care of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; but that <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a> loved <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> more in Himself, and so was loved more by Him; on which account <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> commended His mother to his care. Others say that it is uncertain which of them loved <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> more with the love of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and uncertain also which of them <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> loved more and ordained to a greater degree of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>. <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> is said to have loved more, in regard to a certain promptness and fervor; but <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a> to have been more loved, with respect to certain marks of familiarity which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> showed to him rather than to others, on account of his youth and purity. While others say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> loved <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> more, from his more excellent <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; but <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a> more, from his <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Hence, absolutely speaking, <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> was the better and more beloved; but, in a certain sense, <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a> was the better, and was loved the more. However, it may seem presumptuous to pass judgment on these matters; since "the Lord" and no other "is the weigher of spirits" (<a href="../bible/pro016.htm#verse2">Proverbs 16:2</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The penitent and the innocent are related as exceeding and exceeded. For whether innocent or penitent, those are the better and better loved who have most <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Other things being equal, innocence is the nobler thing and the more beloved. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said to rejoice more over the penitent than over the innocent, because often penitents rise from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> more cautious, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, and fervent. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> commenting on these words (Hom. 34 in Ev.) says that, "In battle the general loves the soldier who after flight returns and bravely pursues the enemy, more than him who has never fled, but has never done a brave <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>."

<p>Or it may be answered that <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, equal in themselves, are more as conferred on the penitent, who deserved punishment, than as conferred on the innocent, to whom no punishment was due; just as a hundred pounds [marcoe] are a greater <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> to a poor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> than to a king.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> in things, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of one who is loved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is to be reckoned according to the time when some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is to be given to him by divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. According therefore to the time, when there is to be given by the divine will to the predestined sinner a greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, the sinner is better; although according to some other time he is the worse; because even according to some time he is neither <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> nor bad.
