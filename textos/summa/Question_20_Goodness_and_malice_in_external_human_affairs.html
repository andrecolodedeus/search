<h1>Question 20. Goodness and malice in external human affairs</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2020.htm#article1"> Is goodness and malice first in the act of the will, or in the external action?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2020.htm#article2"> Does the whole goodness or malice of the external action depend on the goodness of the will?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2020.htm#article3"> Are the goodness and malice of the interior act the same as those of the external action?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2020.htm#article4"> Does the external action add any goodness or malice to that of the interior act?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2020.htm#article5"> Do the consequences of an external action increase its goodness or malice?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2020.htm#article6"> Can one and the same external action be both good and evil?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether goodness or malice is first in the action of the will, or in the external action?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> are in the external action prior to being in the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> derives <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> from its object, as stated above (19, 1,2). But the external action is the object of the interior act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: for a man is said to will to commit a <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>, or to will to give an <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> are in the external action, prior to being in the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> belongs first to the end: since what is directed to the end receives the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> from its relation to the end. Now whereas the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> cannot be an end, as stated above (1, 1, ad 2), the act of another power can be an end. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is in the act of some other power prior to being in the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> stands in a formal relation to the external action, as stated above (Question 18, Article 6). But that which is formal is subsequent; since form is something added to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> are in the external action, prior to being in the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Retract. i, 9) that "it is by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> that we <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and that we behave aright." Therefore moral <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> are first in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> External actions may be said to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or bad in two ways. First, in regard to their genus, and the circumstances connected with them: thus the giving of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, if the required <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> be observed, is said to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Secondly, a thing is said to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, from its relation to the end: thus the giving of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> for vainglory is said to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Now, since the end is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will's</a> proper object, it is evident that this aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, which the external action derives from its relation to the end, is to be found first of all in the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, whence it passes to the external action. On the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> which the external action has of itself, on account of its being about due <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and its being attended by due circumstances, is not derived from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, but rather from the reason. Consequently, if we consider the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the external action, in so far as it comes from <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason's</a> ordination and apprehension, it is prior to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: but if we consider it in so far as it is in the execution of the action done, it is subsequent to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which is its principle.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The exterior action is the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, inasmuch as it is proposed to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> by the reason, as <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> apprehended and ordained by the reason: and thus it is prior to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. But inasmuch as it is found in the execution of the action, it is an effect of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and is subsequent to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The end precedes in the order of <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, but follows in the order of execution.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A form as received into <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, is subsequent to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in the order of generation, although it precedes it in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: but inasmuch as it is in the active <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, it precedes in every way. Now the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is compared to the exterior action, as its efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the active <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, is the form of the exterior action.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the whole goodness and malice of the external action depends on the goodness of the will?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the whole <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of the external action depend on the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse18">Matthew 7:18</a>): "A <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> tree cannot bring forth <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> fruit, neither can an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> tree bring forth <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> fruit." But, according to the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a>, the tree signifies the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and fruit signifies works. Therefore, it is impossible for the interior act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and the external action <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, or vice versa.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Retract. i, 9) that there is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> without the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. If therefore there is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, there will be none in the external action. And so the whole <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of the external action depends on the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of which we are speaking now are differences of the moral act. Now differences make an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> division in a genus, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. vii, 12). Since therefore an act is moral from being <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, it seems that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> in an act are derived from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> alone.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Mendac. vii), that "there are some actions which neither a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> end nor a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will can make <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), we may consider a twofold <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> in the external action: one in respect of due <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and circumstances; the other in respect of the order to the end. And that which is in respect of the order to the end, depends entirely on the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: while that which is in respect of due <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> or circumstances, depends on the reason: and on this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> depends the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, in so far as the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> tends towards it.

<p>Now it must be observed, as was noted above (19, 6, ad 1), that for a thing to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, one single defect suffices, whereas, for it to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> simply, it is not enough for it to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in one point only, it must be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in every respect. If therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, both from its proper object and from its end, if follows that the external action is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But if the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> from its <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the end, this is not enough to make the external action <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: and if the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> either by reason of its <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the end, or by reason of the act willed, it follows that the external action is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> If the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> tree be taken to signify the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will, it must be in so far as the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> derives <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> from the act willed and from the end intended.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by his will, not only when he wills an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> end; but also when he wills an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Voluntariness applies not only to the interior act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, but also to external actions, inasmuch as they proceed from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and the reason. Consequently the difference of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is applicable to both the interior and external act.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the goodness and malice of the external action are the same as those of the interior act?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of the interior act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> are not the same as those of the external action. For the principle of the interior act is the interior apprehensive or <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; whereas the principle of the external action is the power that accomplishes the movement. Now where the principles of action are different, the actions themselves are different. Moreover, it is the action which is the subject of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>: and the same <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> cannot be in different subjects. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the interior act cannot be the same as that of the external action.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "A <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> makes that, which has it, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and renders its action <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> also" (Ethic. ii, 6). But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in the commanding power is distinct from the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in the power commanded, as is declared in Ethic. i, 13. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the interior act, which belongs to the commanding power, is distinct from the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the external action, which belongs to the power commanded.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the same thing cannot be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and effect; since nothing is its own <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the interior act is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the external action, or vice versa, as stated above (1,2). Therefore it is not the same <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> in each.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It was shown above (Question 18, Article 6) that the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the form, as it were, of the external action. Now that which results from the material and formal element is one thing. Therefore there is but one <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the internal and external act.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 17, Article 4), the interior act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and the external action, considered morally, are one act. Now it happens sometimes that one and the same <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> act has several aspects of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, and sometimes that it has but one. Hence we must say that sometimes the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of the interior act is the same as that of the external action, and sometimes not. For as we have already said (1,2), these two goodnesses or malices, of the internal and external acts, are ordained to one another. Now it may happen, in things that are subordinate to something else, that a thing is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> merely from being subordinate; thus a bitter draught is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> merely because it procures health. Wherefore there are not two goodnesses, one the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of health, and the other the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the draught; but one and the same. On the other hand it happens sometimes that that which is subordinate to something else, has some aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> in itself, besides the fact of its being subordinate to some other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: thus a palatable medicine can be considered in the light of a pleasurable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, besides being conducive to health.

<p>We must therefore say that when the external action derives <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> from its relation to the end only, then there is but one and the same <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> which of itself regards the end, and of the external action, which regards the end through the medium of the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. But when the external action has <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of itself, i.e. in regard to its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and circumstances, then the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the external action is distinct from the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in regarding the end; yet so that the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the end passes into the external action, and the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and circumstances passes into the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as stated above (1,2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument proves that the internal and external actions are different in the physical order: yet distinct as they are in that respect, they combine to form one thing in the moral order, as stated above (Question 17, Article 4).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated in Ethic. vi, 12, a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is ordained to the act of that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which act is the end, as it were, of that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; whereas <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, which is in the reason, is ordained to things directed to the end. For this reason various <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. But right reason in regard to the very end of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> has no other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> than the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, in so far as the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the reason is participated in each <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> When a thing is derived by one thing from another, as from a univocal efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, then it is not the same in both: thus when a hot thing heats, the heat of the heater is distinct from the heat of the thing heated, although it be the same specifically. But when a thing is derived from one thing from another, according to analogy or proportion, then it is one and the same in both: thus the healthiness which is in medicine or urine is derived from the healthiness of the animal's body; nor is health as applied to urine and medicine, distinct from health as applied to the body of an animal, of which health medicine is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and urine the sign. It is in this way that the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the external action is derived from the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and vice versa; viz. according to the order of one to the other.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the external action adds any goodness or malice to that of the interior act?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the external action does not add any <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> to that of the interior action. For <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. xix in Matt.): "It is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> that is rewarded for doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, or punished for doing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." Now works are the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> seeks for works not on His own account, in order to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to judge; but for the sake of others, that all may understand how just He is. But <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is to be estimated according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> judgment rather than according to the judgment of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore the external action adds no <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> to that of the interior act.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of the interior and external acts are one and the same, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). But increase is the addition of one thing to another. Therefore the external action does not add to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of the interior act.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the entire <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things does not add to the Divine Goodness, because it is entirely derived therefrom. But sometimes the entire <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the external action is derived from the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the interior act, and sometimes conversely, as stated above (1,2). Therefore neither of them adds to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of the other.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Every agent intends to attain <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and avoid <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. If therefore by the external action no further <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> be added, it is to no purpose that he who has a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will, does a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> or refrains from an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>. Which is unreasonable.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> If we speak of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> which the external action derives from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> tending to the end, then the external action adds nothing to this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, unless it happens that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in itself is made better in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, or worse in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things. This, seemingly, may happen in three ways. First in point of number; if, for instance, a man wishes to do something with a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> end in view, and does not do it then, but afterwards wills and does it, the act of his <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is doubled and a double <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, or a double <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is the result. Secondly, in point of extension: when, for instance, a man wishes to do something for a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> end, and is hindered by some obstacle, whereas another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> perseveres in the movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> until he accomplish it in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>; it is evident that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the latter is more lasting in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and in this respect, is better or worse. Thirdly, in point of intensity: for these are certain external actions, which, in so far as they are pleasurable, or painful, are such as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> to make the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> more intense or more remiss; and it is evident that the more intensely the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> tends to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, the better or worse it is.

<p>On the other hand, if we speak of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> which the external action derives from its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and due circumstances, thus it stands in relation to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as its term and end. And in this way it adds to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; because every inclination or movement is perfected by attaining its end or reaching its term. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not perfect, unless it be such that, given the opportunity, it realizes the operation. But if this <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> impossible, as long as the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is perfect, so as to realize the operation if it could; the lack of perfection derived from the external action, is simply involuntary. Now just as the involuntary deserves neither punishment nor reward in the accomplishment of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, so neither does it lessen reward or punishment, if a man through simple involuntariness fail to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> is speaking of the case where a man's <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is complete, and does not refrain from the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> save through the impossibility of achievement.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument applies to that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> which the external action derives from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as tending to the end. But the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> which the external action takes from its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and circumstances, is distinct from that which it derives from the end; but it is not distinct from that which it has from the very act willed, to which it stands in the relation of measure and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as stated above (1,2).

<p>From this the reply to the Third Objection is evident.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the consequences of the external action increase its goodness or malice?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the consequences of the external action increase its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>. For the effect pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> virtually in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But the consequences result from the action as an effect from its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Therefore they pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> virtually in actions. Now a thing is judged to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or bad according to its <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> "makes that which has it to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" (Ethic. ii, 6). Therefore the consequences increase the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of an action.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> actions of his hearers are consequences resulting from the words of a preacher. But such goods as these redound to the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of the preacher, as is evident from <a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse1">Philippians 4:1</a>: "My dearly beloved brethren, my <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and my crown." Therefore the consequences of an action increase its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, punishment is not increased, unless the fault increases: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/deu025.htm#verse2">Deuteronomy 25:2</a>): "According to the measure of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> shall the measure also of the stripes be." But the punishment is increased on account of the consequences; for it is written (<a href="../bible/exo021.htm#verse29">Exodus 21:29</a>): "But if the ox was wont to push with his horn yesterday and the day before, and they warned his master, and he did not shut him up, and he shall kill a man or a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, then the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death." But he would not have been put to death, if the ox, although he had not been shut up, had not killed a man. Therefore the consequences increase the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of an action.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, if a man do something which may <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> death, by striking, or by sentencing, and if death does not ensue, he does not contract <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a>: but he would if death were to ensue. Therefore the consequence of an action increase its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The consequences do not make an action that was <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; nor one that was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For instance, if a man give an <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> to a poor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who makes bad use of the <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> by committing a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, this does not undo the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> done by the giver; and, in like manner, if a man bear patiently a wrong done to him, the wrongdoer is not thereby excused. Therefore the consequences of an action doe not increase its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The consequences of an action are either foreseen or not. If they are foreseen, it is evident that they increase the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>. For when a man foresees that many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> may follow from his action, and yet does not therefore desist therefrom, this shows his will to be all the more inordinate.

<p>But if the consequences are not foreseen, we must make a distinction. Because if they follow from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the action and in the majority of cases, in this respect, the consequences increase the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of that action: for it is evident that an action is specifically better, if better results can follow from it; and specifically worse, if it is of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to produce worse results. On the other hand, if the consequences follow by <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> and seldom, then they do not increase the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of the action: because we do not judge of a thing according to that which belongs to it by <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, but only according to that which belongs to it of itself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is measured by the effect that flows from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, not by that which results by <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> actions done by the hearers, result from the preacher's words, as an effect that flows from their very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence they redound to the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of the preacher: especially when such is his <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The consequences for which that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is ordered to be punished, both follow from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and are supposed to be foreseen. For this reason they are reckoned as punishable.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> This argument would <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> if <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a> were the result of the fault. But it is not the result of the fault, but of the fact, and of the obstacle to the reception of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether one and the same external action can be both good and evil?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one and the same external action can be both <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For "movement, if continuous, is one and the same" (Phys. v, 4). But one continuous movement can be both <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and bad: for instance, a man may go to church continuously, intending at first vainglory, and afterwards the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore one and the same action can be both <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and bad.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Phys. iii, 3), action and passion are one act. But the passion may be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> was; and the action <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as that of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>. Therefore one and the same act can be both <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, since a servant is an instrument, as it were, of his master, the servant's action is his master's, just as the action of a tool is the workman's action. But it may happen that the servant's action result from his master's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will, and is therefore <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: and from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will of the servant, and is therefore <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore the same action can be both <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The same thing cannot be the subject of contraries. But <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> are contraries. Therefore the same action cannot be both <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The same thing cannot be the subject of contraries. But <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> are contraries. Therefore the same action cannot be both <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Nothing hinders a thing from being one, in so far as it is in one genus, and manifold, in so far as it is referred to another genus. Thus a continuous surface is one, considered as in the genus of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>; and yet it is manifold, considered as to the genus of color, if it be partly white, and partly black. And accordingly, nothing hinders an action from being one, considered in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order; whereas it is not one, considered in the moral order; and vice versa, as we have stated above (3, ad 1; 18, 7, ad 1). For continuous walking is one action, considered in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order: but it may resolve itself into many actions, considered in the moral order, if a change take place in the walker's will, for the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the principle of moral actions. If therefore we consider one action in the moral order, it is impossible for it to be morally both <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Whereas if it be one as to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and not moral unity, it can be both <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This continual movement which proceeds from various intentions, although it is one in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order, is not one in the point of moral unity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Action and passion belong to the moral order, in so far as they are <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. And therefore in so far as they are <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> in respect of wills that differ, they are two distinct things, and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> can be in one of them while <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is in the other.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The action of the servant, in so far as it proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the servant, is not the master's action: but only in so far as it proceeds from the master's command. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will of the servant does not make the action <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in this respect.
