<h1>Question 20. Those on whom the power of the keys Can be exercised</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5020.htm#article1"> Can a priest use the key, which he has, on any man?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5020.htm#article2"> Can a priest always absolve his subject?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5020.htm#article3"> Can anyone use the keys on his superior?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether a priest can use the key which he has, on any man?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> can use the key which he has, on any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> was bestowed on <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> by Divine authority in the words: "Receive ye the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> you shall forgive, they are forgiven them" (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse22">John 20:22-23</a>). But this was said without any restriction. Therefore he that has the key, can use it on any without restriction.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a material key that opens one lock, opens all locks of the same pattern. Now every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is the same kind of obstacle against entering into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Therefore if a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> can, by means of the key which he has, <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, he can do the same for all others.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> is more perfect than that of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> could use the power which he had of discerning between different kinds of <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>, with regard to all indiscriminately. Much more therefore can the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the Gospel use his power with regard to all.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written in the Appendix of Gratian: "It is not lawful for every <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to loose or bind another <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>'s parishioner." Therefore a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> everybody.

<p>Further, judgment in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> matters should be better regulated than in temporal matters. But in temporal matters a judge cannot judge everybody. Therefore, since the use of the keys is a kind of judgment, it is not within the competency of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to use his key with regard to everyone.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> That which has to do with singular matters is not equally in the power of all. Thus, even as besides the general principles of medicine, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to have physicians, who adapt those general principles to <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> patients or diseases, according to their various requirements, so in every kingdom, besides that one who proclaims the universal precepts of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, there is need for others to adapt those precepts to <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> cases, according as each case demands. For this reason, in the heavenly <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> also, under the Powers who rule indiscriminately, a place is given to the Principalities, who are appointed to <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> kingdoms, and to the Angels who are given charge over <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> men, as we have explained above (I, 113, 1,2). Consequently there should be a like order of authority in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Militant, so that an indiscriminate authority over all should be vested in one <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, and that there should be others under him, having distinct authority over various people. Now the use of the keys implies a certain power to exercise authority, whereby the one on whom the keys are used, becomes the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of that act. Therefore he that has power over all indiscriminately, can use the keys on all, whereas those who have received authority over distinct <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, cannot use the keys on everyone, but only on those over whom they are appointed, except in cases of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> should be refused to no one.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A twofold power is required in order to <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, namely, power of order and power of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. The former power is equally in all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, but not the latter. And therefore, when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse23">John 20:23</a>) gave all the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> in general, the power of forgiving <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, this is to be understood of the power which results from receiving orders, wherefore these words are addressed to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> when they are ordained. But to Peter in particular He gave the power of forgiving <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse19">Matthew 16:19</a>), that we may understand that he has the power of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> before the others. But the power of orders, considered in itself, extends to all who can be <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a>: wherefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said indeterminately, "Whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> you shall forgive, they are forgiven them," on the understanding that this power should be used in dependence on the power given to Peter, according to His appointment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A material key can open only its own lock. nor can any active force act save on its own <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Now a man becomes the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the power of order by <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>: and consequently no one can use the key in respect of another over whom he has not <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> were one people, and had but one temple, so that there was no need for a distinction in <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, as there is now in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which comprises various peoples and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether a priest can always absolve his subject?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> cannot always <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> his subject. For, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De vera et <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> Poenitentia [Work of an unknown author]), "no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should exercise the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> office, unless he be free from those things which he condemns in others." But a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> might happen to share in a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed by his subject, e.g. by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who is his subject. Therefore it seems that he cannot always use the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> on his subjects.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, by the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> a man is healed of all his shortcomings. Now it happens sometimes that a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has attached to it a defect of <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a> or a sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, from which a simple <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a>. Therefore it seems that he cannot use the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> on such as are shackled by these things in the above manner.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the judgment and power of our <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> was foreshadowed by the judgment of the ancient <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. Now according to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, the lesser judges were not competent to decide all cases, and had recourse to the higher judges, according to <a href="../bible/exo024.htm#verse14">Exodus 24:14</a>: "If any question shall arise" among you, "you shall refer it to them." It seems, therefore, that a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> his subject from graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but should refer him to his superior.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Whoever has charge of the principal has charge of the accessory. Now <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are charged with the dispensation of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> to their subjects, to which sacrament the <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is subordinate [Cf. 17, 2, ad 1]. Therefore, as far as the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> is concerned, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> can <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> his subject from any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> whatever.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, however small, removes all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> dispenses <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> whereby <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is given. Therefore, as far as the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> is concerned, he can <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> from all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The power of order, considered in itself, extends to the remission of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But since, as stated above, the use of this power requires <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> which inferiors derive from their superiors, it follows that the superior can reserve certain matters to himself, the judgment of which he does not commit to his inferior; otherwise any simple <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who has <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> can <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> from any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now there are five cases in which a simple <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> must refer his penitent to his superior. The first is when a public penance has to be imposed, because in that case the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is the proper minister of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. The second is the case of those who are <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> when the inferior <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> a penitent through the latter being <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by his superior. The third case is when he finds that an <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a> has been contracted, for the dispensation of which he has to have recourse to his superior. The fourth is the case of arson. The fifth is when it is the custom in a diocese for the more heinous crimes to be reserved to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, in order to inspire fear, because custom in these cases either gives the power or takes it away.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In this case the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> should not hear the confession of his accomplice, with regard to that particular <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but must refer her to another: nor should she confess to him but should ask permission to go to another, or should have recourse to his superior if he refused, both on account of the danger, and for the sake of less shame. If, however, he were to <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> her it would be valid*: because when <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says that they should not be guilty of the same <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he is speaking of what is congruous, not of what is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. [Benedict XIV declared the <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> of an accomplice "in materia turpi" to be invalid.]

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Penance delivers <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from all defects of guilt, but not from all defects of punishment, since even after doing penance for <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, a man remains <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregular</a>. Hence a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> can <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> from a crime, but for the remission of the punishment he must refer the penitent to the superior, except in the case of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> from which should precede <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for as long as a man is <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, he cannot receive any sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This objection considers those cases in which superiors reserve the power of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> to themselves.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether a man can use the keys with regard to his superior?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a man cannot use the keys in respect of a superior. For every sacramental act requires its proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Now the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> for the use of the keys, is a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who is subject, as stated above (Question 19, Article 6). Therefore a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> cannot use the keys in respect of one who is not his subject.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Militant is an image of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Triumphant. Now in the heavenly Church an inferior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> never cleanses, enlightens or perfects a higher <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. Therefore neither can an inferior <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> exercise on a superior a <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchical</a> action such as <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the judgment of Penance should be better regulated than the judgment of an external court. Now in the external court an inferior cannot <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> or <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> his superior. Therefore, seemingly, neither can he do so in the penitential court.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The higher prelate is also "compassed with infirmity," and may happen to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> is the remedy for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore, since he cannot use the key on himself, for he cannot be both judge and accused at the same time, it seems that an inferior can use the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> on him.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> which is given through the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a>, is ordained to the reception of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>. But an inferior can give Communion to his superior, if the latter asks him to. Therefore he can use the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> on him if he submit to him.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a>, considered in itself, is applicable to all, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>): and that a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is unable to use the keys on some particular <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is due to his power being limited to certain <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>. Therefore he who limited his power can extend it to whom he wills, so that he can give him power over himself, although he cannot use the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> on himself, because this power requires to be exercised on a subject, and therefore on someone else, for no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can be subject to himself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> whom a simple <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> absolves is his superior absolutely speaking, yet he is beneath him in so far as he submits himself as a sinner to him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> there can be no defect by reason of which the higher <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can submit to the lower, such as there can happen to be among men; and so there is no comparison.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> External judgment is according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, whereas the judgment of confession is according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in Whose sight a man is lessened by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, which is not the case in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> prelacy. Therefore just as in external judgment no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can pass sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> on himself, so neither can he empower another to <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> him. On the other hand, in the tribunal of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> he can give another the power to <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> him, though he cannot use that power himself.

<p>It may also be replied that <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> in the tribunal of the confessional belongs principally to the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> and consequently to the power of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, whereas <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> regards <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> exclusively. And, as to the power of orders, all are equal, but not as to <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Wherefore there is no comparison.
