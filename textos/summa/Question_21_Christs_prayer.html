<h1>Question 21. Christ's prayer</h1>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether it is becoming of Christ to pray?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem unbecoming that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. For, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 24), "<a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is the asking for becoming things from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." But since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> could do all things, it does not seem becoming to Him to ask anything from anyone. Therefore it does not seem fitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, we need not ask in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for what we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> for certain will happen; thus, we do not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that the sun may rise tomorrow. Nor is it fitting that anyone should ask in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> will not happen. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in all things <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knew</a> what would happen. Therefore it was not fitting that He should ask anything in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 24) that "<a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is the raising up of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Now Christ's mind needed no uplifting to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since His mind was always united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not only by the union of the hypostasis, but by the fruition of beatitude. Therefore it was not fitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse12">Luke 6:12</a>): "And it came to pass in those days, that He went out into a mountain, and He passed the whole night in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was said in the II-II, 83, 1,2, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is the unfolding of our will to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that He may fulfill it. If, therefore, there had been but one will in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, viz. the Divine, it would nowise belong to Him to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, since the Divine will of itself is effective of whatever He wishes by it, according to <a href="../bible/psa134.htm#verse6">Psalm 134:6</a>: "Whatsoever the Lord pleased, He hath done." But because the Divine and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> wills are distinct in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will of itself is not efficacious enough to do what it wishes, except by Divine power, hence to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and as having a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and not as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was able to carry out all He wished, since as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> He was not <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>, as stated above (13, 1). Nevertheless being both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, He wished to offer <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to the Father, not as though He were incompetent, but for our instruction. First, that He might show Himself to be from the Father; hence He says (<a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse42">John 11:42</a>): "Because of the people who stand about I have said it" (i.e. the words of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>) "that they may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that Thou hast sent Me." Hence <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (De Trin. x): "He did not need <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. It was for us He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, lest the Son should be unknown." Secondly, to give us an example of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; hence <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (on <a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse12">Luke 6:12</a>): "Be not deceived, nor think that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> as a weakling, in order to beseech what He cannot effect. For the Author of power, the Master of obedience persuades us to the precepts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> by His example." Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. civ in Joan.): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> in the form of a servant could have <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> in silence, if need be, but He wished to show Himself a suppliant of the Father, in such sort as to bear in mind that He was our Teacher."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Amongst the other things which He <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knew</a> would happen, He <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knew</a> that some would be brought about by His <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; and for these He not unbecomingly besought <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> To rise is nothing more than to move towards what is above. Now movement is taken in two ways, as is said De Anima iii, 7; first, strictly, according as it implies the passing from <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to act, inasmuch as it is the act of something imperfect, and thus to rise pertains to what is <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a> and not actually above. Now in this sense, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 24), "the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not need to rise to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since it was ever united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> both by personal being and by the blessed vision." Secondly, movement signifies the act of something perfect, i.e. something <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in act, as to understand and to feel are called movements; and in this sense the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was always raised up to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since He was always contemplating Him as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> above Himself.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether it pertains to Christ to pray according to His sensuality?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it pertains to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> according to His sensuality. For it is written (<a href="../bible/psa083.htm#verse3">Psalm 83:3</a>) in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Christ: "My heart and My flesh have rejoiced in the Living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Now sensuality is called the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> of the flesh. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sensuality could ascend to the Living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by rejoicing; and with equal reason by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> would seem to pertain to that which desires what is besought. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> besought something that His sensuality desired when He said (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse39">Matthew 26:39</a>): "Let this <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> pass from Me." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sensuality <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is a greater thing to be united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> than to mount to Him in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. But the sensuality was assumed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to the unity of Person, even as every other part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Much more, therefore, could it mount to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse7">Philippians 2:7</a>) that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that He assumed was "made in the likeness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>." But the rest of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> do not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> with their sensuality. Therefore, neither did <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> according to His sensuality.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> To <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> according to sensuality may be understood in two ways. First as if <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> itself were an act of the sensuality; and in this sense <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> with His sensuality, since His sensuality was of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as in us. Now in us the sensuality cannot <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for two reasons; first because the movement of the sensuality cannot transcend sensible things, and, consequently, it cannot mount to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is required for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; secondly, because <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> implies a certain ordering inasmuch as we desire something to be fulfilled by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and this is the work of reason alone. Hence <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is an act of the reason, as was said in the II-II, 83, 1.

<p>Secondly, we may be said to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> according to the sensuality when our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> lays before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> what is in our <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> of sensuality; and in this sense <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> with His sensuality inasmuch as His <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> expressed the desire of His sensuality, as if it were the advocate of the sensuality--and this, that He might teach us three things. First, to show that He had taken a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, with all its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> affections: secondly, to show that a man may wish with his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> desire what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not wish: thirdly, to show that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should subject his own will to the Divine will. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in the Enchiridion (Serm. 1 in Ps. 32): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> acting as a man, shows the proper will of a man when He says 'Let this <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> pass from Me'; for this was the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will desiring something proper to itself and, so to say, private. But because He wishes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be righteous and to be directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He adds: 'Nevertheless not as I will but as Thou wilt,' as if to say, 'See thyself in Me, for thou canst desire something proper to thee, even though <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wishes something else.'"

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The flesh rejoices in the Living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not by the act of the flesh mounting to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but by the outpouring of the heart into the flesh, inasmuch as the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> follows the movement of the rational <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although the sensuality wished what the reason besought, it did not belong to the sensuality to seek this by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, but to the reason, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The union in <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is according to the personal being, which pertains to every part of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; but the uplifting of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is by an act which pertains only to the reason, as stated above. Hence there is no parity.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether it was fitting that Christ should pray for Himself?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it was not fitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for Himself. For <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (De Trin. x): "Although His word of beseeching did not benefit Himself, yet He spoke for the profit of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>." Hence it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> not for Himself but for us.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no one <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> save for what He wishes, because, as was said (1), <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is an unfolding of our will to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that He may fulfil it. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> wished to suffer what He suffered. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Faust. xxvi): "A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, though unwilling, is often <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>; though unwilling, is sad; though unwilling, sleeps; though unwilling, hungers and thirsts. But He" (i.e. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>) "did all these things, because He wished." Therefore it was not fitting that He should <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for Himself.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> says (De Orat. Dom.): "The Doctor of Peace and Master of Unity did not wish <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to be offered individually and privately, lest when we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> we should <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for ourselves alone." Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did what He taught, according to <a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse1">Acts 1:1</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> began to do and to teach." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> never <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for Himself alone.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> Himself said while <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> (<a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse1">John 17:1</a>): "Glorify Thy Son."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for Himself in two ways. First, by expressing the desire of His sensuality, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>); or also of His simple will, considered as a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; as when He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> that the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> might pass from Him (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse39">Matthew 26:39</a>). Secondly, by expressing the desire of His deliberate will, which is considered as reason; as when He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> (<a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse1">John 17:1</a>). And this is reasonable. For as we have said above (1, ad 1) <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> wished to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to His Father in order to give us an example of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>; and also to show that His Father is the author both of His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> procession in the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, and of all the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that He possesses in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now just as in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> He had already received certain <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> from His Father. so there were other <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> which He had not yet received, but which He expected to receive. And therefore, as He gave thanks to the Father for <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> already received in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, by acknowledging Him as the author thereof, as we read (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse27">Matthew 26:27</a>; <a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse41">John 11:41</a>): so also, in recognition of His Father, He besought Him in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for those <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> still due to Him in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, such as the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His body, and the like. And in this He gave us an example, that we should give thanks for benefits received, and ask in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for those we have not as yet.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> is speaking of vocal <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, which was not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to Him for His own sake, but only for ours. Whence he says pointedly that "His word of beseeching did not benefit Himself." For if "the Lord hears the desire of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>," as is said in the <a href="../bible/psa009.htm#verse38">Psalm 9:38</a>, much more the mere will of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has the force of a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> with the Father: wherefore He said (<a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse42">John 11:42</a>): "I <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> that Thou hearest Me always, but because of the people who stand about have I said it, that they may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that Thou hast sent Me."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> wished indeed to suffer what He suffered, at that particular time: nevertheless He wished to obtain, after His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">passion</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His body, which as yet He had not. This <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> He expected to receive from His Father as the author thereof, and therefore it was fitting that He should <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to Him for it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This very <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, while <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, besought for Himself, pertained to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of others according to <a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse25">Romans 4:25</a>: "He rose again for our <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>." Consequently the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> which He offered for Himself was also in a manner offered for others. So also anyone that asks a boon of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that he may use it for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of others, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> not only for himself, but also for others.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether Christ's prayer was always heard?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> was not always heard. For He besought that the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">passion</a> might be taken from Him, as we read (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse39">Matthew 26:39</a>): and yet it was not taken from Him. Therefore it seems that not every <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of His was heard.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of those who crucified Him might be forgiven, as is related (<a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse34">Luke 23:34</a>). Yet not all were pardoned this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> were punished on account thereof. Therefore it seems that not every <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of His was heard.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for them "who would <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him through the word" of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, that they "might all be one in Him," and that they might attain to being with Him (<a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse20">John 17:20-24</a>). But not all attain to this. Therefore not every <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of His was heard.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it is said (<a href="../bible/psa021.htm#verse3">Psalm 21:3</a>) in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Christ: "I shall cry by day, and Thou wilt not hear." Not every <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of His, therefore, was heard.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb005.htm#verse7">Hebrews 5:7</a>): "With a strong cry and tears offering up <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> . . . He was heard for His reverence."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is a certain manifestation of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will. Wherefore, then is the request of one who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> granted, when his <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is fulfilled. Now absolutely speaking the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of reason; for we will absolutely that which we will in accordance with reason's deliberation. Whereas what we will in accordance with the movement of sensuality, or even of the simple will, which is considered as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is willed not absolutely but conditionally [secundum quid]--that is, provided no obstacle be discovered by reason's deliberation. Wherefore such a will should rather be called a "velleity" than an absolute will; because one would will [vellet] if there were no obstacle.

<p>But according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, Christ willed nothing but what He <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knew</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to will. Wherefore every absolute will of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, even <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, was fulfilled, because it was in conformity with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and consequently His every <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> was fulfilled. For in this respect also is it that other men's <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are fulfilled, in that their <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is in conformity with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse27">Romans 8:27</a>: "And He that searcheth the hearts <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a>," that is, approves of, "what the Spirit desireth," that is, what the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> makes the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> to desire: "because He asketh for the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," that is, in conformity with the Divine will.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for the passing of the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> is variously explained by the Saints. For <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> (Super Matth. 31) says: "When He asks that this may pass from Him, He does not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that it may pass by Him, but that others may share in that which passes on from Him to them; So that the sense is: As I am partaking of the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> of the passion, so may others drink of it, with unfailing hope, with unflinching anguish, without fear of death."

<p>Or according to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> (on <a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse39">Matthew 26:39</a>): "He says pointedly, 'This <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>,' that is of the Jewish people, who cannot allege <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> as an excuse for putting Me to death, since they have the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> and the Prophets, who foretold concerning Me."

<p>Or, according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> of Alexandria (De Martyr. ad <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> 7): "When He says 'Remove this <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> from Me,' He does not mean, 'Let it not come to Me'; for if it come not, it cannot be removed. But, as that which passes is neither untouched nor yet permanent, so the Saviour beseeches, that a slightly pressing trial may be repulsed."

<p>Lastly, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a>, <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> and <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> say that He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> thus "as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," being reluctant to die according to His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> will.

<p>Thus, therefore, whether we understand, according to <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a>, that He thus <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> that other <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> might be imitators of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, or that He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> that the fear of drinking His <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> might not trouble Him, or that death might not withhold Him, His <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> was entirely fulfilled. But if we understand that He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> that He might not drink the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">passion</a> and death; or that He might not drink it at the hands of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>; what He besought was not indeed fulfilled, because His reason which formed the petition did not desire its fulfilment, but for our instruction, it was His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> will, and the movement of His sensuality, which was His as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> did not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for all those who crucified Him, as neither did He for all those who would <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him; but for those only who were <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to obtain <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> through Him. Wherefore the reply to the third objection is also manifest.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> When He says: "I shall cry and Thou wilt not hear," we must take this as referring to the desire of sensuality, which shunned death. But He is heard as to the desire of His reason, as stated above.
