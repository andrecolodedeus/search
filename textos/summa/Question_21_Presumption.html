<h1>Question 21. Presumption</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3021.htm#article1"> What is the object in which presumption trusts?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3021.htm#article2"> Is presumption a sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3021.htm#article3"> To what is it opposed?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3021.htm#article4"> From what vice does it arise?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether presumption trusts in God or in our own power?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that presumption, which is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, trusts, not in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but in our own power. For the lesser the power, the more grievously does he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> who trusts in it too much. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> power is less than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a>. Therefore it is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to presume on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> power than to presume on the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is most grievous. Therefore presumption, which is reckoned a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, trusts to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> rather than to Divine power.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> arise from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, for this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is called <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> which is a source from which <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> arise. Now other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> seem to arise from the presumption whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> presumes on himself rather than from the presumption whereby he presumes on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since self-love is the origin of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei xiv, 28). Therefore it seems that presumption which is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, relies chiefly on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> power.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> arises from the inordinate conversion to a mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now presumption is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore it arises from turning to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> power, which is a mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, rather than from turning to the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is an immutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Just as, through <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, a man despises the Divine mercy, on which hope relies, so, through presumption, he despises the Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which punishes the sinner. Now <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> even as mercy is. Therefore, just as <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> consists in aversion from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so presumption consists in inordinate conversion to Him.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Presumption seems to imply immoderate hope. Now the object of hope is an arduous possible <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: and a thing is possible to a man in two ways: first by his own power; secondly, by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. With regard to either hope there may be presumption owing to lack of moderation. As to the hope whereby a man relies on his own power, there is presumption if he tends to a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as though it were possible to him, whereas it surpasses his powers, according to <a href="../bible/jth006.htm#verse15">Judith 6:15</a>: "Thou humblest them that presume of themselves." This presumption is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of magnanimity which holds to the mean in this kind of hope.

<p>But as to the hope whereby a man relies on the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, there may be presumption through immoderation, in the fact that a man tends to some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as though it were possible by the power and mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whereas it is not possible, for instance, if a man hope to obtain pardon without repenting, or <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> without <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>. This presumption is, properly, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, because, to wit, by presuming thus a man removes or despises the assistance of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, whereby he is withdrawn from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (20, 3; I-II, 73, 3) a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is, in its genus, graver than other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Hence presumption whereby a man relies on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> inordinately, is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than the presumption of trusting in one's own power, since to rely on the Divine power for obtaining what is unbecoming to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is to depreciate the Divine power, and it is evident that it is a graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to detract from the Divine power than to exaggerate one's own.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The presumption whereby a man presumes inordinately on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, includes self-love, whereby he loves his own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> inordinately. For when we desire a thing very much, we think we can easily procure it through others, even though we cannot.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Presumption on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> mercy implies both conversion to a mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, in so far as it arises from an inordinate desire of one's own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and aversion from the immutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, in as much as it ascribes to the Divine power that which is unbecoming to it, for thus <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> turns away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> power.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether presumption is a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that presumption is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a reason why <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be heard by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Yet, through presumption some are heard by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for it is written (<a href="../bible/jth009.htm#verse17">Judith 9:17</a>): "Hear me a poor wretch making supplication to Thee, and presuming of Thy mercy." Therefore presumption on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> mercy is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, presumption denotes excessive hope. But there cannot be excess of that hope which is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since His power and mercy are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. Therefore it seems that presumption is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that which is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not excuse from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> says (Sent. ii, D, 22) that "<a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> less, because he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in the hope of pardon," which seems to indicate presumption. Therefore presumption is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is reckoned a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 20, Article 1) with regard to <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, every <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> movement that is conformed to a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in itself and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. Now presumption is an <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> movement, since it denotes an inordinate hope. Moreover it is conformed to a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, just as <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> is: for just as it is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not pardon the repentant, or that He does not turn sinners to repentance, so is it <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> that He grants forgiveness to those who persevere in their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and that He gives <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to those who cease from <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works: and it is to this estimate that the movement of presumption is conformed.

<p>Consequently presumption is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but less grave than <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, since, on account of His <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, it is more proper to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to have mercy and to spare, than to punish: for the former becomes <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in Himself, the latter becomes Him by reason of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Presumption sometimes stands for hope, because even the right hope which we have in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> seems to be presumption, if it be measured according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> estate: yet it is not, if we look at the immensity of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Presumption does not denote excessive hope, as though <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hoped too much in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but through <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hoping to obtain from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> something unbecoming to Him; which is the same as to hope too little in Him, since it implies a depreciation of His power; as stated above (1, ad 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> To <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of persevering in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and through the hope of being pardoned, is presumptuous, and this does not diminish, but increases <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. To <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, however, with the hope of obtaining pardon some time, and with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of refraining from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and of repenting of it, is not presumptuous, but diminishes <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because this seems to indicate a will less hardened in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether presumption is more opposed to fear than to hope?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that presumption is more opposed to fear than to hope. Because inordinate fear is opposed to right fear. Now presumption seems to pertain to inordinate fear, for it is written (<a href="../bible/wis017.htm#verse10">Wisdom 17:10</a>): "A troubled <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> always presumes [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'forecasteth'] grievous things," and (<a href="../bible/wis017.htm#verse11">Wisdom 17:11</a>) that "fear is a help to presumption [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Fear is nothing else but a yielding up of the succours from thought.']." Therefore presumption is opposed to fear rather than to hope.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, contraries are most distant from one another. Now presumption is more distant from fear than from hope, because presumption implies movement to something, just as hope does, whereas fear denotes movement from a thing. Therefore presumption is contrary to fear rather than to hope.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, presumption excludes fear altogether, whereas it does not exclude hope altogether, but only the rectitude of hope. Since therefore contraries destroy one another, it seems that presumption is contrary to fear rather than to hope.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> When two <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are opposed to one another they are contrary to the same <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as timidity and audacity are opposed to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of presumption is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, which is directly opposed to hope. Therefore it seems that presumption also is more directly opposed to hope.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (Contra Julian. iv, 3), "every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> not only has a contrary <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> manifestly distinct from it, as temerity is opposed to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, but also a sort of kindred <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, alike, not in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> but only in its deceitful appearance, as cunning is opposed to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>." This agrees with the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> who says (Ethic. ii, 8) that a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> seems to have more in common with one of the contrary <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> than with the other, as <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> with insensibility, and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> with audacity.

<p>Accordingly presumption appears to be manifestly opposed to fear, especially servile fear, which looks at the punishment arising from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, the remission of which presumption hopes for; yet by a kind of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> likeness it is more opposed to <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, since it denotes an inordinate hope in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And since things are more directly opposed when they belong to the same genus, than when they belong to different genera, it follows that presumption is more directly opposed to hope than to fear. For they both regard and rely on the same object, hope ordinately, presumption inordinately.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Just as hope is misused in speaking of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, and properly applied in speaking of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, so is presumption: it is in this way that inordinate fear is called presumption.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Contraries are things that are most distant from one another within the same genus. Now presumption and hope denote a movement of the same genus, which can be either ordinate or inordinate. Hence presumption is more directly opposed to hope than to fear, since it is opposed to hope in respect of its specific difference, as an inordinate thing to an ordinate one, whereas it is opposed to fear, in respect of its generic difference, which is the movement of hope.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Presumption is opposed to fear by a generic contrariety, and to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of hope by a specific contrariety. Hence presumption excludes fear altogether even generically, whereas it does not exclude hope except by reason of its difference, by excluding its ordinateness.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether presumption arises from vainglory?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that presumption does not arise from vainglory. For presumption seems to rely most of all on the Divine mercy. Now mercy [misericordia] regards unhappiness [miseriam] which is contrary to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Therefore presumption does not arise from vainglory.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, presumption is opposed to <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> arises from sorrow, as stated above (20, 4, ad 2). Since therefore opposites have opposite <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, presumption would seem to arise from pleasure, and consequently from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the flesh, which give the most absorbing pleasure.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of presumption consists in tending to some impossible <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as though it were possible. Now it is owing to <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> that one deems an impossible thing to be possible. Therefore presumption arises from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> rather than from vainglory.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxi, 45) that "presumption of novelties is a daughter of vainglory."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), presumption is twofold; one whereby a man relies on his own power, when he attempts something beyond his power, as though it were possible to him. Such like presumption clearly arises from vainglory; for it is owing to a great desire for <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, that a man attempts things beyond his power, and especially novelties which call for greater admiration. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> states explicitly that presumption of novelties is a daughter of vainglory.

<p>The other presumption is an inordinate trust in the Divine mercy or power, consisting in the hope of obtaining <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> without <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, or pardon without repentance. Such like presumption seems to arise directly from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, as though <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> thought so much of himself as to esteem that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would not punish him or exclude him from <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, however much he might be a sinner.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.
