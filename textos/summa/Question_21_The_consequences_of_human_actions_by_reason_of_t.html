<h1>Question 21. The consequences of human actions by reason of their goodness and malice</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2021.htm#article1"> Is a human action right or sinful by reason of its being good or evil?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2021.htm#article2"> Does it thereby deserve praise or blame?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2021.htm#article3"> Is it accordingly meritorious or demeritorious?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2021.htm#article4"> Is it accordingly meritorious or demeritorious before God?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether a human action is right or sinful, in so far as it is good or evil?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> action is not right or <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, in so far as it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For "monsters are the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>" (Phys. ii, 8). But monsters are not actions, but things engendered outside the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now things that are produced according to art and reason imitate those that are produced according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> (Phys. ii, 8). Therefore an action is not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> by reason of its being inordinate and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated in Phys. ii, 8 occurs in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and art, when the end intended by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or art is not attained. But the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> action depends, before all, on the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the end, and on its achievement. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of an action does not make it <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of an action makes it <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, it follows that wherever there is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, there is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>: since punishment is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, although it is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore an action is not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> by reason of its being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> As shown above (Question 19, Article 4), the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> action depends principally on the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">Eternal</a> Law: and consequently its <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> consists in its being in disaccord with the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">Eternal</a> Law. But this is the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Faust. xxii, 27) that "<a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a word, <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, or desire, in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">Eternal</a> Law." Therefore a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> action is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> by reason of its being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">Evil</a> is more comprehensive than <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as also is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> than right. For every privation of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, in whatever subject, is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: whereas <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> consists properly in an action done for a certain end, and lacking due order to that end. Now the due order to an end is measured by some rule. In things that act according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, this rule is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> force that inclines them to that end. When therefore an action proceeds from a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> force, in accord with the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination to an end, then the action is said to be right: since the mean does not exceed its limits, viz. the action does not swerve from the order of its active principle to the end. But when an action strays from this rectitude, it comes under the notion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>Now in those things that are done by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, the proximate rule is the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, while the supreme rule is the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">Eternal</a> Law. When, therefore, a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> action tends to the end, according to the order of reason and of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">Eternal</a> Law, then that action is right: but when it turns aside from that rectitude, then it is said to be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now it is evident from what has been said (19, 3,4) that every <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> action that turns aside from the order of reason and of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">Eternal</a> Law, is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and that every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> action is in accord with reason and the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">Eternal</a> Law. Hence it follows that a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> action is right or <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> by reason of its being <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Monsters are called <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, inasmuch as they result from a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature's</a> action.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The end is twofold; the last end, and the proximate end. In the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the action does indeed fail in respect of the last end, which is the perfection of the thing generated; but it does not fail in respect of any proximate end whatever; since when <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> works it forms something. In like manner, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> always fails as regards the last end intended, because no <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> action can be ordained to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, which is the last end: and yet it does not fail in respect of some proximate end: intended and achieved by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Wherefore also, since the very <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of this end is ordained to the last end, this same <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> may be right or <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Each thing is ordained to its end by its action: and therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which consists in straying from the order to the end, consists properly in an action. On the other hand, punishment regards the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the sinner, as was stated in the I, 48, 5, ad 4; 6, ad 3.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether a human action deserves praise or blame, by reason of its being good or evil?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> action does not deserve praise or blame by reason of its being <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For "<a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> happens even in things done by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>" (Phys. ii, 8). And yet <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things are not deserving of praise or blame (Ethic. iii, 5). Therefore a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> action does not deserve blame, by reason of its being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> or <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>; and, consequently, neither does it deserve praise, by reason of its being <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> occurs in moral actions, so does it happen in the productions of art: because as stated in Phys. ii, 8 "it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in a grammarian to write badly, and in a <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctor</a> to give the wrong medicine." But the artist is not blamed for making something bad: because the artist's work is such, that he can produce a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or a bad thing, just as he lists. Therefore it seems that neither is there any reason for blaming a moral action, in the fact that it is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is "weak and incapable." But weakness or inability either takes away or diminishes guilt. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> action does not incur guilt from being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Virt. et Vit. i) that "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> deserve praise, while <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> that are opposed to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> deserve censure and blame." But <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> actions are <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>; because "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> makes that which has it, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and makes its action <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" (Ethic. ii, 6): wherefore actions opposed to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> action deserves praise or blame, through being <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Just as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is more comprehensive than <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> more comprehensive than blame. For an action is said to deserve praise or blame, from its being imputed to the agent: since to praise or to blame means nothing else than to impute to someone the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> or <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of his action. Now an action is imputed to an agent, when it is in his power, so that he has dominion over it: because it is through his will that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has dominion over his actions, as was made clear above (1, 1,2). Hence it follows that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, in <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> actions alone, renders them worthy of praise or blame: and in such like actions, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and guilt are one and the same thing.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Natural actions are not in the power of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> agent: since the action of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is determinate. And, therefore, although there be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> actions, there is no blame.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason</a> stands in different relations to the productions of art, and to moral actions. In matters of art, reason is directed to a particular end, which is something devised by reason: whereas in moral matters, it is directed to the general end of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life. Now a particular end is subordinate to the general end. Since therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a departure from the order to the end, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may occur in two ways, in a production of art. First, by a departure from the particular end intended by the artist: and this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> will be proper to the art; for instance, if an artist produce a bad thing, while intending to produce something <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; or produce something <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, while intending to produce something bad. Secondly, by a departure from the general end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life: and then he will be said to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, if he intend to produce a bad work, and does so in effect, so that another is taken in thereby. But this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not proper to the artist as such, but as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Consequently for the former <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> the artist is blamed as an artist; while for the latter he is blamed as a man. On the other hand, in moral matters, where we take into consideration the order of reason to the general end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> are always due to a departure from the order of reason to the general end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is blamed for such a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, both as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and as a moral being. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vi, 5) that "in art, he who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> is preferable; but in <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, as in the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>," which <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> directs, "he is the reverse."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Weakness that occurs in <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, is subject to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> power: wherefore it neither takes away nor diminishes guilt.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether a human action is meritorious or demeritorious in so far as it is good or evil?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> action is not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> or demeritorious on account of its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>. For we speak of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> or demerit in relation to retribution, which has no place save in matters relating to another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil actions</a> are not all related to another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, for some are related to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the agent. Therefore not every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> action is <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> or demeritorious.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no one deserves punishment or reward for doing as he chooses with that of which he is master: thus if a man destroys what belongs to him, he is not punished, as if he had destroyed what belongs to another. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is master of his own actions. Therefore a man does not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> punishment or reward, through putting his action to a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> purpose.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if a man acquire some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for himself, he does not on that account deserve to be benefited by another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: and the same applies to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Now a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> action is itself a kind of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and perfection of the agent: while an inordinate action is his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore a man does not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> or demerit, from the fact that he does a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/isa003.htm#verse10">Isaiah 3:10-11</a>): "Say to the just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that it is well; for he shall eat the fruit of his doings. Woe to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> unto <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; for the reward of his hands shall be given him."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We speak of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> and demerit, in relation to retribution, rendered according to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Now, retribution according to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is rendered to a man, by reason of his having done something to another's advantage or hurt. It must, moreover, be observed that every <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> member of a society is, in a fashion, a part and member of the whole society. Wherefore, any <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, done to the member of a society, redounds on the whole society: thus, who hurts the hand, hurts the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. When, therefore, anyone does <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to another <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, there is a twofold measure of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> or demerit in his action: first, in respect of the retribution owed to him by the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> to whom he has done <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or harm; secondly, in respect of the retribution owed to him by the whole of society. Now when a man ordains his action directly for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of the whole society, retribution is owed to him, before and above all, by the whole society; secondarily, by all the parts of society. Whereas when a man does that which conduces to his own benefit or disadvantage, then again is retribution owed to him, in so far as this too affects the community, forasmuch as he is a part of society: although retribution is not due to him, in so far as it conduces to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or harm of an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, who is identical with the agent: unless, perchance, he owe retribution to himself, by a sort of resemblance, in so far as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is said to be just to himself.

<p>It is therefore evident that a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> action deserves praise or blame, in so far as it is in the power of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: that it is right or <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, according as it is ordained to the end; and that its <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> or demerit depends on the recompense for <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> or <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> towards another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil actions</a>, although not ordained to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of another <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, are nevertheless ordained to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of another, i.e. the community.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> is master of his actions; and yet, in so far as he belongs to another, i.e. the community, of which he forms part, he <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> or demerits, inasmuch as he disposes his actions well or ill: just as if he were to dispense well or ill other belongings of his, in respect of which he is bound to serve the community.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This very <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, which a man does to himself by his action, redounds to the community, as stated above.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether a human action is meritorious or demeritorious before God, according as it is good or evil?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> actions, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, are not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> or demeritorious in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Because, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> and demerit imply relation to retribution for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or harm done to another. But a man's action, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, does no <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or harm to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for it is written (<a href="../bible/job035.htm#verse6">Job 35:6-7</a>): "If thou <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, what shalt thou hurt Him? . . . And if thou do <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>, what shalt thou give Him?" Therefore a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> action, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, is not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> or demeritorious in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, an instrument acquires no <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> or demerit in the sight of him that uses it; because the entire action of the instrument belongs to the user. Now when <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> acts he is the instrument of the Divine power which is the principal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of his action; hence it is written (<a href="../bible/isa010.htm#verse15">Isaiah 10:15</a>): "Shall the axe boast itself against him that cutteth with it? Or shall the saw exalt itself against him by whom it is drawn?" where <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> while acting is evidently compared to an instrument. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> or demerits nothing in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sight, by <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> action acquires <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> or demerit through being ordained to someone else. But not all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions are ordained to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore not every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> action acquires <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> or demerit in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sight.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/ecc012.htm#verse14">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>): "All things that are done, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will bring into judgment . . . whether it be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." Now judgment implies retribution, in respect of which we speak of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> and demerit. Therefore every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> action, both <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, acquires <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> or demerit in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sight.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> action, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), acquires <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> or demerit, through being ordained to someone else, either by reason of himself, or by reason of the community: and in each way, our actions, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, acquire <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> or demerit, in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. On the part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, inasmuch as He is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> last end; and it is our <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to refer all our actions to the last end, as stated above (Question 19, Article 10). Consequently, whoever does an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, not referable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, does not give <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> due to Him as our last end. On the part of the whole community of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, because in every community, he who governs the community, cares, first of all, for the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; wherefore it is his business to award retribution for such things as are done well or ill in the community. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the governor and ruler of the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, as stated in the I, 103, 5: and especially of rational creatures. Consequently it is evident that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions acquire <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> or demerit in reference to Him: else it would follow that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions are no business of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in Himself neither gains nor losses anything by the action of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: but <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, for his part, takes something from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or offers something to Him, when he observes or does not observe the order instituted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> is so moved, as an instrument, by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that, at the same time, he moves himself by his <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, as was explained above (9, 6, ad 3). Consequently, by his action, he acquires <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> or demerit in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sight.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> is not ordained to the body politic, according to all that he is and has; and so it does not follow that every action of his acquires <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> or demerit in relation to the body politic. But all that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is, and can, and has, must be referred to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and therefore every action of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, whether <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or bad, acquires <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> or demerit in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as far as the action itself is concerned.
