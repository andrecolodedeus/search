<h1>Question 21. The definition, congruity and cause of excommunication</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5021.htm#article1"> Is excommunication suitably defined?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5021.htm#article2"> Should the Church excommunicate anyone?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5021.htm#article3"> Should anyone be excommunicated for inflicting temporal harm?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5021.htm#article4"> Does an excommunication unjustly pronounced have any effect?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether excommunication is suitably defined as separation from the communion of the Church, etc?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> is unsuitably defined by some thus: "Excommunication is separation from the communion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as to fruit and general suffrages." For the suffrages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> avail for those for whom they are offered. But the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for those who are outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as, for instance, for <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>. Therefore she <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> also for the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, since they are outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and so the suffrages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> avail for them.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no one loses the suffrages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> except by his own fault. Now <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> is not a fault, but a punishment. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> does not deprive a man of the general suffrages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the fruit of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> seems to be the same as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> suffrages, for it cannot mean the fruit of temporal goods, since <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> does not deprive a man of these. Therefore there is no reason for mentioning both.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, there is a kind of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> called minor*, by which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not deprived of the suffrages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. [Minor <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> is no longer recognized by Canon Law.] Therefore this definition is unsuitable.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> When a man enters the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, he is admitted to two things, viz. the body of the faithful and the participation of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>: and this latter presupposes the former, since the faithful are united together in the participation of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Consequently a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> may be expelled from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in two ways. First, by being deprived merely of the participation of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and this is the minor <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. Secondly, by being deprived of both, and this is the major <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, of which the above is the definition. Nor can there be a third, consisting in the privation of communion with the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, but not of the participation of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, for the reason already given, because, to wit, the faithful communicate together in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Now communion with the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> is twofold. One consists in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, such as their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for one another, and meeting together for the reception of sacred things; while another consists in certain legitimate bodily actions. These different manners of communion are signified in the verse which declares that those who are <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> are deprived of-- "os, orare, vale, communio, mensa." "Os," i.e. we must not give them tokens of goodwill; "orare," i.e. we must not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> with them; "vale," we must not give them marks of respect; "communio," i.e. we must not communicate with them in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>; "mensa," i.e. we must not take meals with them. Accordingly the above definition includes privation of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> in the words "as to the fruit," and from partaking together with the faithful in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, in the words, "and the general <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>." Another definition is given which expresses the privation of both kinds of acts, and is as follows: "Excommunication is the privation of all lawful communion with the faithful."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Prayers are said for unbelievers, but they do not receive the fruit of those <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> unless they be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. In like manner <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> may be offered up for those who are <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, but not among the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> that are said for the members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Yet they do not receive the fruit so long as they remain under the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, but <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are said for them that they may receive the spirit of repentance, so that they may be loosed from <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> One <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> profit another in so far as they can reach to him. Now the action of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may reach to another in two ways. First, by virtue of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> which unites all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, making them one in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa118.htm#verse63">Psalm 118:63</a>: "I am a partaker with all them that fear Thee." Now <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> does not interrupt this union, since no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can be <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> except for a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, whereby a man is already separated from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, even without being <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. An <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> cannot deprive a man of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, since this is one of the greatest of all goods, of which a man cannot be deprived against his will. Secondly, through the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the one who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>, which <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is directed to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for, and this union is interrupted by <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, because by passing sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> severs a man from the whole body of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, for whom she <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>. Hence those <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which are offered up for the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, do not profit those who are <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. Nor can <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> be said for them among the members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as speaking in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> name, although a private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> may say a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of offering it for their conversion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> fruit of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is derived not only from her <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, but also from the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> received and from the faithful dwelling together.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The minor <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> does not fulfill all the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> but only a part of them, hence the definition of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> need not apply to it in every respect, but only in some.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the Church should excommunicate anyone?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> ought not to <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> anyone, because <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> is a kind of curse, and we are forbidden to curse (<a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse14">Romans 12:14</a>). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should not <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Militant should imitate the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Triumphant. Now we read in the <a href="../bible/jud001.htm#verse9">epistle of Jude (verse 9)</a> that "when Michael the Archangel disputing with the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> contended about the body of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, he durst not bring against him the judgment of railing speech, but said: The Lord command thee." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Militant ought not to judge any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by cursing or excommunicating him.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be given into the hands of his enemies, unless there be no hope for him. Now by <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> a man is given into the hands of Satan, as is clear from <a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse5">1 Corinthians 5:5</a>. Since then we should never give up hope about anyone in this life, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should not <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> anyone.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse5">1 Corinthians 5:5</a>) ordered a man to be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>.

<p>Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse17">Matthew 18:17</a>) about the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who refuses to hear the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: "Let him be to thee as the heathen or publican." But <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> are outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Therefore they also who refuse to hear the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, should be banished from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The judgment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should be conformed to the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> punishes the sinner in many ways, in order to draw him to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, either by chastising him with stripes, or by leaving him to himself so that being deprived of those helps whereby he was kept out of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, he may acknowledge his weakness, and humbly return to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Whom he had abandoned in his <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. In both these respects the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by passing sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> imitates the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For by severing a man from the communion of the faithful that he may blush with shame, she imitates the judgment whereby <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> chastises <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with stripes; and by depriving him of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and other <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, she imitates the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in leaving <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to himself, in order that by <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> he may learn to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> himself and return to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A curse may be pronounced in two ways: first, so that the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the one who curses is fixed on the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which he invokes or pronounces, and cursing in this sense is altogether forbidden. Secondly, so that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which a man invokes in cursing is intended for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the one who is <a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">cursed</a>, and thus cursing is sometimes lawful and salutary: thus a physician makes a sick <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> undergo pain, by cutting him, for instance, in order to deliver him from his sickness.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> cannot be brought to repentance, wherefore the pain of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> cannot do him any <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> From the very fact that a man is deprived of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he incurs a triple loss, corresponding to the three things which a man acquires through the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. For they bring an increase of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to those who have it, or <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> for those who have it not; and in this respect the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master of the Sentences</a> says (Sent. iv, D, 18): "The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is taken away by <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>." They also <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> a safeguard of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and in this respect he says that "protection is taken away," not that the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is withdrawn altogether from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, but that he is excluded from that protection with which He watches over the children of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in a more special way. Moreover, they are useful as a defense against the enemy, and in this respect he says that "the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> receives greater power of assaulting the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, both spiritually and corporally." Hence in the early Church, when men had to be enticed to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by means of outward signs (thus the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was shown openly by a visible sign), so too <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> was evidenced by a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> being troubled in his body by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Nor is it unreasonable that one, for whom there is still hope, be given over to the enemy, for he is surrendered, not unto damnation, but unto correction, since the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has the power to rescue him from the hands of the enemy, whenever he is willing.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether anyone should be excommunicated for inflicting temporal harm?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> for inflicting a temporal harm. For the punishment should not exceed the fault. But the punishment of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> is the privation of a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which surpasses all temporal goods. Therefore no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> for temporal injuries.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, we should render to no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, according to the precept of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse17">Romans 12:17</a>). But this would be rendering <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, if a man were to be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> for doing such an injury. Therefore this ought by no means to be done.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Peter sentenced Ananias and Saphira to death for keeping back the price of their piece of land (<a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse1">Acts 5:1-10</a>). Therefore it is lawful for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> for temporal injuries.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> By <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> the ecclesiastical judge excludes a man, in a sense, from the kingdom. Wherefore, since he ought not to exclude from the kingdom others than the unworthy, as was made clear from the definition of the keys (17, 2), and since no one becomes unworthy, unless, through committing a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he lose <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> which is the way leading to the kingdom, it follows that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> except for a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And since by injuring a man in his body or in his temporalities, one may <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> mortally and act against <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> can <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> a man for having inflicted temporal injury on anyone. Yet, as <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> is the most severe punishment, and since punishments are intended as remedies, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. ii), and again since a <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> physician begins with lighter and less risky remedies, therefore <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> should not be inflicted, even for a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, unless the sinner be obstinate, either by not coming up for judgment, or by going away before judgment is pronounced, or by failing to obey the decision of the court. For then, if, after due warning, he refuse to obey, he is reckoned to be obstinate, and the judge, not being able to proceed otherwise against him, must <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A fault is not measured by the extent of the damage a man does, but by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> with which he does it, acting against <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Wherefore, though the punishment of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> exceeds the harm done, it does not exceed the measure of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When a man is corrected by being punished, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not rendered to him, but <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: since punishments are remedies, as stated above.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether an excommunication unjustly pronounced has any effect?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that an <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> which is pronounced <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> has no effect at all. Because <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> deprives a man of the protection and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which cannot be forfeited <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> has no effect if it be <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> pronounced.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (on <a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse19">Matthew 16:19</a>: "I will give to thee the keys"): "It is a <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">pharisaical</a> severity to reckon as really bound or loosed, that which is bound or loosed <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>." But that severity was <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>. Therefore an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> has no effect.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Hom. xxvi in Evang.), "the sentence of the pastor is to be feared whether it be just or <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>." Now there would be no reason to fear an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> if it did not hurt. Therefore, etc.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> An <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> may be <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> for two reasons. First, on the part of its author, as when anyone excommunicates through <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> or <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and then, nevertheless, the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> takes effect, though its author <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, because the one who is <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> suffers <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>, even if the author act wrongly in excommunicating him. Secondly, on the part of the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, through there being no proper <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, or through the sentence being passed without the forms of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> being observed. In this case, if the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, on the part of the sentence, be such as to render the sentence void, this has no effect, for there is no <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>; but if the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> does not annul the sentence, this takes effect, and the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> should humbly submit (which will be credited to him as a <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>), and either seek <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> from the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who has <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> him, or appeal to a higher judge. If, however, he were to contemn the sentence, he would "ipso facto" <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> mortally.

<p>But sometimes it happens that there is sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> on the part of the excommunicator, but not on the part of the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, as when a man is <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> for a crime which he has not committed, but which has been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> against him: in this case, if he submit humbly, the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of his <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> will compensate him for the harm of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although a man cannot lose <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>, yet he can <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> lose those things which on our part dispose us to receive <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. for instance, a man may be deprived of the instruction which he ought to have. It is in this sense that <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> is said to deprive a man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as was explained above (2, ad 3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> is speaking of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not of its punishments, which can be inflicted <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> by ecclesiastical superiors.
