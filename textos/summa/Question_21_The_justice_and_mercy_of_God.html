<h1>Question 21. The justice and mercy of God</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1021.htm#article1"> Is there justice in God?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1021.htm#article2"> Can His justice be called truth?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1021.htm#article3"> Is there mercy in God?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1021.htm#article4"> Are justice and mercy in every work of God?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether there is justice in God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that there is not <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is divided against <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>. But <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: neither therefore does <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, he who does whatsoever he wills and pleases does not work according to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. But, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> worketh all things according to the counsel of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>" (<a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse11">Ephesians 1:11</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> cannot be attributed to Him.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is to pay what is due. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> debtor. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> does not belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, whatever is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> cannot belong to this. For <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Hebdom.): "Good regards the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> the act." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> does not belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/psa010.htm#verse8">Psalm 10:8</a>): "The Lord is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, and hath loved <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There are two kinds of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. The one consists in mutual giving and receiving, as in buying and selling, and other kinds of intercourse and exchange. This the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. v, 4) calls commutative <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, that directs exchange and intercourse of business. This does not belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says: "Who hath first given to Him, and recompense shall be made him?" (<a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse35">Romans 11:35</a>). The other consists in distribution, and is called distributive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; whereby a ruler or a steward gives to each what his rank deserves. As then the proper order displayed in ruling a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> or any kind of multitude evinces <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of this kind in the ruler, so the order of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, which is seen both in effects of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and in effects of will, shows forth the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. viii, 4): "We must needs see that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, in seeing how He gives to all <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> things what is proper to the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of each; and preserves the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of each in the order and with the powers that properly belong to it."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Certain of the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are concerned with the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, as <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> with <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> with fear and daring, meekness with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. Such <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> as these can only metaphorically be attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; since, as stated above (Question 20, Article 1), in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there are no <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>; nor a sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, which is, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 10), the subject of those <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. On the other hand, certain moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are concerned with works of giving and expending; such as <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, liberality, and magnificence; and these reside not in the sensitive faculty, but in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Hence, there is nothing to prevent our attributing these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; although not in civil matters, but in such acts as are not unbecoming to Him. For, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. x, 8), it would be absurd to praise <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for His political <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as perceived by <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, it is impossible for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to will anything but what His wisdom approves. This is, as it were, His <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, in accordance with which His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is right and just. Hence, what He does according to His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> He does <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>: as we do <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> what we do according to <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. But whereas <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> comes to us from some higher power, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> unto Himself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> To each one is due what is his own. Now that which is directed to a man is said to be his own. Thus the master owns the servant, and not conversely, for that is free which is its own <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. In the word debt, therefore, is implied a certain exigence or <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of the thing to which it is directed. Now a twofold order has to be considered in things: the one, whereby one <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> thing is directed to another, as the parts of the whole, <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> to <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, and all things whatsoever to their end; the other, whereby all <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things are ordered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Thus in the divine operations debt may be regarded in two ways, as due either to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or to creatures, and in either way <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> pays what is due. It is due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that there should be fulfilled in creatures what His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and wisdom require, and what manifests His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. In this respect, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> regards what befits Him; inasmuch as He renders to Himself what is due to Himself. It is also due to a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> thing that it should possess what is ordered to it; thus it is due to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to have hands, and that other animals should serve him. Thus also <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> exercises <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, when He gives to each thing what is due to it by its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>. This debt however is derived from the former; since what is due to each thing is due to it as ordered to it according to the divine wisdom. And although <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in this way pays each thing its due, yet He Himself is not the debtor, since He is not directed to other things, but rather other things to Him. Justice, therefore, in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is sometimes spoken of as the fitting accompaniment of His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>; sometimes as the reward of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm</a> touches on either view where he says (Prosolog. 10): "When Thou dost punish the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, since it agrees with their deserts; and when Thou dost spare the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, it is also just; since it befits Thy <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> regards act, this does not prevent its being the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; since even that which is of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of a thing may be the principle of action. But <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> does not always regard act; since a thing is called <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> not merely with respect to act, but also as regards perfection in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. For this reason it is said (De Hebdom.) that the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is related to the just, as the general to the special.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the justice of God is truth?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> resides in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; since, as <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm</a> says (Dial. Verit. 13), it is a rectitude of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, whereas <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> resides in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. vi; Ethic. vi, 2,6). Therefore <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> does not appertain to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iv, 7), <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> distinct from <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Truth therefore does not appertain to the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> it is said (<a href="../bible/psa084.htm#verse11">Psalm 84:11</a>): "Mercy and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> have met each other": where <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> stands for <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Truth consists in the equation of mind and thing, as said above (Question 16, Article 1). Now the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the thing, is related to it as its rule and measure; whereas the converse is the case with the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> that receives its <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from things. When therefore things are the measure and rule of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> consists in the equation of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to the thing, as happens in ourselves. For according as a thing is, or is not, our thoughts or our words about it are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> or <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. But when the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is the rule or measure of things, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> consists in the equation of the thing to the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>; just as the work of an artist is said to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, when it is in accordance with his art.

<p>Now as works of art are related to art, so are works of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> related to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> with which they accord. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which establishes things in the order conformable to the rule of His wisdom, which is the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, is suitably called <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Thus we also in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs speak of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Justice, as to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> that governs, resides in the reason or <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; but as to the command whereby our actions are governed according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, it resides in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of which the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> is speaking in this passage, is that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> whereby a man shows himself in word and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> such as he really is. Thus it consists in the conformity of the sign with the thing signified; and not in that of the effect with its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and rule: as has been said regarding the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether mercy can be attributed to God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that mercy cannot be attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For mercy is a kind of sorrow, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 14). But there is no sorrow in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and therefore there is no mercy in Him.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, mercy is a relaxation of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot remit what appertains to His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. For it is said (<a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse13">2 Timothy 2:13</a>): "If we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not, He continueth faithful: He cannot deny Himself." But He would deny Himself, as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says, if He should deny His words. Therefore mercy is not becoming to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> it is said (<a href="../bible/psa110.htm#verse4">Psalm 110:4</a>): "He is a merciful and gracious Lord."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Mercy is especially to be attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as seen in its effect, but not as an affection of passion. In <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of which it must be considered that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is said to be merciful [misericors], as being, so to speak, sorrowful at heart [miserum cor]; being affected with sorrow at the misery of another as though it were his own. Hence it follows that he endeavors to dispel the misery of this other, as if it were his; and this is the effect of mercy. To sorrow, therefore, over the misery of others belongs not to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but it does most properly belong to Him to dispel that misery, whatever be the defect we call by that name. Now defects are not removed, except by the perfection of some kind of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>; and the primary source of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as shown above (Question 6, Article 4). It must, however, be considered that to bestow perfections appertains not only to the divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, but also to His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, liberality, and mercy; yet under different aspects. The communicating of perfections, absolutely considered, appertains to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, as shown above (6, 1, 4); in so far as perfections are given to things in proportion, the bestowal of them belongs to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as has been already said (1); in so far as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not bestow them for His own use, but only on account of His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, it belongs to liberality; in so far as perfections given to things by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> expel defects, it belongs to mercy.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument is based on mercy, regarded as an affection of passion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> acts mercifully, not indeed by going against His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but by doing something more than <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; thus a man who pays another two hundred pieces of money, though owing him only one hundred, does nothing against <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but acts liberally or mercifully. The case is the same with one who pardons an offence committed against him, for in remitting it he may be said to bestow a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> calls remission a forgiving: "Forgive one another, as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has forgiven you" (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse32">Ephesians 4:32</a>). Hence it is clear that mercy does not destroy <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but in a sense is the fulness thereof. And thus it is said: "Mercy exalteth itself above judgment" (<a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse13">James 2:13</a>).

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether in every work of God there are mercy and justice?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that not in every work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are mercy and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. For some works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are attributed to mercy, as the justification of the ungodly; and others to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as the damnation of the wicked. Hence it is said: "Judgment without mercy to him that hath not done mercy" (<a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse13">James 2:13</a>). Therefore not in every work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> do mercy and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> appear.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> attributes the conversion of the Jews to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but that of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to mercy (<a href="../bible/rom015.htm">Romans 15</a>). Therefore not in every work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and mercy.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, many just <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are afflicted in this world; which is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>. Therefore not in every work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and mercy.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it is the part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to pay what is due, but of mercy to relieve misery. Thus both <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and mercy presuppose something in their works: whereas creation presupposes nothing. Therefore in creation neither mercy nor <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is found.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/psa024.htm#verse10">Psalm 24:10</a>): "All the ways of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> are mercy and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Mercy and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> found in all <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> works, if mercy be taken to mean the removal of any kind of defect. Not every defect, however, can properly be called a misery; but only defect in a rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> whose lot is to be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>; for misery is opposed to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. For this <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> there is a reason, because since a debt paid according to the divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is one due either to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or to some creature, neither the one nor the other can be lacking in any work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can do nothing that is not in accord with His wisdom and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>; and it is in this sense, as we have said, that anything is due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Likewise, whatever is done by Him in <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things, is done according to proper order and proportion wherein consists the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Thus <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> must <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in all <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> works. Now the work of divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> always presupposes the work of mercy; and is founded thereupon. For nothing is due to creatures, except for something pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in them, or foreknown. Again, if this is due to a creature, it must be due on account of something that precedes. And since we cannot go on to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>, we must come to something that depends only on the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the divine will--which is the ultimate end. We may say, for instance, that to possess hands is due to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> on account of his rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and his rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is due to him that he may be <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; and his being <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is on account of the divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. So in every work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, viewed at its primary source, there appears mercy. In all that follows, the power of mercy remains, and works indeed with even greater force; as the influence of the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is more intense than that of second <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. For this reason does <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> out of abundance of His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> bestow upon creatures what is due to them more bountifully than is proportionate to their deserts: since less would suffice for preserving the order of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> than what the divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> confers; because between creatures and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> there can be no proportion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Certain works are attributed to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and certain others to mercy, because in some <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> appears more forcibly and in others mercy. Even in the damnation of the reprobate mercy is seen, which, though it does not totally remit, yet somewhat alleviates, in punishing short of what is deserved.

<p>In the justification of the ungodly, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is seen, when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> remits <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> on account of love, though He Himself has mercifully infused that love. So we read of <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Magdalen</a>: "Many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven her, because she hath loved much" (<a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse47">Luke 7:47</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and mercy appear both in the conversion of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. But an aspect of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> appears in the conversion of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> which is not seen in the conversion of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>; inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> were saved on account of the promises made to the fathers.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Justice and mercy appear in the punishment of the just in this world, since by afflictions lesser faults are cleansed in them, and they are the more raised up from earthly affections to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. As to this <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxvi, 9): "The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> that press on us in this world force us to go to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Although creation presupposes nothing in the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>; yet it does presuppose something in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In this way too the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is preserved in creation; by the production of beings in a manner that accords with the divine wisdom and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of mercy, also, is preserved in the change of creatures from non-existence to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>.
