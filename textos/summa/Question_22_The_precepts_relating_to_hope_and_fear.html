<h1>Question 22. The precepts relating to hope and fear</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3022.htm#article1"> The precepts relating to hope</a> <li><a href="../summa/3022.htm#article2"> The precepts relating to fear</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether there should be a precept of hope?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that no precept should be given relating to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of hope. For when an effect is sufficiently procured by one <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, there is no need to induce it by another. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is sufficiently induced by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination to hope for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore there is no need of a precept of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> to induce him to do this.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, since precepts are given about acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, the chief precepts are about the acts of the chief <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Now the chief of all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are the three theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, viz. hope, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Consequently, as the chief precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> are those of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>, to which all others may be reduced, as stated above (I-II, 100, 3), it seems that if any precept of hope were given, it should be found among the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>. But it is not to be found there. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> should contain no precept of hope.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to prescribe an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is equivalent to a prohibition of the act of the opposite <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. Now no precept is to be found forbidding <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> which is contrary to hope. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> should contain no precept of hope.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says on <a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse12">John 15:12</a>, "This is My commandment, that you love one another" (Tract. lxxxiii in Joan.): "How many things are commanded us about <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>! How many relating to hope!" Therefore it is fitting that some precepts should be given about hope.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Among the precepts contained in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>, some belong to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, others are preambles to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. The preambles to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> are those without which no <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is possible: such are the precepts relating to the act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the act of hope, because the act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> inclines <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> mind so that he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> the Author of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> to be One to Whom he owes submission, while, by the hope of a reward, he is induced to observe the precepts. The precepts that belong to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> are those which relate to right conduct and are imposed on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> already subject and ready to obey: wherefore when the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> was given these precepts were set forth from the very outset under form of a command.

<p>Yet the precepts of hope and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> were not to be given under the form of a command, since, unless <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> already <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> and hoped, it would be useless to give him the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>: but, just as the precept of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> had to be given under the form of an announcement or reminder, as stated above (Question 16, Article 1), so too, the precept of hope, in the first promulgation of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, had to be given under the form of a promise. For he who promises rewards to them that obey him, by that very fact, urges them to hope: hence all the promises contained in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> are incitements to hope.

<p>Since, however, when once the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> has been given, it is for a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to induce men not only to observe the precepts, but also, and much more, to safeguard the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, therefore, after the first promulgation of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> holds out to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> many inducements to <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, even by way of warning or command, and not merely by way of promise, as in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>; for instance, in the <a href="../bible/psa061.htm#verse9">Psalm 61:9</a>: "Hope [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'Trust'] in Him all ye congregation of the people," and in many other passages of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> inclines us to hope for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is proportionate to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; but for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to hope for a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> he had to be induced by the authority of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, partly by promises, partly by admonitions and commands. Nevertheless there was need for precepts of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> to be given even for those things to which <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> inclines us, such as the acts of the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, for sake of insuring a greater stability, especially since the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was clouded by the lusts of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The precepts of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> belong to the first promulgation of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>: hence there was no need for a precept of hope among the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>, and it was enough to induce men to hope by the inclusion of certain promises, as in the case of the first and fourth commandments.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In those observances to which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is bound as under a <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, it is enough that he receive an affirmative precept as to what he has to do, wherein is implied the prohibition of what he must avoid doing: thus he is given a precept concerning the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> due to parents, but not a prohibition against dishonoring them, except by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> inflicting punishment on those who dishonor their parents. And since in order to be saved it is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to hope in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he had to be induced to do so by one of the above ways, affirmatively, so to speak, wherein is implied the prohibition of the opposite.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether there should have been given a precept of fear?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that, in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, there should not have been given a precept of fear. For the fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is about things which are a preamble to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, since it is the "beginning of wisdom." Now things which are a preamble to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> do not come under a precept of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. Therefore no precept of fear should be given in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, given the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, the effect is also given. Now love is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of fear, since "every fear proceeds from some kind of love," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (Qq. lxxxiii, qu. 33). Therefore given the precept of love, it would have been superfluous to command fear.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, presumption, in a way, is opposed to fear. But the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> contains no prohibition against presumption. Therefore it seems that neither should any precept of fear have been given.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/deu010.htm#verse12">Deuteronomy 10:12</a>): "And now, <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, what doth the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> require of thee, but that thou fear the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>?"

<p>But He requires of us that which He commands us to do. Therefore it is a matter of precept that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should fear <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Fear is twofold, servile and filial. Now just as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is induced, by the hope of rewards, to observe precepts of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, so too is he induced thereto by the fear of punishment, which fear is servile.

<p>And just as according to what has been said (1), in the promulgation of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> there was no need for a precept of the act of hope, and men were to be induced thereto by promises, so neither was there need for a precept, under form of command, of fear which regards punishment, and men were to be induced thereto by the threat of punishment: and this was realized both in the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>, and afterwards, in due sequence, in the secondary precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>.

<p>Yet, just as wise men and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> who, consequently, strove to strengthen <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the observance of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, delivered their teaching about hope under the form of admonition or command, so too did they in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of fear.

<p>On the other hand filial fear which shows reverence to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is a sort of genus in respect of the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and a kind of principle of all observances connected with reverence for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence precepts of filial fear are given in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, even as precepts of love, because each is a preamble to the external acts prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> and to which the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> refer. Hence in the passage quoted in the argument, "On the contrary," <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is required "to have fear, to walk in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> ways," by worshipping Him, and "to love Him."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Filial fear is a preamble to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, not as though it were extrinsic thereto, but as being the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, just as love is. Hence precepts are given of both, since they are like general principles of the whole Law.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> From love proceeds filial fear as also other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works that are done from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Hence, just as after the precept of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, precepts are given of the other acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, so at the same time precepts are given of fear and of the love of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, just as, in demonstrative <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, it is not enough to lay down the first principles, unless the conclusions also are given which follow from them proximately or remotely.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Inducement to fear suffices to exclude presumption, even as inducement to hope suffices to exclude <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, as stated above (1, ad 3).
