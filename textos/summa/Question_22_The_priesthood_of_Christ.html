<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether it is fitting that Christ should be a priest?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem unfitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should be a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. For a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is less than an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>; whence it is written (<a href="../bible/zec003.htm#verse1">Zechariah 3:1</a>): "The Lord showed me the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> standing before the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is greater than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, according to <a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse4">Hebrews 1:4</a>: "Being made so much better than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as He hath inherited a more excellent name than they." Therefore it is unfitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should be a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, things which were in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> were figures of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to <a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse17">Colossians 2:17</a>: "Which are a shadow of things to come, but the body is Christ's." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not descended from the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb007.htm#verse14">Hebrews 7:14</a>): "It is evident that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> sprang out of Judah, in which tribe <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> spoke nothing concerning <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>." Therefore it is not fitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should be a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, which is a figure of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the lawgivers and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were distinct: wherefore the Lord said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> the lawgiver (<a href="../bible/exo028.htm#verse1">Exodus 28:1</a>): "Take unto thee <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, thy brother . . . that he [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'they'] may minister to Me in the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> office." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the giver of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, according to <a href="../bible/jer031.htm#verse33">Jeremiah 31:33</a>: "I will give My <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in their bowels." Therefore it is unfitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should be a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/heb004.htm#verse14">Hebrews 4:14</a>): "We have [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Having'] therefore a great <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> that hath passed into the heavens, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The office proper to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is to be a mediator between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the people: to wit, inasmuch as He bestows Divine things on the people, wherefore "sacerdos" [<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>] means a giver of sacred things [sacra dans, according to <a href="../bible/mal002.htm#verse7">Malachi 2:7</a>: "They shall seek the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> at his," i.e. the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a>, "mouth"; and again, forasmuch as he offers up the people's <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and, in a manner, makes satisfaction to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb005.htm#verse1">Hebrews 5:1</a>): "Every <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> taken from among men is ordained for men in the things that appertain to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that he may offer up <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." Now this is most befitting to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For through Him are <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> bestowed on men, according to <a href="../bible/2pe001.htm#verse4">2 Peter 1:4</a>: "By Whom" (i.e. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>) "He hath given us most great and precious promises, that by these you may be made partakers of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>." Moreover, He reconciled the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse19">Colossians 1:19-20</a>: "In Him" (i.e. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>) "it hath well pleased (the Father) that all fulness should dwell, and through Him to reconcile all things unto Himself." Therefore it is most fitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should be a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Hierarchical power appertains to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, inasmuch as they also are between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> explains (Coel. Hier. ix), so that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> himself, as being between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, is called an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mal002.htm#verse7">Malachi 2:7</a>: "He is the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was greater than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, not only in His Godhead, but also in His humanity, as having the fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Wherefore also He had the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchical</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> power in a higher degree than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, so that even the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were ministers of His <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse11">Matthew 4:11</a>: "Angels came and ministered unto Him." But, in regard to His passibility, He "was made a little lower than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>," as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse9">Hebrews 2:9</a>): and thus He was conformed to those wayfarers who are ordained to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 26): "What is like in every particular must be, of course, identical, and not a copy." Since, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was a figure of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, He did not wish to be born of the stock of the figurative <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, that it might be made clear that His <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> is not quite the same as theirs, but differs therefrom as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from figure.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (7, 7, ad 1), other men have certain <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> distributed among them: but <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as being the Head of all, has the perfection of all <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>. Wherefore, as to others, one is a lawgiver, another is a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, another is a king; but all these concur in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as the fount of all <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/isa033.htm#verse22">Isaiah 33:22</a>): "The Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>-giver, the Lord is our King: He will" come and "save us."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether Christ was Himself both priest and victim?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself was not both <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and victim. For it is the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to slay the victim. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not kill Himself. Therefore He was not both <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and victim.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has a greater similarity to the Jewish <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, instituted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, than to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, by which the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> were worshiped. Now in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">old Law</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was never offered up in sacrifice: whereas this was very much to be reprehended in the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa105.htm#verse38">Psalm 105:38</a>: "They shed innocent blood; the blood of their sons and of their daughters, which they sacrificed to the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> of Chanaan." Therefore in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> the Man Christ should not have been the victim.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every victim, through being offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But the humanity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was from the beginning <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> and united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore it cannot be said fittingly that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was a victim.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse2">Ephesians 5:2</a>): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> hath loved us, and hath delivered Himself for us, an oblation and a victim [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'sacrifice'] to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for an odor of sweetness."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei x, 5): "Every visible sacrifice is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, that is a sacred sign, of the invisible sacrifice." Now the invisible sacrifice is that by which a man offers his spirit to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa050.htm#verse19">Psalm 50:19</a>: "A sacrifice to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is an afflicted spirit." Wherefore, whatever is offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in order to raise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> spirit to Him, may be called a sacrifice.

<p>Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is required to offer sacrifice for three reasons. First, for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, by which he is turned away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb005.htm#verse1">Hebrews 5:1</a>) that it appertains to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> "to offer <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." Secondly, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may be preserved in a state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a>, by ever adhering to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, wherein his peace and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> consist. Wherefore under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">old Law</a> the sacrifice of peace-offerings was offered up for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the offerers, as is prescribed in the <a href="../bible/lev003.htm">third chapter of Leviticus</a>. Thirdly, in order that the spirit of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be perfectly united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: which will be most perfectly realized in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Hence, under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a> was offered, so called because the victim was wholly burnt, as we read in the first chapter of Leviticus.

<p>Now these effects were conferred on us by the humanity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For, in the first place, our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> were blotted out, according to <a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse25">Romans 4:25</a>: "Who was delivered up for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." Secondly, through Him we received the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, according to <a href="../bible/heb005.htm#verse9">Hebrews 5:9</a>: "He became to all that obey Him the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>." Thirdly, through Him we have acquired the perfection of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, according to <a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse19">Hebrews 10:19</a>: "We have [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Having'] a confidence in the entering into the Holies" (i.e. the heavenly <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>) "through His Blood." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, was not only <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, but also a perfect victim, being at the same time victim for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, victim for a peace-offering, and a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not slay Himself, but of His own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> He exposed Himself to death, according to <a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse7">Isaiah 53:7</a>: "He was offered because it was His own will." Thus He is said to have offered Himself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The slaying of the Man Christ may be referred to a twofold will. First, to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of those who slew Him: and in this respect He was not a victim: for the slayers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> are not accounted as offering a sacrifice to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but as guilty of a great crime: a similitude of which was borne by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, in which they offered up men to idols. Secondly, the slaying of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> may be considered in reference to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Sufferer, Who freely offered Himself to suffering. In this respect He is a victim, and in this He differs from the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. (The reply to the third objection is wanting in the original manuscripts, but it may be gathered from the above.--Ed.) [Some editions, however, give the following reply:

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The fact that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> manhood was <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> from its beginning does not prevent that same manhood, when it was offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, being sanctified in a new way--namely, as a victim actually offered then. For it acquired then the actual <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of a victim, from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> which it had from the beginning, and from the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of union sanctifying it absolutely.]

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the effect of Christ's priesthood is the expiation of sins?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the effect of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> is not the expiation of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For it belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone to blot out <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, according to <a href="../bible/isa043.htm#verse25">Isaiah 43:25</a>: "I am He that blot out thy iniquities for My own sake." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, not as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> does not expiate <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse1">Hebrews 10:1-3</a>) that the victims of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> could not "make" (the comers thereunto) "perfect: for then they would have ceased to be offered; because the worshipers once cleansed should have no <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> any longer; but in them there is made a commemoration of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> every year." But in like manner under the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> a commemoration of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is made in the words: "Forgive us our trespasses" (<a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse12">Matthew 6:12</a>). Moreover, the Sacrifice is offered continuously in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; wherefore again we say: "Give us this day our daily bread." Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not expiated by the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in the sin-offerings of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, a he-goat was mostly offered for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of a prince, a she-goat for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of some private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, a calf for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, as we gather from <a href="../bible/lev004.htm#verse3">Leviticus 4:3-28</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is compared to none of these, but to the lamb, according to <a href="../bible/jer011.htm#verse19">Jeremiah 11:19</a>: "I was as a meek lamb, that is carried to be a victim." Therefore it seems that His <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> does not expiate <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse14">Hebrews 9:14</a>): "The blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> offered Himself unspotted unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, shall cleanse our <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> from dead works, to serve the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." But dead works denote <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has the power to cleanse from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Two things are required for the perfect cleansing from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, corresponding to the two things comprised in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>--namely, the stain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and the debt of punishment. The stain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is, indeed, blotted out by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, by which the sinner's heart is turned to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: whereas the debt of punishment is entirely removed by the satisfaction that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> offers to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> produces both these effects. For by its <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is given to us, by which our hearts are turned to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse24">Romans 3:24-25</a>: "Being justified freely by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, through the redemption that is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, Whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath proposed to be a propitiation, through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in His blood." Moreover, He satisfied for us fully, inasmuch as "He hath borne our infirmities and carried our sorrows" (<a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse4">Isaiah 53:4</a>). Wherefore it is clear that the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has full power to expiate <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, not as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, yet one and the same was both <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore in the Council of Ephesus [Part III, ch. i, anath. 10] we read: "If anyone say that the very <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> did not become our High-Priest and Apostle, when He became flesh and a man like us, but altogether another one, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> born of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>." Hence in so far as His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> operated by virtue of the Divine, that sacrifice was most efficacious for the blotting out of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For this reason <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iv, 14): "So that, since four things are to be observed in every sacrifice--to whom it is offered, by whom it is offered, what is offered, for whom it is offered; the same one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Mediator reconciling us to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the sacrifice of peace, was one with Him to Whom it was offered, united in Himself those for whom He offered it, at the same time offered it Himself, and was Himself that which He offered."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">Sins</a> are commemorated in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, not on account of the inefficacy of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as though <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> were not sufficiently expiated by Him: but in regard to those who either are not willing to be participators in His sacrifice, such as unbelievers, for whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that they be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>; or who, after taking part in this sacrifice, fall away from it by whatsoever kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. The Sacrifice which is offered every day in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is not distinct from that which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself offered, but is a commemoration thereof. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. De. x, 20): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself both is the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who offers it and the victim: the sacred token of which He wished to be the daily Sacrifice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> says (Sup. Joan. i, 29), though various animals were offered up under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, yet the daily sacrifice, which was offered up morning and evening, was a lamb, as appears from <a href="../bible/num028.htm#verse3">Numbers 28:3-4</a>. By which it was signified that the offering up of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> lamb, i.e. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, was the culminating sacrifice of all. Hence (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse29">John 1:29</a>) it is said: "Behold the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, behold Him Who taketh away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: '<a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>'] of the world."

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the effect of the priesthood of Christ pertained not only to others, but also to Himself?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the effect of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> pertained not only to others, but also to Himself. For it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> office to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the people, according to <a href="../bible/2ma001.htm#verse23">2 Maccabees 1:23</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> made <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> while the sacrifice was consuming." Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> not only for others, but also for Himself, as we have said above (Question 21, Article 3), and as expressly stated (<a href="../bible/heb005.htm#verse7">Hebrews 5:7</a>): "In the days of His flesh, with a strong cry and tears He offered [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'offering'] up <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and supplications to Him that was able to save Him from death." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had an effect not only in others, but also in Himself.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">passion</a> Christ offered Himself as a sacrifice. But by His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">passion</a> He <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a>, not only for others, but also for Himself, as stated above (19, 3,4). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had an effect not only in others, but also in Himself.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was a figure of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> offered sacrifice not only for others, but also for himself: for it is written (<a href="../bible/lev016.htm#verse17">Leviticus 16:17</a>) that "the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> goeth into the sanctuary to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for himself and his house, and for the whole congregation of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> also had an effect not merely in others, but also in Himself.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> We read in the acts of the Council of Ephesus [Part III, ch. i, anath. 10]: "If anyone say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> offered sacrifice for Himself, and not rather for us alone (for He Who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> needed no sacrifice), let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> office consists principally in offering sacrifice. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had no effect in Himself.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is set between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Now he needs someone between himself and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who of himself cannot approach to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and such a one is subject to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> by sharing in the effect thereof. But this cannot be said of Christ; for the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb007.htm#verse25">Hebrews 7:25</a>): "Coming of Himself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, always living to make intercession for us [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'He is able to save for ever them that come to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by Him; always living,' etc.]." And therefore it is not fitting for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be the recipient of the effect of His <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, but rather to communicate it to others. For the influence of the first agent in every genus is such that it receives nothing in that genus: thus the sun gives but does not receive light; fire gives but does not receive heat. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the fountain-head of the entire <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was a figure of Him; while the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> works in His <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, according to <a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse10">2 Corinthians 2:10</a>: "For what I have pardoned, if I have pardoned anything, for your sakes have I done it in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." Therefore it is not fitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should receive the effect of His <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is befitting to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, it is not their proper office, for it is befitting to everyone to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> both for himself and for others, according to <a href="../bible/jam005.htm#verse16">James 5:16</a>: "Pray for one another that you may be saved." And so we may say that the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> by which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for Himself was not an action of His <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. But this answer seems to be precluded by the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>, who, after saying (<a href="../bible/heb005.htm#verse6">Hebrews 5:6</a>), "Thou art a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> for ever according to the order of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a>," adds, "Who in the days of His flesh offering up payers," etc., as quoted above (Objection 1): so that it seems that the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> offered pertained to His <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. We must therefore say that other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> partake in the effect of their <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, not as <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, but as sinners, as we shall state farther on (ad 3). But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had, simply speaking, no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; though He had the "likeness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the flesh [Vulg.,: '<a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> flesh'," as is written <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse3">Romans 8:3</a>. And, consequently, we must not say simply that He partook of the effect of His <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> but with this qualification--in regard to the passibility of the flesh. Wherefore he adds pointedly, "that was able to save Him from death."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Two things may be considered in the offering of a sacrifice by any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>--namely, the sacrifice itself which is offered, and the devotion of the offerer. Now the proper effect of <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> is that which results from the sacrifice itself. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> obtained a result from His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">passion</a>, not as by virtue of the sacrifice, which is offered by way of satisfaction, but by the very devotion with which out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> He humbly endured the passion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A figure cannot equal the reality, wherefore the figural <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> could not attain to such perfection as not to need a sacrifice of satisfaction. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not stand in need of this. Consequently, there is no comparison between the two; and this is what the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb007.htm#verse28">Hebrews 7:28</a>): "The Law maketh men <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, who have infirmity; but the word of the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, which was since the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, the Son Who is perfected for evermore."

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the priesthood of Christ endures for ever?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> does not endure for ever. For as stated above (4, ad 1,3) those alone need the effect of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> who have the weakness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which can be expiated by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> sacrifice. But this will not be for ever. For in the Saints there will be no weakness, according to <a href="../bible/isa060.htm#verse21">Isaiah 60:21</a>: "Thy people shall be all just": while no expiation will be possible for the weakness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, since "there is no redemption in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>" (<a href="../cathen/11220a.htm">Office of the Dead</a>, Resp. vii). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> endures not for ever.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was made manifest most of all in His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">passion</a> and death, when "by His own blood He entered into the Holies" (<a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse12">Hebrews 9:12</a>). But the passion and death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> will not endure for ever, as stated <a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse9">Romans 6:9</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> rising again from the dead, dieth now no more." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> will not endure for ever.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, not as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But at one time <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, namely during the three days He lay dead. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> endures not for ever.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa109.htm#verse4">Psalm 109:4</a>): "Thou art a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> for ever."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> office, we may consider two things: first, the offering of the sacrifice; secondly, the consummation of the sacrifice, consisting in this, that those for whom the sacrifice is offered, obtain the end of the sacrifice. Now the end of the sacrifice which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> offered consisted not in temporal but in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which we obtain through His death, according to <a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse11">Hebrews 9:11</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'being come'] a <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to come"; for which reason the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is said to be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. Now this consummation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sacrifice was foreshadowed in this, that the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, once a year, entered into the Holy of Holies with the blood of a he-goat and a calf, as laid down, <a href="../bible/lev016.htm#verse11">Leviticus 16:11</a>, and yet he offered up the he-goat and calf not within the Holy of Holies, but without. In like manner <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> entered into the Holy of Holies--that is, into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>--and prepared the way for us, that we might enter by the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of His blood, which He shed for us on earth.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The Saints who will be in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> will not need any further expiation by the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but having expiated, they will need consummation through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself, on Whom their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> depends, as is written (<a href="../bible/rev021.htm#verse23">Apocalypse 21:23</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath enlightened it"--that is, the city of the Saints--"and the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a> is the lamp thereof."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's passion</a> and death are not to be repeated, yet the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of that Victim endures for ever, for, as it is written (<a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse14">Hebrews 10:14</a>), "by one oblation He hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified."

<p>Wherefore the reply to the third objection is clear.

<p>As to the unity of this sacrifice, it was foreshadowed in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> in that, once a year, the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> entered into the Holies, with a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> oblation of blood, as set down, <a href="../bible/lev016.htm#verse11">Leviticus 16:11</a>. But the figure fell short of the reality in this, that the victim had not an everlasting <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, for which reason those <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> were renewed every year.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the priesthood of Christ was according to the order of Melchisedech?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> was not according to the order of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the fountain-head of the entire <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, as being the principal <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Now that which is principal is not . secondary in regard to others, but others are secondary in its regard. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should not be called a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> according to the order of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was more akin to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> than was the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> before the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. But the nearer the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> were to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the more clearly they signified Him; as is clear from what we have said in the II-II, 2, 7. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should be denominated after the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, rather than after the order of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a>, which was before the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/heb007.htm#verse2">Hebrews 7:2-3</a>): "That is 'king of peace,' without father, without mother, without genealogy; having neither beginning of days nor ending of life": which can be referred only to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should not be called a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> according to the order of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a>, as of some one else, but according to His own order.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa109.htm#verse4">Psalm 109:4</a>): "Thou art a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> for ever according to the order of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (4, ad 3) the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> was a figure of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, not as adequately representing the reality, but as falling far short thereof: both because the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> did not wash away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and because it was not <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Now the excellence of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> over the Levitical <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> was foreshadowed in the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a>, who received <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> from <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, in whose loins the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> was tithed. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is said to be "according to the order of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a>," on account of the excellence of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> over the figural <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is said to be according to the order of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a> not as though the latter were a more excellent <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, but because he foreshadowed the excellence of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> over the Levitical <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Two things may be considered in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>: namely, the offering made by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and (our) partaking thereof. As to the actual offering, the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was more distinctly foreshadowed by the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, by reason of the shedding of blood, than by the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a> in which there was no blood-shedding. But if we consider the participation of this sacrifice and the effect thereof, wherein the excellence of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> over the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> principally consists, then the former was more distinctly foreshadowed by the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a>, who offered bread and wine, signifying, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. xxvi in Joan.) <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">ecclesiastical unity</a>, which is established by our taking part in the sacrifice of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> [Cf. 79, 1]. Wherefore also in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sacrifice of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is presented to the faithful under the form of bread and wine.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a> is described as "without father, without mother, without genealogy," and as "having neither beginning of days nor ending of life," not as though he had not these things, but because these details in his regard are not supplied by <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Scripture</a>. And this it is that, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says in the same passage, he is "likened unto the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>," Who had no earthly father, no heavenly mother, and no genealogy, according to <a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse8">Isaiah 53:8</a>: "Who shall declare His generation?" and Who in His Godhead has neither beginning nor end of days.
