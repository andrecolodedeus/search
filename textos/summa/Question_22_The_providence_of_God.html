<h1>Question 22. The providence of God</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1022.htm#article1"> Is providence suitably assigned to God?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1022.htm#article2"> Does everything come under divine providence?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1022.htm#article3"> Is divine providence immediately concerned with all things?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1022.htm#article4"> Does divine providence impose any necessity upon things foreseen?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether providence can suitably be attributed to God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> is not becoming to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, according to Tully (De Invent. ii), is a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. But <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, since, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vi, 5,9,18), it gives <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel, cannot belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who never has any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> for which He should take counsel. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> cannot belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. But <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> is not anything <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, for it is concerned with <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> things that are not <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. ii, 29). Therefore there is no <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, there is nothing composite in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> seems to be something composite, because it includes both the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> is not in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/wis014.htm#verse3">Wisdom 14:3</a>): "But Thou, Father, governest all things by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> [Vulg. But 'Thy <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, O Father, governeth it.']."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to attribute <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For all the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that is in <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things has been <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as was shown above (Question 6, Article 4). In <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is found not only as regards their <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, but also as regards their order towards an end and especially their last end, which, as was said above, is the divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> (21, 4). This <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of order <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in things <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>, is itself <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Since, however, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of things by His <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and thus it behooves that the type of every effect should pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in Him, as is clear from what has gone before (19, 4), it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the type of the order of things towards their end should pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the divine mind: and the type of things ordered towards an end is, properly speaking, <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>. For it is the chief part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, to which two other parts are directed--namely, remembrance of the past, and understanding of the present; inasmuch as from the remembrance of what is past and the understanding of what is present, we gather how to provide for the future. Now it belongs to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vi, 12), to direct other things towards an end whether in regard to oneself--as for instance, a man is said to be <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>, who orders well his acts towards the end of life--or in regard to others subject to him, in a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, city or kingdom; in which sense it is said (<a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse45">Matthew 24:45</a>), "a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath appointed over his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>." In this way <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> or <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> may suitably be attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself there can be nothing ordered towards an end, since He is the last end. This type of order in things towards an end is therefore in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> called <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>. Whence <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Consol. iv, 6) that "Providence is the divine type itself, seated in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Supreme Ruler</a>; which disposeth all things": which disposition may refer either to the type of the order of things towards an end, or to the type of the order of parts in the whole.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vi, 9,10), "<a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">Prudence</a> is what, strictly speaking, commands all that 'ebulia' has rightly counselled and 'synesis' rightly judged" [Cf. I-II, 57, 6]. Whence, though to take counsel may not be fitting to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from the fact that counsel is an inquiry into matters that are <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>, nevertheless to give a command as to the ordering of things towards an end, the right reason of which He possesses, does belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa148.htm#verse6">Psalm 148:6</a>: "He hath made a decree, and it shall not pass away." In this manner both <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Although at the same time it may be said that the very reason of things to be done is called counsel in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; not because of any inquiry necessitated, but from the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, to which those who take counsel come by inquiry. Whence it is said: "Who worketh all things according to the counsel of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>" (<a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse11">Ephesians 1:11</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Two things pertain to the care of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>--namely, the "reason of order," which is called <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> and disposition; and the execution of order, which is termed government. Of these, the first is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and the second is temporal.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Providence resides in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; but presupposes the act of willing the end. Nobody gives a precept about things done for an end; unless he will that end. Hence <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> presupposes the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, by means of which the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> faculty is directed towards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says. Even if Providence has to do with the divine will and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> equally, this would not affect the divine simplicity, since in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> both the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> are one and the same thing, as we have said above (<a href="#19">Article 19</a>).

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether everything is subject to the providence of God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that everything is not subject to <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a>. For nothing foreseen can happen by chance. If then everything was foreseen by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nothing would happen by chance. And thus hazard and luck would disappear; which is against common opinion.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a wise provider excludes any defect or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as far as he can, from those over whom he has a care. But we see many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a>. Either, then, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot hinder these, and thus is not <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>; or else He does not have care for everything.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whatever happens of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> does not require <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> or <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Hence, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vi, 5,9, 10,11): "<a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">Prudence</a> is the right reason of things contingent concerning which there is counsel and choice." Since, then, many things happen from <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, everything cannot be subject to <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, whatsoever is left to itself cannot be subject to the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of a governor. But men are left to themselves by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in accordance with the words: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from the beginning, and left him in the hand of his own counsel" (<a href="../bible/sir015.htm#verse14">Sirach 15:14</a>). And particularly in reference to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>: "I let them go according to the desires of their heart" (<a href="../bible/psa080.htm#verse13">Psalm 80:13</a>). Everything, therefore, cannot be subject to <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse9">1 Corinthians 9:9</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> doth not care for oxen [Vulg. 'Doth <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> take care for oxen?']": and we may say the same of other irrational creatures. Thus everything cannot be under the care of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said of Divine Wisdom: "She reacheth from end to end mightily, and ordereth all things sweetly" (<a href="../bible/wis008.htm#verse1">Wisdom 8:1</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> totally denied the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, as Democritus and the Epicureans, maintaining that the world was made by chance. Others taught that incorruptible things only were subject to <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> and corruptible things not in their <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> selves, but only according to their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; for in this respect they are incorruptible. They are represented as saying (<a href="../bible/job022.htm#verse14">Job 22:14</a>): "The clouds are His covert; and He doth not consider our things; and He walketh about the poles of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>." <a href="../cathen/09540b.htm">Rabbi Moses</a>, however, excluded men from the generality of things corruptible, on account of the excellence of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> which they possess, but in reference to all else that suffers corruption he adhered to the opinion of the others.

<p>We must say, however, that all things are subject to <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a>, not only in general, but even in their own <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> selves. This is made evident thus. For since every agent acts for an end, the ordering of effects towards that end extends as far as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> of the first agent extends. Whence it happens that in the effects of an agent something takes place which has no reference towards the end, because the effect comes from a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> other than, and outside the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the agent. But the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is the first agent, extends to all being, not only as to constituent principles of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but also as to the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individualizing</a> principles; not only of things incorruptible, but also of things corruptible. Hence all things that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in whatsoever manner are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> directed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> towards some end; as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says: "Those things that are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are well ordered [Vulg.'Those powers that are, are ordained of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>': 'Quae autem sunt, a Deo ordinatae sunt.' <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> often quotes this passage, and invariably reads: 'Quae a Deo sunt, ordinata sunt.']" (<a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse1">Romans 13:1</a>). Since, therefore, as the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is nothing less than the type of the order of things towards an end, as we have said; it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> follows that all things, inasmuch as they participate in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, must likewise be subject to <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a>. It has also been shown (14, 6, 11) that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things, both universal and particular. And since His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> may be compared to the things themselves, as the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of art to the objects of art, all things must of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> come under His ordering; as all things wrought by art are subject to the ordering of that art.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> There is a difference between universal and particular <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. A thing can escape the order of a particular <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; but not the order of a universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. For nothing escapes the order of a particular <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, except through the intervention and hindrance of some other particular <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; as, for instance, wood may be prevented from burning, by the action of water. Since then, all particular <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> are included under the universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, it could not be that any effect should take place outside the range of that universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. So far then as an effect escapes the order of a particular <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, it is said to be casual or fortuitous in respect to that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; but if we regard the universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, outside whose range no effect can happen, it is said to be foreseen. Thus, for instance, the meeting of two servants, although to them it appears a chance circumstance, has been fully foreseen by their master, who has purposely sent to meet at the one place, in such a way that the one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not about the other.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is otherwise with one who has care of a particular thing, and one whose <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> is universal, because a particular provider excludes all defects from what is subject to his care as far as he can; whereas, one who provides universally allows some little defect to remain, lest the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the whole should be hindered. Hence, corruption and defects in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things are said to be contrary to some particular <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; yet they are in keeping with the plan of universal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; inasmuch as the defect in one thing yields to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of another, or even to the universal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: for the corruption of one is the generation of another, and through this it is that a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is kept in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. Since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then, provides universally for all being, it belongs to His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> to permit certain defects in particular effects, that the perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> may not be hindered, for if all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> were prevented, much <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> would be absent from the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. A lion would cease to live, if there were no slaying of animals; and there would be no patience of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> if there were no tyrannical <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. Thus <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion 2): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> would in no wise permit <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in His works, unless He were so almighty and so <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as to produce <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> even from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." It would appear that it was on account of these two arguments to which we have just replied, that some were persuaded to consider corruptible things--e.g. casual and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things--as removed from the care of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> is not the author of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; but he uses <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things in applying art and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to his own use. Hence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> does not reach to that which takes place in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> from <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>; but <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a> extends thus far, since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the author of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Apparently it was this argument that moved those who withdrew the course of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> from the care of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a>, attributing it rather to the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as Democritus, and others of the ancients.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> When it is said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> left <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to himself, this does not mean that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is exempt from <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a>; but merely that he has not a prefixed operating force determined to only the one effect; as in the case of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things, which are only acted upon as though directed by another towards an end; and do not act of themselves, as if they directed themselves towards an end, like rational creatures, through the possession of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, by which these are able to take counsel and make a choice. Hence it is significantly said: "In the hand of his own counsel." But since the very act of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> is traced to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as to a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> follows that everything happening from the exercise of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> must be subject to <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a>. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> is included under the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as a particular under a universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, however, extends His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> over the just in a certain more excellent way than over the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>; inasmuch as He prevents anything happening which would impede their final <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For "to them that love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, all things work together unto <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse28">Romans 8:28</a>). But from the fact that He does not restrain the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, He is said to abandon them: not that He altogether withdraws His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> from them; otherwise they would return to nothing, if they were not preserved in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> by His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>. This was the reason that had weight with Tully, who withdrew from the care of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs concerning which we take counsel.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Since a rational creature has, through its <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, control over its actions, as was said above (Question 19, Article 10), it is subject to <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a> in an especial manner, so that something is imputed to it as a fault, or as a <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>; and there is given it accordingly something by way of punishment or reward. In this way, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> withdraws oxen from the care of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: not, however, that <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> irrational creatures escape the care of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a>; as was the opinion of the <a href="../cathen/09540b.htm">Rabbi Moses</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether God has immediate providence over everything?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has not immediate <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> over all things. For whatever is contained in the notion of dignity, must be attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But it belongs to the dignity of a king, that he should have ministers; through whose mediation he provides for his subjects. Therefore much less has <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself immediate <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> over all things.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it belongs to <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> to order all things to an end. Now the end of everything is its perfection and its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But it appertains to every <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to direct its effect to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; wherefore every active <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the effect of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>. If therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> were to have immediate <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> over all things, all secondary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> would be withdrawn.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion 17) that, "It is better to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of some things than to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them, for example, vile things": and the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says the same (Metaph. xii, 51). But whatever is better must be assigned to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore He has not immediate <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> over bad and vile things.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/job034.htm#verse13">Job 34:13</a>): "What other hath He appointed over the earth? or whom hath He set over the world which He made?" On which passage <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxiv, 20): "Himself He ruleth the world which He Himself hath made."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Two things belong to <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>--namely, the type of the order of things foreordained towards an end; and the execution of this order, which is called government. As regards the first of these, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has immediate <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> over everything, because He has in His <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> the types of everything, even the smallest; and whatsoever <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> He assigns to certain effects, He gives them the power to produce those effects. Whence it must be that He has beforehand the type of those effects in His mind. As to the second, there are certain intermediaries of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>; for He governs things inferior by superior, not on account of any defect in His power, but by reason of the abundance of His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>; so that the dignity of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> is imparted even to creatures. Thus <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> opinion, as narrated by <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> (De Provid. viii, 3), is exploded. He taught a threefold <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>.

<p>First, one which belongs to the supreme Deity, Who first and foremost has provision over <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, and thus over the whole world as regards genus, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. The second <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, which is over the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> of all that can be generated and corrupted, he attributed to the divinities who circulate in the heavens; that is, certain separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, which move corporeal things in a circular direction. The third <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, over <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, he assigned to <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, whom the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> placed between us and the gods, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> tells us (De Civ. Dei, 1, 2: viii, 14).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It pertains to a king's dignity to have ministers who execute his <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>. But the fact that he has not the plan of those things which are done by them arises from a deficiency in himself. For every operative science is the more perfect, the more it considers the particular things with which its action is concerned.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> immediate provision over everything does not exclude the action of secondary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>; which are the executors of His order, as was said above (19, 5, 8).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is better for us not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> low and vile things, because by them we are impeded in our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of what is better and higher; for we cannot understand many things simultaneously; because the thought of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> sometimes perverts the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> towards <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. This does not hold with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who sees everything simultaneously at one glance, and whose will cannot turn in the direction of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether providence imposes any necessity on things foreseen?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a> imposes <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> upon things foreseen. For every effect that has a "per se" <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, either present or past, which it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> follows, happens from <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>; as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proves (Metaph. vi, 7). But the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since it is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>; and the effect flows from it of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, for <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a> cannot be frustrated. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a> imposes a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> upon things foreseen.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every provider makes his work as stable as he can, lest it should fail. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is most powerful. Therefore He assigns the stability of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> to things provided.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Consol. iv, 6): "Fate from the immutable source of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> binds together <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> and fortunes by the indissoluble connection of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>." It seems therefore that <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> imposes <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> upon things foreseen.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says that (Div. Nom. iv, 23) "to corrupt <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not the work of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>." But it is in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of some things to be <a href="../cathen/04331a.htm">contingent</a>. <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a> does not therefore impose any <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> upon things so as to destroy their contingency.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a> imposes <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> upon some things; not upon all, as some formerly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. For to <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> it belongs to order things towards an end. Now after the divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, which is an extrinsic end to all things, the principal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in things themselves is the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>; which would not be, were not all grades of being found in things. Whence it pertains to <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a> to produce every grade of being. And thus it has prepared for some things <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, so that they happen of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>; for others contingent <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, that they may happen by contingency, according to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of their proximate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The effect of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a> is not only that things should happen somehow; but that they should happen either by <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> or by contingency. Therefore whatsoever <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a> ordains to happen infallibly and of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> happens infallibly and of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>; and that happens from contingency, which the plan of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a> conceives to happen from contingency.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The order of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a> is unchangeable and certain, so far as all things foreseen happen as they have been foreseen, whether from <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> or from contingency.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> That indissolubility and unchangeableness of which <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> speaks, pertain to the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, which fails not to produce its effect, and that in the way foreseen; but they do not pertain to the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of the effects. We must remember that properly speaking "necessary" and "contingent" are consequent upon being, as such. Hence the mode both of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> and of contingency falls under the foresight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who provides universally for all being; not under the foresight of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> that provide only for some particular order of things.
