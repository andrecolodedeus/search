<h1>Question 22. The subject of the soul's passions</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2022.htm#article1"> Is there any passion in the soul?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2022.htm#article2"> Is passion in the appetitive rather than in the apprehensive part?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2022.htm#article3"> Is passion in the sensitive appetite rather than in the intellectual appetite, which is called the will?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether any passion is in the soul?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is no passion in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Because passivity belongs to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, as stated in the I, 75, 5. Therefore there is no passion in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, passion is movement, as is stated in Phys. iii, 3. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not moved, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in De Anima i, 3. Therefore passion is not in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, passion is the road to corruption; since "every <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, when increased, alters the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>," as is stated in Topic. vi, 6. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is incorruptible. Therefore no passion is in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse5">Romans 7:5</a>): "When we were in the flesh, the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which were by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, did the work in our members." Now <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are, properly speaking, in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> also, which are described as being "of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>," are in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The word "passive" is used in three ways. First, in a general way, according as whatever receives something is passive, although nothing is taken from it: thus we may say that the air is passive when it is lit up. But this is to be perfected rather than to be passive. Secondly, the word "passive" is employed in its proper sense, when something is received, while something else is taken away: and this happens in two ways. For sometimes that which is lost is unsuitable to the thing: thus when an animal's body is healed, and loses sickness. At other times the contrary occurs: thus to ail is to be passive; because the ailment is received and health is lost. And here we have passion in its most proper acceptation. For a thing is said to be passive from its being drawn to the agent: and when a thing recedes from what is suitable to it, then especially does it appear to be drawn to something else. Moreover in De Generat. i, 3 it is stated that when a more excellent thing is generated from a less excellent, we have generation simply, and corruption in a particular respect: whereas the reverse is the case, when from a more excellent thing, a less excellent is generated. In these three ways it happens that <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For in the sense of mere reception, we speak of "feeling and understanding as being a kind of passion" (De Anima i, 5). But passion, accompanied by the loss of something, is only in respect of a bodily transmutation; wherefore passion properly so called cannot be in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, save <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, in so far, to wit, as the "composite" is passive. But here again we find a difference; because when this transmutation is for the worse, it has more of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, than when it is for the better: hence sorrow is more properly a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> than <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It belongs to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to be passive in such a way as to lose something and to be transmuted: hence this happens only in those things that are composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. But passivity, as implying mere reception, need not be in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but can be in anything that is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. Now, though the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, yet it has something of <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, in respect of which it is competent to receive or to be passive, according as the act of understanding is a kind of passion, as stated in De Anima iii, 4.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although it does not belong to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in itself to be passive and to be moved, yet it belongs <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> as stated in De Anima i, 3.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of passion accompanied by transmutation to something worse. And passion, in this sense, is not found in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, except <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>: but the composite, which is corruptible, admits of it by reason of its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether passion is in the appetitive rather than in the apprehensive part?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that passion is in the apprehensive part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> rather than in the appetitive. Because that which is first in any genus, seems to rank first among all things that are in that genus, and to be their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as is stated in Metaph. ii, 1. Now passion is found to be in the apprehensive, before being in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> part: for the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> part is not affected unless there be a previous passion in the apprehensive part. Therefore passion is in the apprehensive part more than in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, what is more active is less passive; for action is contrary to passion. Now the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> part is more active than the apprehensive part. Therefore it seems that passion is more in the apprehensive part.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is the power of a corporeal organ, so is the power of sensitive apprehension. But passion in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> occurs, properly speaking, in respect of a bodily transmutation. Therefore passion is not more in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> than in the sensitive apprehensive part.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei ix, 4) that "the movement of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which the Greeks called <em>pathe</em>, are styled by some of our writers, Cicero [Those things which the Greeks call <em>pathe</em>, we prefer to call disturbances rather than diseases (Tusc. iv. 5)] for instance, disturbances; by some, affections or emotions; while others rendering the Greek more accurately, call them <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>." From this it is evident that the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are the same as affections. But affections manifestly belong to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a>, and not to the apprehensive part. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> rather than in the apprehensive part.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As we have already stated (1) the word "passion" implies that the patient is drawn to that which belongs to the agent. Now the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is drawn to a thing by the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power rather than by the apprehensive power: because the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has, through its <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, an order to things as they are in themselves: hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. vi, 4) that "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>," i.e. the objects of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, "are in things themselves." On the other hand the apprehensive power is not drawn to a thing, as it is in itself; but <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it by reason of an "<a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>" of the thing, which "<a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>" it has in itself, or receives in its own way. Hence we find it stated (Metaph. vi, 4) that "the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>," which pertain to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, "are not in things, but in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>." Consequently it is evident that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of passion is consistent with the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a>, rather than with the apprehensive part.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In things relating to perfection the case is the opposite, in comparison to things that pertain to defect. Because in things relating to perfection, intensity is in proportion to the approach to one first principle; to which the nearer a thing approaches, the more intense it is. Thus the intensity of a thing possessed of light depends on its approach to something endowed with light in a supreme degree, to which the nearer a thing approaches the more light it possesses. But in things that relate to defect, intensity depends, not on approach to something supreme, but in receding from that which is perfect; because therein consists the very notion of privation and defect. Wherefore the less a thing recedes from that which stands first, the less intense it is: and the result is that at first we always find some small defect, which afterwards increases as it goes on. Now passion pertains to defect, because it belongs to a thing according as it is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. Wherefore in those things that approach to the Supreme Perfection, i.e. to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, there is but little <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> and passion: while in other things, consequently, there is more. Hence also, in the supreme, i.e. the apprehensive, power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, passion is found less than in the other powers.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power is said to be more active, because it is, more than the apprehensive power, the principle of the exterior action: and this for the same reason that it is more passive, namely, its being related to things as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in themselves: since it is through the external action that we come into contact with things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated in the I, 78, 3 the organs of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> can be changed in two ways. First, by a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> change, in respect of which the organ receives an "<a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>" of the object. And this is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the act of the sensitive apprehension: thus is the eye changed by the object visible, not by being colored, but by receiving an <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of color. But the organs are receptive of another and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> change, which affects their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> disposition; for instance, when they become hot or cold, or undergo some similar change. And whereas this kind of change is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to the act of the sensitive apprehension; for instance, if the eye be wearied through gazing intently at something or be overcome by the intensity of the object: on the other hand, it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the act of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; wherefore the material element in the definitions of the movements of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> part, is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> change of the organ; for instance, "<a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is" said to be "a kindling of the blood about the heart." Hence it is evident that the notion of passion is more consistent with the act of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, than with that of the sensitive apprehension, although both are actions of a corporeal organ.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether passion is in the sensitive appetite rather than in the intellectual appetite, which is called the will?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that passion is not more in the sensitive than in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. For <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> declares (Div. Nom. ii) <a href="../cathen/07345b.htm">Hierotheus</a> "to be taught by a kind of yet more Godlike instruction; not only by learning Divine things, but also by suffering [patiens] them." But the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> cannot "suffer" Divine things, since its object is the sensible <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore passion is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, just as it is also in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the more powerful the active force, the more intense the passion. But the object of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, which is the universal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, is a more powerful active force than the object of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, which is a particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore passion is more consistent with the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> than with the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and love are said to be <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. But these are to be found in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and not only in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>: else they would not be ascribed by the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are not more in the sensitive than in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 22), while describing the animal <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>: "<a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> is a movement of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> when we <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: in other words, passion is a movement of the irrational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, when we think of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>) passion is properly to be found where there is corporeal transmutation. This corporeal transmutation is found in the act of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, and is not only <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, as in the sensitive apprehension, but also <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>. Now there is no need for corporeal transmutation in the act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>: because this <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is not exercised by means of a corporeal organ. It is therefore evident that passion is more properly in the act of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, than in that of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; and this is again evident from the definitions of <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> quoted above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> By "suffering" Divine things is meant being well affected towards them, and united to them by love: and this takes place without any alteration in the body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Intensity of passion depends not only on the power of the agent, but also on the passibility of the patient: because things that are disposed to passion, suffer much even from petty agents. Therefore although the object of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> has greater activity than the object of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, yet the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is more passive.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> When love and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and the like are ascribed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, or to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in respect of his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, they signify simple acts of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> having like effects, but without passion. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei ix, 5): "The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> feel no <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> while they punish . . . no fellow-feeling with misery while they relieve the unhappy: and yet ordinary <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> speech is wont to ascribe to them also these <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> by name, because, although they have none of our weakness, their acts bear a certain resemblance to ours."
