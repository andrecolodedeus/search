<h1>Question 22. Those who can excommunicate or be excommunicated</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5022.htm#article1"> Can every priest excommunicate?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5022.htm#article2"> Can one who is not a priest excommunicate?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5022.htm#article3"> Can one who is excommunicated or suspended, excommunicate?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5022.htm#article4"> Can anyone excommunicate himself, or an equal, or a superior?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5022.htm#article5"> Can a multitude be excommunicated?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5022.htm#article6"> Can one who is already excommunicated be excommunicated again?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether every priest can excommunicate?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that every <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> can <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a>. For <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> is an act of the keys. But every <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> has the keys. Therefore every <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> can <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is a greater thing to loose and bind in the tribunal of penance than in the tribunal of judgment. But every <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> can loose and bind his subjects in the tribunal of Penance. Therefore every <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> can <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> his subjects.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Matters fraught with danger should be left to the decision of superiors. Now the punishment of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> is fraught with many dangers, unless it be inflicted with moderation. Therefore it should not be entrusted to every <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In the tribunal of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> the plea is between <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whereas in the outward tribunal it is between <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Wherefore the loosing or binding of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, belongs to the tribunal of Penance, whereas the binding or loosing of a man in relation to other men, belongs to the public tribunal of external judgment. And since <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> severs a man from the communion of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, it belongs to the external tribunal. Consequently those alone can <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> who have <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in the judicial tribunal. Hence, of their own authority, only <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and higher <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, according to the more common opinion can <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a>, whereas <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> can do so only by commission or in certain cases, as those of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>, rapine and the like, in which the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> allows them to excommunicate. Others, however, have maintained that even <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> can <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a>: but the former opinion is more reasonable.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Excommunication is an act of the keys not directly, but with respect to the external judgment. The sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, however, though it is promulgated by an external verdict, still, as it belongs somewhat to the entrance to the kingdom, in so far as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Militant is the way to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Triumphant, this <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> whereby a man is competent to <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a>, can be called a key. It is in this sense that some distinguish between the key of orders, which all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> have, and the key of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in the tribunal of judgment, which none have but the judges of the external tribunal. Nevertheless <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> bestowed both on Peter (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse19">Matthew 16:19</a>), from whom they are derived by others, whichever of them they have.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Parish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> have <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> indeed over their subjects, in the tribunal of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, but not in the judicial tribunal, for they cannot summons them in contentious cases. Hence they cannot <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a>, but they can <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> them in the tribunal of Penance. And though the tribunal of Penance is higher, yet more <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> is requisite in the judicial tribunal, because therein it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to make satisfaction not only to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> but also to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether those who are not priests can excommunicate?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that those who are not <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> cannot excommunicate. Because <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> is an act of the keys, as stated in Sent. iv, D, 18. But those who are not <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> have not the keys. Therefore they cannot <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, more is required for <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> than for <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> in the tribunal of Penance. But one who is not a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> in the tribunal of Penance. Neither therefore can he <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Archdeacons, legates and bishops-elect <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a>, and yet sometimes they are not <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Therefore not only <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> can <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Priests alone are competent to dispense the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> wherein <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is given: wherefore they alone can loose and bind in the tribunal of Penance. On the other hand <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> regards <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, not directly but consequently, in so far as it deprives a man of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, by which he is disposed for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> or preserved therein. Consequently even those who are not <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, provided they have <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in a contentious court, can <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Though they have not the key of orders, they have the key of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> These two are related to one another as something exceeding and something exceeded [Cf. 1, a2; 24, 1, ad 1, and consequently one of them may be within the competency of someone while the other is not.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether a man who is excommunicated or suspended can excommunicate another?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one who is <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> or suspended can <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> another. For such a one has lost neither orders nor <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, since neither is he ordained anew when he is <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a>, nor is his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> renewed. But <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> requires nothing more than orders or <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Therefore even one who is <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> or suspended can <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further. it is a greater thing to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> than to <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a>. But such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> can <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a>. Therefore they can <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> one whose body is bound cannot bind another. But <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> gyves are stronger than bodily fetters. Therefore one who is <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> another, since <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> chain.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Jurisdiction can only be used in relation to another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Consequently, since every <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is severed from the communion of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, he is deprived of the use of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. And as <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> requires <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, an <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a>, and the same reason applies to one who is suspended from <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. For if he be suspended from orders only, then he cannot exercise his order, but he can use his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, while, on the other hand, if he be suspended from <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> and not from orders. he cannot use his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, though he can exercise his order: and if he be suspended from both, he can exercise neither.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although an <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> or suspended <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> does not lose his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, yet he does lose its use.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The power of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> results from the power of the character which is indelible, wherefore, from the very fact that a man has the character of order, he can always <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a>, though not always lawfully. It is different with the power of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> which results from <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, for this can be taken away and bound.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether a man can excommunicate himself, his equal, or his superior?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a man can <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> himself, his equal, or his superior. For an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was greater than <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse11">Matthew 11:11</a>: "He that is lesser in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is greater then he, a greater" than whom "hath not risen among men that are born of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> (<a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse8">Galatians 1:8</a>). Therefore a man can <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> his superior.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, sometimes a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> pronounces a general <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> for <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> or the like. But it might happen that he, or his equal, or a superior has done such things. Therefore a man can <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> himself, his equal, or a superior.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a man can <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> his superior or his equal in the tribunal of Penance, as when a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> confesses to his subject, or one <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> confesses venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to another. Therefore it seems that a man may also <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> his superior, or his equal.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Excommunication is an act of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. But no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over himself (since one cannot be both judge and defendant in the same trial), or over his superior, or over an equal. Therefore a man cannot <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> his superior, or his equal, or himself.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since, by <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, a man is placed above those over whom he has <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, through being their judge, it follows that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over himself, his superior, or his equal, and that, consequently, no one can <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> either himself, or his superior, or his equal.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> is speaking hypothetically, i.e. supposing an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> were to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for in that case he would not be higher than the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>, but lower. Nor is it absurd that, if the antecedent of a conditional sentence be impossible, the consequence be impossible also.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In that case no one would be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, since no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has power over his peer.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Loosing and binding in the tribunal of confession affects our relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> only, in Whose sight a man from being above another sinks below him through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; while on the other hand <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> is the affair of an external tribunal in which a man does not forfeit his superiority on account of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Hence there is no comparison between the two tribunals. Nevertheless, even in the tribunal of confession, a man cannot <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> himself, or his superior, or his equal, unless the power to do so be committed to him. This does not apply to venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, because they can be remitted through any <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which confer <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, hence remission of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> follows the power of orders.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether a sentence of excommunication can be passed on a body of men?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> can be passed on a body of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Because it is possible for a number of people to be united together in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. Now when a man is obstinate in his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> he should be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. Therefore a body of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> can be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the most grievous effect of an <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> is privation of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But sometimes a whole country is laid under an interdict. Therefore a body of people can be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [Cf. Ep. ccl] on <a href="../bible/mat012.htm">Matthew 12</a> asserts that the sovereign and a body of people cannot be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> except for a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> consists in an act: and acts do not belong to communities, but, generally speaking, to <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> members of a community can be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, but not the community itself. And although sometimes an act belongs to a whole multitude, as when many draw a boat, which none of them could draw by himself, yet it is not probable that a community would so wholly consent to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that there would be no dissentients. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who judges all the earth, does not condemn the just with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> (<a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse25">Genesis 18:25</a>). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who should imitate the judgments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, prudently decided that a community should not be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, lest the wheat be uprooted together with the tares and cockle.

<p>The Reply to the First Objection is evident from what has been said.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Suspension is not so great a punishment as <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, since those who are suspended are not deprived of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> are. Wherefore a man can be suspended without having committed a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> himself, just as a whole kingdom is laid under an interdict on account of the king's crime. Hence there is no comparison between <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> and suspension.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether a man can be excommunicated who is already under sentence of excommunication?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a man who is already under sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> any further. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 5:12</a>): "What have I to do to judge them that are without?" Now those who are <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> are already outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> cannot exercise any further judgment on them, so as to <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> them again.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> is privation of divine things and of the communion of the faithful. But when a man has been deprived of a thing, he cannot be deprived of it again. Therefore one who is <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> again

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Excommunication is a punishment and a healing medicine. Now punishments and medicines are repeated when <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> can be repeated.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who is under sentence of one <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, can be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> again, either by a repetition of the same <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, for his greater confusion, so that he may renounce <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or for some other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. And then there are as many principal excommunications, as there are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> for his being <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> is speaking of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> and of other unbelievers who have no (sacramental) character, whereby they are numbered among the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But since the baptismal character whereby a man is numbered among <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> people, is indelible, one who is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> always belongs to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in some way, so that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is always competent to sit in judgment on him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although privation does not receive more or less in itself, yet it can, as regards its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. In this way an <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> can be repeated, and a man who has been <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> several times is further from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> than one who has been <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> only once.
