<h1>Question 23. Adoption as befitting to Christ</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/4023.htm#article1"> Is it fitting that God should adopt sons?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4023.htm#article2"> Is this fitting to God the Father alone?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4023.htm#article3"> Is it proper to man to be adopted to the sonship of God?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4023.htm#article4"> Can Christ be called the adopted Son?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether it is fitting that God should adopt sons?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is not fitting that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should adopt sons. For, as jurists say, no one adopts anyone but a stranger as his son. But no one is a stranger in relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a> of all. Therefore it seems unfitting that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should adopt.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, adoption seems to have been introduced in default of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> sonship. But in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> sonship, as set down in the I, 27, 2. Therefore it is unfitting that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should adopt.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the purpose of adopting anyone is that he may succeed, as heir, the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who adopts him. But it does not seem possible for anyone to succeed <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as heir, for He can never die. Therefore it is unfitting that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should adopt.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse5">Ephesians 1:5</a>) that "He hath <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> us unto the adoption of children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not ineffectual. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does adopt some as His sons.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> adopts someone as his son forasmuch as out of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> he admits him as heir to his estate. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: for which reason He admits His creatures to a participation of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things; especially rational creatures, who forasmuch as they are made to the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are capable of Divine beatitude. And this consists in the enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by which also <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> and rich in Himself--that is, in the enjoyment of Himself. Now a man's inheritance is that which makes him rich. Wherefore, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, admits men to the inheritance of beatitude, He is said to adopt them. Moreover Divine exceeds <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> adoption, forasmuch as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by bestowing His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, makes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whom He adopts worthy to receive the heavenly inheritance; whereas <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not make him worthy whom he adopts; but rather in adopting him he chooses one who is already worthy.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Considered in his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not a stranger in respect to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> bestowed on him: but he is as to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; in regard to which he is adopted.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Man works in order to supply his wants: not so <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who works in order to communicate to others the abundance of His perfection. Wherefore, as by the work of creation the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is communicated to all creatures in a certain likeness, so by the work of adoption the likeness of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> sonship is communicated to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse29">Romans 8:29</a>: "Whom He foreknew . . . to be made conformable to the image of His Son."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Spiritual goods can be possessed by many at the same time; not so material goods. Wherefore none can receive a material inheritance except the successor of a deceased <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>: whereas all receive the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> inheritance at the same time in its entirety without detriment to the ever-living Father.

<p>Yet it might be said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> ceases to be, according as He is in us by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so as to begin to be in us by vision, as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says on <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse17">Romans 8:17</a>: "If sons, heirs also."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether it is fitting that the whole Trinity should adopt?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem unfitting that the whole <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> should adopt. For adoption is said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in likeness to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> custom. But among men those only adopt who can beget: and in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> this can be applied only to the Father. Therefore in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father alone can adopt.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, by adoption men become the brethren of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse29">Romans 8:29</a>: "That He might be the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> among many brethren." Now brethren are the sons of the same father; wherefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> says (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse17">John 20:17</a>): "I <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascend</a> to My Father and to your Father." Therefore Christ's Father alone has adopted sons.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse4">Galatians 4:4-6</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent His Son . . . that we might receive the adoption of sons. And because you are sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath sent the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of His Son into your hearts, crying: '<a href="../cathen/01006d.htm">Abba</a>' [Father]." Therefore it belongs to Him to adopt, Who has the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. But this belongs to the Father alone. Therefore it befits the Father alone to adopt.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It belongs to Him to adopt us as sons, Whom we can call Father; whence it is written (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse15">Romans 8:15</a>): "You have received the spirit of adoption of sons, whereby we cry: '<a href="../cathen/01006d.htm">Abba</a>' [Father]." But when we say to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, "Our Father," we address the whole <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>: as is the case with the other names which are said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in respect of creatures, as stated in I, 33, 3, Objection 1; cf. I, 45, 6. Therefore to adopt is befitting to the whole <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There is this difference between an adopted son of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, that the latter is "begotten not made"; whereas the former is made, according to <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse12">John 1:12</a>: "He gave them power to be made the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Yet sometimes the adopted son is said to be begotten, by reason of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> regeneration which is by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, not by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse18">James 1:18</a>): "Of His own will hath He begotten us by the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." Now although, in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to beget belongs to the Person of the Father, yet to produce any effect in creatures is common to the whole <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, by reason of the oneness of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>: since, where there is one <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, there must needs be one power and one operation: whence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> says (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse19">John 5:19</a>): "What things soever the Father doth, these the Son also doth in like manner." Therefore it belongs to the whole <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> to adopt men as sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> All <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> are not of one <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, so that there need be one operation and one effect of them all, as is the case in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Consequently in this respect no comparison is possible.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> By adoption we are made the brethren of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as having with Him the same Father: Who, nevertheless, is His Father in one way, and ours in another. Whence pointedly <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> says, separately, "My Father," and "Your Father" (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse17">John 20:17</a>). For He is Christ's Father by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> generation; and this is proper to Him: whereas He is our Father by a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> operation, which is common to Him and to the Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: so that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not the Son of the whole <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, as we are.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (1, ad 2), adoptive sonship is a certain likeness of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Sonship: just as all that takes place in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> is a certain likeness of what has been from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is likened to the splendor of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">Eternal</a> Son by reason of the light of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which is attributed to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Therefore adoption, though common to the whole <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, is appropriated to the Father as its author; to the Son, as its exemplar; to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as imprinting on us the likeness of this exemplar.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether it is proper to the rational nature to be adopted?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is not proper to the rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to be adopted. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not said to be the Father of the rational creature, save by adoption. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is called the Father even of the irrational creature, according to <a href="../bible/job038.htm#verse28">Job 38:28</a>: "Who is father of the rain? Or who begot the drops of dew?" Therefore it is not proper to the rational creature to be adopted.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, by reason of adoption some are called sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But to be sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> seems to be properly attributed by the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; according to <a href="../bible/job001.htm#verse6">Job 1:6</a>: "On a certain day when the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> came to stand before the Lord." Therefore it is not proper to the rational creature to be adopted.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whatever is proper to a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, belongs to all that have that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: just as risibility belongs to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. But to be adopted does not belong to every rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore it is not proper to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Adopted sons are the "heirs of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," as is stated <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse17">Romans 8:17</a>. But such an inheritance belongs to none but the rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore it is proper to the rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to be adopted.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (2, ad 3), the sonship of adoption is a certain likeness of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> sonship. Now the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> proceeds <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> from the Father as <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">Intellectual</a> Word, in oneness of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> with the Father. To this Word, therefore, something may be likened in three ways. First, on the part of the form but not on the part of its intelligibility: thus the form of a house already built is like the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> word of the builder in its specific form, but not in intelligibility, because the material form of a house is not intelligible, as it was in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the builder. In this way every creature is like the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">Eternal</a> Word; since it was made through the Word. Secondly, the creature is likened to the Word, not only as to its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, but also as to its intelligibility: thus the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which is begotten in the disciple's mind is likened to the word in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the master. In this way the rational creature, even in its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, is likened to the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>. Thirdly, a creature is likened to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">Eternal</a> Word, as to the oneness of the Word with the Father, which is by reason of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: wherefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> (<a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse21">John 17:21-22</a>): "That they may be one in Us . . . as We also are one." And this likeness perfects the adoption: for to those who are thus like Him the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> inheritance is due. It is therefore clear that to be adopted belongs to the rational creature alone: not indeed to all, but only to those who have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; which is "poured forth in our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans 5:5</a>); for which reason (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse15">Romans 8:15</a>) the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is called "the Spirit of adoption of sons."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is called the Father of the irrational creature, not properly speaking, by reason of adoption, but by reason of creation; according to the first-mentioned participation of likeness.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Angels are called sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by adoptive sonship, not that it belongs to them first; but because they were the first to receive the adoption of sons.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Adoption is a property resulting not from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but from <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, of which the rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is capable. Therefore it need not belong to every rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: but every rational creature must needs be capable of adoption.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether Christ as man is the adopted Son of God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is the adopted <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. For <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (De Trin. ii) speaking of Christ: "The dignity of power is not forfeited when carnal humanity [Some editions read 'humilitas'--'the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> or lowliness of the flesh'] is adopted." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is the adopted <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Praedest. Sanct. xv) that "by the same <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that Man is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as from the birth of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>." But other men are <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of adoption. Therefore this Man is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by adoption: and consequently He would seem to be an adopted son.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, is a servant. But it is of greater dignity to be an adopted son than to be a servant. Therefore much more is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, an adopted Son.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Incarn. viii): "We do not call an adopted son a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> son: the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> son is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> son." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1jo005.htm#verse20">1 John 5:20</a>: "That we may . . . be in His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Son, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as Man, is not an adopted Son.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Sonship belongs properly to the hypostasis or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, not to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; whence in I, 32, 3 we have stated that Filiation is a personal property. Now in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there is no other than the uncreated <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> or hypostasis, to Whom it belongs by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. But it has been said above (1, ad 2), that the sonship of adoption is a participated likeness of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> sonship: nor can a thing be said to participate in what it has <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, can nowise be called an adopted Son.

<p>But according to those who suppose two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> or two hypostases or two supposita in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, no reason prevents <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> being called the adopted <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As sonship does not properly belong to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, so neither does adoption. Consequently, when it is said that "carnal humanity is adopted," the expression is metaphorical: and adoption is used to signify the union of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to the Person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This comparison of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is to be referred to the principle because, to wit, just as it is granted to any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> without meriting it to be a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, so did it happen that this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> without meriting it was <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But there is a difference on the part of the term: because by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of union <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> Son; whereas another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is an adopted son. Yet <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> does not make one who was not a son to be an adopted son, but is a certain effect of Filiation in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John 1:14</a>: "We saw His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> . . . as it were of the Only-begotten of the Father; full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> To be a creature, as also to be subservient or subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, regards not only the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, but also the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: but this cannot be said of sonship. Wherefore the comparison does not hold.
