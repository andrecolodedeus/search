<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether charity is friendship?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not friendship. For nothing is so appropriate to friendship as to dwell with one's friend, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. viii, 5). Now <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, "whose dwelling [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'conversation'] is not with men" (<a href="../bible/dan002.htm#verse11">Daniel 2:11</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not friendship.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, there is no friendship without return of love (Ethic. viii, 2). But <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> extends even to one's enemies, according to <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse44">Matthew 5:44</a>: "Love your enemies." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not friendship.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. viii, 3) there are three kinds of friendship, directed respectively towards the delightful, the useful, or the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not the friendship for the useful or delightful; for <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says in his letter to Paulinus which is to be found at the beginning of the Bible: "True friendship cemented by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, is where men are drawn together, not by household interests, not by mere bodily presence, not by crafty and cajoling flattery, but by the fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the study of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Divine Scriptures</a>." No more is it friendship for the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, since by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> we love even sinners, whereas friendship based on the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> is only for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> men (Ethic. viii). Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not friendship.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse15">John 15:15</a>): "I will not now call you servants . . . but My friends." Now this was said to them by reason of nothing else than <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is friendship.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. viii, 2,3) not every love has the character of friendship, but that love which is together with benevolence, when, to wit, we love someone so as to wish <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to him. If, however, we do not wish <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to what we love, but wish its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for ourselves, (thus we are said to love wine, or a horse, or the like), it is love not of friendship, but of a kind of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. For it would be absurd to speak of having friendship for wine or for a horse.

<p>Yet neither does well-wishing suffice for friendship, for a certain mutual love is requisite, since friendship is between friend and friend: and this well-wishing is founded on some kind of communication.

<p>Accordingly, since there is a communication between <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, inasmuch as He communicates His <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> to us, some kind of friendship must needs be based on this same communication, of which it is written (<a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse9">1 Corinthians 1:9</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is faithful: by Whom you are called unto the fellowship of His Son." The love which is based on this communication, is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: wherefore it is evident that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is the friendship of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man's</a> life is twofold. There is his outward life in respect of his sensitive and corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: and with regard to this life there is no communication or fellowship between us and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. The other is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life in respect of his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and with regard to this life there is fellowship between us and both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, imperfectly indeed in this present state of life, wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse20">Philippians 3:20</a>): "Our conversation is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>." But this "conversation" will be perfected in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, when "His servants shall serve Him, and they shall see His face" (<a href="../bible/rev022.htm#verse3">Apocalypse 22:3-4</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is imperfect here, but will be perfected in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Friendship extends to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in two ways: first in respect of himself, and in this way friendship never extends but to one's friends: secondly, it extends to someone in respect of another, as, when a man has friendship for a certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, for his sake he loves all belonging to him, be they children, servants, or connected with him in any way. Ondeed so much do we love our friends, that for their sake we love all who belong to them, even if they hurt or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> us; so that, in this way, the friendship of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> extends even to our enemies, whom we love out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> in relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to Whom the friendship of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is chiefly directed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The friendship that is based on the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> is directed to none but a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as the principal <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, but for his sake we love those who belong to him, even though they be not <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>: in this way <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which above all is friendship based on the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, extends to sinners, whom, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, we love for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether charity is something created in the soul?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not something <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. viii, 7): "He that loveth his neighbor, consequently, loveth love itself." Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is love. Therefore it follows that he loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the first place. Again he says (De Trin. xv, 17): "It was said: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a>, even as it was said: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a Spirit." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not something <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the life of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> spiritually just as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the life of the body, according to <a href="../bible/deu030.htm#verse20">Deuteronomy 30:20</a>: "He is thy life." Now the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by itself quickens the body. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> quickens the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by Himself. But He quickens it by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse14">1 John 3:14</a>: "We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> itself.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> thing is of <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power; on the contrary every creature is vanity. But <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not vanity, indeed it is opposed to vanity; and it is of <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power, since it brings the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not something <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. iii, 10): "By <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> I mean the movement of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> towards the enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for His own sake." But a movement of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is something <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is something <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> looks thoroughly into this question in 17 of the First Book, and concludes that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not something <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> Himself dwelling in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. Nor does he mean to say that this movement of love whereby we love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> Himself, but that this movement is from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> without any intermediary <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, whereas other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> acts are from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> by means of the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, for instance the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or hope or of some other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: and this he said on account of the excellence of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p>But if we consider the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> aright, this would be, on the contrary, detrimental to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For when the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> moves the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind the movement of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> does not proceed from this motion in such a way that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind be merely moved, without being the principle of this movement, as when a body is moved by some extrinsic motive power. For this is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> act, whose principle needs to be in itself, as stated above (I-II, 6, 1): so that it would follow that to love is not a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> act, which involves a contradiction, since love, of its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, implies an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p>Likewise, neither can it be said that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> moves the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in such a way to the act of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a>, as though the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> were an instrument, for an instrument, though it be a principle of action, nevertheless has not the power to act or not to act, for then again the act would cease to be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> and <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>, whereas it has been stated above (I-II, 114, 4) that the love of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is the root of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>: and, given that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is moved by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> to the act of love, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> also should be the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of that act.

<p>Now no act is perfectly produced by an active power, unless it be connatural to that power of reason of some form which is the principle of that action. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who moves all things to their due ends, bestowed on each thing the form whereby it is inclined to the end appointed to it by Him; and in this way He "ordereth all things sweetly" (<a href="../bible/wis008.htm#verse1">Wisdom 8:1</a>). But it is evident that the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> surpasses the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the power of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, so that, therefore, unless some form be superadded to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power, inclining it to the act of love, this same act would be less perfect than the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> acts and the acts of the other powers; nor would it be easy and pleasurable to perform. And this is evidently <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>, since no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> has such a strong inclination to its act as <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> has, nor does any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> perform its act with so great pleasure. Therefore it is most <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that, for us to perform the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, there should be in us some <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> form superadded to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power, inclining that power to the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> it to act with ease and pleasure.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The Divine Essence Itself is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, even as It is wisdom and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Wherefore just as we are said to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> with the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and wise with the wisdom which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (since the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> whereby we are formally <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is a participation of Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, and the wisdom whereby we are formally wise, is a share of Divine wisdom), so too, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> whereby formally we love our neighbor is a participation of Divine <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For this manner of speaking is common among the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a>, with whose doctrines <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> was imbued; and the lack of adverting to this has been to some an occasion of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is effectively the life both of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and of the body by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: but formally <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is the life of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, even as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the life of the body. Consequently we may conclude from this that just as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is immediately united to the body, so is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> works formally. Now the efficacy of a form depends on the power of the agent, who instills the form, wherefore it is evident that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not vanity. But because it produces an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> effect, since, by justifying the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, it unites it to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, this proves the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> of the Divine power, which is the author of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether charity is a virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is a kind of friendship. Now <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> do not reckon friendship a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as may be gathered from Ethic. viii, 1; nor is it numbered among the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> whether moral or <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>. Neither, therefore, is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is the ultimate limit of power" (De Coelo et Mundo i, 11). But <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not something ultimate, this applies rather to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and peace. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and that this should be said rather of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and peace.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. But <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, since it is a more excellent thing than the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself: whereas no <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> is more excellent than its subject. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Moribus Eccl. xi): "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which, when our affections are perfectly ordered, unites us to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for by it we love Him."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Human</a> acts are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> according as they are regulated by their due rule and measure. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which is the principle of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> acts consists in following the rule of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, which is twofold, as stated above (Question 17, Article 1), viz. <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>Consequently just as moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is defined as being "in accord with right reason," as stated in Ethic. ii, 6, so too, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> consists in attaining <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as also stated above with regard to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, (4, 5) and hope (17, 1). Wherefore, it follows that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, for, since <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> attains <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it unites us to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as evidenced by the authority of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> quoted above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. viii) does not deny that friendship is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but affirms that it is "either a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> or with a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>." For we might say that it is a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> about works done in respect of another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, but under a different aspect from <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is about works done in respect of another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, under the aspect of the legal due, whereas friendship considers the aspect of a friendly and moral <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, or rather that of a gratuitous favor, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> explains (Ethic. viii, 13). Nevertheless it may be admitted that it is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> distinct of itself from the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For its praiseworthiness and virtuousness are derived merely from its object, in so far, to wit, as it is based on the moral <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. This is evident from the fact that not every friendship is praiseworthy and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, as in the case of friendship based on pleasure or utility. Wherefore friendship for the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> is something consequent to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> rather than a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Moreover there is no comparison with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> since it is not founded principally on the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of a man, but on the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It belongs to the same <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to love a man and to rejoice about him, since <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> results from love, as stated above (I-II, 25, 2) in the treatise on the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>: wherefore love is reckoned a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, rather than <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, which is an effect of love. And when <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is described as being something ultimate, we mean that it is last, not in the order of effect, but in the order of excess, just as one hundred pounds exceed sixty.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Every <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> is inferior to <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> if we consider its being, since <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> has being in itself, while an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> has its being in another: but considered as to its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> which results from the principles of its subject is inferior to its subject, even as an effect is inferior to its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; whereas an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> that results from a participation of some higher <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is superior to its subject, in so far as it is a likeness of that higher <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, even as light is superior to the diaphanous body. On this way <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is superior to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in as much as it is a participation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether charity is a special virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says: "Let me briefly define all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> as the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> whereby we love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" [The reference should be to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, Ep. clxvii]: and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Moribus Eccl. xv) [De Civ. Dei xv, 22 that "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is the order of love." Now no special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is included in the definition of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in general. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which extends to all works of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, cannot be a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> extends to all works of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse4">1 Corinthians 13:4</a>: "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> is patient, is kind," etc.; indeed it extends to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions, according to <a href="../bible/1co016.htm#verse14">1 Corinthians 16:14</a>: "Let all your things be done in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> refer to acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Perfect. Human. Justit. v) that, "Thou shalt love" is "a general commandment," and "Thou shalt not covet," "a general prohibition." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is a general <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Nothing general is enumerated together with what is special. But <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is enumerated together with special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, viz. hope and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse13">1 Corinthians 13:13</a>: "And now there remain <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, these three." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Acts and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are specified by their objects, as shown above (I-II, 18, 2; I-II, 54, 2). Now the proper object of love is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as stated above (I-II, 27, 1), so that wherever there is a special aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, there is a special kind of love. But the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, inasmuch as it is the object of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, has a special aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, wherefore the love of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which is the love of that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, is a special kind of love. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> is included in the definition of every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, not as being <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but because every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> depends on it in a way, as we shall state further on (A7,8). On this way <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is included in the definition of the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as explained in Ethic. ii, vi, from the fact that they depend on <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> or art which is concerned about the last end, commands the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> or arts which are concerned about other ends which are secondary, thus the military art commands the art of horse-riding (Ethic. i). Accordingly since <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> has for its object the last end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, viz. everlasting <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, it follows that it extends to the acts of a man's whole life, by commanding them, not by eliciting immediately all acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The precept of love is said to be a general command, because all other precepts are reduced thereto as to their end, according to <a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse5">1 Timothy 1:5</a>: "The end of the commandment is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>."

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether charity is one virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are distinct according to their objects. Now there are two objects of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>--<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and our neighbor--which are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> distant from one another. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, different aspects of the object diversify a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, even though that object be one in reality, as shown above (17, 6; I-II, 54, 2, ad 1). Now there are many aspects under which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is an object of love, because we are debtors to His love by reason of each one of His favors. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> comprises friendship for our neighbor. But the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> reckons several <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of friendship (Ethic. viii, 3,11,12). Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but is divided into a number of various <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Just as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so is He the object of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> by reason of the unity of the Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, according to <a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse5">Ephesians 4:5</a>: "One <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> also is one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> by reason of the unity of the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>) is a kind of friendship of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now the different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of friendship are differentiated, first of all, in respect of a diversity of end, and in this way there are three <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of friendship, namely friendship for the useful, for the delightful, and for the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>; secondly, in respect of the different kinds of communion on which friendships are based; thus there is one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of friendship between kinsmen, and another between fellow citizens or fellow travellers, the former being based on <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> communion, the latter on civil communion or on the comradeship of the road, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> explains (Ethic. viii, 12).

<p>Now <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> cannot be differentiated in either of these ways: for its end is one, namely, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and the fellowship of everlasting <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, on which this friendship is based, is also one. Hence it follows that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is simply one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and not divided into several <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument would hold, if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and our neighbor were equally objects of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. But this is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the principal object of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, while our neighbor is loved out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is loved by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> for His own sake: wherefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> regards principally but one aspect of lovableness, namely <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, which is His <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa105.htm#verse1">Psalm 105:1</a>: "Give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the Lord for He is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." Other reasons that inspire us with love for Him, or which make it our <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to love Him, are secondary and result from the first.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Human</a> friendship of which the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> treats has various ends and various forms of fellowship. This does not apply to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as stated above: wherefore the comparison fails.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether charity is the most excellent of the virtues?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not the most excellent of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Because the higher power has the higher <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> even as it has a higher operation. Now the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is higher than the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, since it directs the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, is more excellent than <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> which is in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the thing by which another works seems the less excellent of the two, even as a servant, by whom his master works, is beneath his master. Now "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> . . . worketh by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>," according to <a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse6">Galatians 5:6</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is more excellent than <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that which is by way of addition to another seems to be the more perfect of the two. Now hope seems to be something additional to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: for the object of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, whereas the object of hope is an arduous <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore hope is more excellent than <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse13">1 Corinthians 13:13</a>): "The greater of these is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, depends on their being regulated by the due rule, it must needs be that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which is a principle of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> acts, consists in attaining the rule of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>. Now the rule of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> is twofold, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), namely, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: yet <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the first rule, whereby, even <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> must be regulated. Consequently the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, which consist in attaining this first rule, since their object is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are more excellent than the moral, or the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, which consist in attaining <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>: and it follows that among the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> themselves, the first place belongs to that which attains <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> most.

<p>Now that which is of itself always ranks before that which is by another. But <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope attain <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> indeed in so far as we derive from Him the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> or the acquisition of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, whereas <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> attains <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself that it may rest in Him, but not that something may accrue to us from Him. Hence <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is more excellent than <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or hope, and, consequently, than all the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, just as <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, which by itself attains reason, is more excellent than the other moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, which attain reason in so far as it appoints the mean in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> operations or <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The operation of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is completed by the thing understood being in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> subject, so that the excellence of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> operation is assessed according to the measure of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. On the other hand, the operation of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and of every <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power is completed in the tendency of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> towards a thing as its term, wherefore the excellence of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> operation is gauged according to the thing which is the object of the operation. Now those things which are beneath the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are more excellent in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> than they are in themselves, because a thing is contained according to the mode of the container (De Causis xii). On the other hand, things that are above the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, are more excellent in themselves than they are in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Consequently it is better to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> than to love the things that are beneath us; for which reason the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> gave the preference to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> over the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> (Ethic. x, 7,8): whereas the love of the things that are above us, especially of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, ranks before the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of such things. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is more excellent than <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> works by love, not instrumentally, as a master by his servant, but as by its proper form: hence the argument does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The same <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is the object of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and of hope: but <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> implies union with that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, whereas hope implies distance therefrom. Hence <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> does not regard that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as being arduous, as hope does, since what is already united has not the character of arduous: and this shows that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is more perfect than hope.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether any true virtue is possible without charity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there can be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For it is proper to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to produce a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> act. Now those who have not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, do some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> actions, as when they clothe the naked, or feed the hungry and so forth. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is possible without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not possible without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, since it comes of "an unfeigned <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>," as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse5">1 Timothy 1:5</a>). Now, in unbelievers, there can be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, if they curb their <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, if they judge rightly. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is possible without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, science and art are <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, according to Ethic. vi. But they are to be found in sinners who lack <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> can be without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse3">1 Corinthians 13:3</a>): "If I should distribute all my goods to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and if I should deliver my body to be burned, and have not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, it profiteth me nothing." And yet <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is very profitable, according to <a href="../bible/wis008.htm#verse7">Wisdom 8:7</a>: "She teacheth <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, which are such things as men can have nothing more profitable in life." Therefore no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is possible without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Virtue is ordered to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as stated above (I-II, 55, 4). Now the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is chiefly an end, for things directed to the end are not said to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> except in relation to the end. Accordingly, just as the end is twofold, the last end, and the proximate end, so also, is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> twofold, one, the ultimate and universal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, the other proximate and particular. The ultimate and principal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is the enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa072.htm#verse28">Psalm 72:28</a>: "It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for me to adhere to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," and to this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is ordered by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Man's secondary and, as it were, particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> may be twofold: one is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, because, considered in itself, it can be directed to the principal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is the last end; while the other is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> apparently and not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, because it leads us away from the final <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Accordingly it is evident that simply <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is that which is directed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> principal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; thus also the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Phys. vii, text. 17) that "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is the disposition of a perfect thing to that which is best": and in this way no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is possible without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p>If, however, we take <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> as being ordered to some particular end, then we speak of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> being where there is no <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, in so far as it is directed to some particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But if this particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but an apparent <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it is not a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that is ordered to such a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but a counterfeit <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Even so, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Julian. iv, 3), "the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of the miser, whereby he devises various roads to gain, is no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; nor the miser's <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, whereby he scorns the property of another through fear of severe punishment; nor the miser's <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, whereby he curbs his desire for expensive pleasures; nor the miser's <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, whereby as Horace, says, 'he braves the sea, he crosses mountains, he goes through fire, in order to avoid <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>'" (Epis. lib, 1; Ep. i, 45). If, on the other hand, this particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> be a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, for instance the welfare of the state, or the like, it will indeed be a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, imperfect, however, unless it be referred to the final and perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Accordingly no strictly <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is possible without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The act of one lacking <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> may be of two kinds; one is in accordance with his lack of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as when he does something that is referred to that whereby he lacks <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Such an act is always <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: thus <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Julian. iv, 3) that the actions which an unbeliever performs as an unbeliever, are always <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, even when he clothes the naked, or does any like thing, and directs it to his unbelief as end.

<p>There is, however, another act of one lacking <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, not in accordance with his lack of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, but in accordance with his possession of some other <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whether <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or hope, or even his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is not completely taken away by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated above (10, 4; I-II, 85, 2). On this way it is possible for an act, without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, to be generically <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but not perfectly <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, because it lacks its due order to the last end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Since the end is in practical matters, what the principle is in speculative matters, just as there can be no strictly <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> science, if a right estimate of the first indemonstrable principle be lacking, so, there can be no strictly <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, or <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, without that due ordering to the end, which is effected by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, however rightly a man may be affected about other matters.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Science and art of their very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> imply a relation to some particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and not to the ultimate <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, as do the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, which make <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> simply, as stated above (I-II, 56, 3). Hence the comparison fails.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether charity is the form of the virtues?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> form of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Because the form of a thing is either exemplar or <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not the exemplar form of the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, since it would follow that the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> as <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: nor is it the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> form of the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, since then it would not be distinct from them. Therefore it is in no way the form of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is compared to the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> as their root and foundation, according to <a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse17">Ephesians 3:17</a>: "Rooted and founded in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>." Now a root or foundation is not the form, but rather the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of a thing, since it is the first part in the making. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not the form of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, formal, final, and efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> do not coincide with one another (Phys. ii, 7). Now <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is called the end and the mother of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Therefore it should not be called their form.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> [Lombard, Sent. iii, D, 23 says that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is the form of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In morals the form of an act is taken chiefly from the end. The reason of this is that the principal of moral acts is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, whose object and form, so to speak, are the end. Now the form of an act always follows from a form of the agent. Consequently, in morals, that which gives an act its order to the end, must needs give the act its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Now it is evident, in accordance with what has been said (7), that it is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> which directs the acts of all other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> to the last end, and which, consequently, also gives the form to all other acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: and it is precisely in this sense that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is called the form of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, for these are called <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in relation to "informed" acts.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> is called the form of the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> not as being their exemplar or their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> form, but rather by way of efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, in so far as it sets the form on all, in the aforesaid manner.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> is compared to the foundation or root in so far as all other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> draw their sustenance and nourishment therefrom, and not in the sense that the foundation and root have the character of a material <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> is said to be the end of other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, because it directs all other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> to its own end. And since a mother is one who conceives within herself and by another, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is called the mother of the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, because, by commanding them, it conceives the acts of the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, by the desire of the last end.
