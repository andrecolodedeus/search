<h1>Question 23. Communication with excommunicated persons</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5023.htm#article1"> Is it lawful to communicate in matters purely corporal with one who is excommunicated?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5023.htm#article2"> Is one who communicates with an excommunicated person excommunicated?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5023.htm#article3"> Is it always a mortal sin to communicate with an excommunicated person in matters not permitted by law?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether it is lawful, in matters purely corporal, to communicate with an excommunicated person?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is lawful, in matters purely corporal, to communicate with an <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. For <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> is an act of the keys. But the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> extends only to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> matters. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> does not prevent one from communicating with another in matters corporal.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "What is instituted for the sake of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, does not militate against <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>" (Cf. 11, 1, Objection 1). But we are bound by the precept of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> to succor our enemies, which is impossible without some sort of communication. Therefore it is lawful to communicate with an <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in corporal matters.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse11">1 Corinthians 5:11</a>): "With such an one not so much as to eat."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Excommunication is twofold: there is minor <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, which deprives a man merely of a share in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, but not of the communion of the faithful. Wherefore it is lawful to communicate with a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> lying under an <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> of this kind, but not to give him the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. The other is major <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> which deprives a man of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and of the communion of the faithful. Wherefore it is not lawful to communicate with one who lies under such an <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. But, since the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> resorts to <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> to repair and not to destroy, exception is made from this general <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, in certain matters wherein communication is lawful, viz. in those which concern <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, for one is allowed to speak of such matters with an <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; and one may even speak of other matters so as to put him at his ease and to make the words of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> more acceptable. Moreover exception is made in favor of certain people whose business it is to be in attendance on the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, viz. his wife, child, <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a>, vassal or subordinate. This, however, is to be understood of children who have not attained their majority, else they are forbidden to communicate with their father: and as to the others, the exception applies to them if they have entered his service before his <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, but not if they did so afterwards.

<p>Some understand this exception to apply in the opposite way, viz. that the master can communicate with his subjects: while others hold the contrary. At any rate it is lawful for them to communicate with others in matters wherein they are under an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to them, for just as subjects are bound to serve their master, so is the master bound to look after his subjects. Again certain cases are excepted; as when the fact of the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> is unknown, or in the case of strangers or travelers in the country of those who are <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, for they are allowed to buy from them, or to receive <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> from them. Likewise if anyone were to see an <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in distress: for then he would be bound by the precept of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> to assist him. These are all contained in the following line: "Utility, <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, lowliness, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of fact, <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>," where "utility" refers to salutary words, "<a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>" to marriage, "lowliness" to subjection. The others need no explanation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Corporal matters are subordinate to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> matters. Wherefore the power which extends to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, can also extend to matters touching the body: even as the art which considers the end commands in matters ordained to the end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In a case where one is bound by the precept of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> to hold communication, the prohibition ceases, as is clear from what has been said.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether a person incurs excommunication for communicating with one who is excommunicated?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> does not incur <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> for communicating with one who is <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. For a heathen or a <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jew</a> is more separated from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> than a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who is <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. But one does not incur <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> for communicating with a heathen or a <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jew</a>. Neither, therefore, does one for communicating with an <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if a man incurs <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> for communicating with an <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, for the same reason a third would incur <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> for communicating with him, and thus one might go on indefinitely, which would seem absurd. Therefore one does not incur <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> for communicating with one who is <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> An <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is banished from communion. Therefore whoever communicates with him leaves the communion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: and hence he seems to be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> may incur <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> in two ways. First, so that the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> includes both himself and whosoever communicates with him: and then, without any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, whoever communicates with him, incurs a major <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. Secondly, so that the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> is simply pronounced on him; and then a man may communicate with him either in his crime, by counsel, help or favor, in which case again he incurs the major <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, or he may communicate with him in other things by speaking to him, greeting him, or eating with him, in which case he incurs the minor <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The Church has no <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of correcting unbelievers as well as the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> who are under her care: hence she does not sever those, whom she excommunicates, from the fellowship of unbelievers, as she does from the communion of the faithful over whom she exercises a certain power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is lawful to hold communion with one who has incurred a minor <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, so that <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> does not pass on to a third <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether it is always a mortal sin to communicate with an excommunicated person in other cases than those in which it is allowed?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to hold communion with an <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in other cases than those in which it is allowed. Because a certain decretal (Cap. Sacris: De his quae vi, metuve, etc.) declares that "not even through fear of death should anyone hold communion with an <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, since one ought to die rather than commit a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." But this would be no reason unless it were always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to hold communion with an <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Therefore, etc.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to act against a commandment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> forbids anyone to hold communion with an <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Therefore it is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to hold communion with one who is <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is debarred from receiving the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> on account of a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But a man who holds communion with an <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, outside those cases in which it is allowed, is debarred from receiving the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, since he incurs a minor <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. Therefore it is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to hold communion with an <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, save in those cases in which it is allowed.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, no one should incur a major <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> save for a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> (Can. Praecipue, seqq., caus. xi) a man may incur a major <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> for holding communion with an <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Therefore it is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to hold communion with one who is <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> None can <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> a man from mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> unless he have <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over him. But any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> can <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> a man for holding communion with those who are <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. Therefore it is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>Further, the measure of the penalty should be according to the measure of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated in <a href="../bible/deu025.htm#verse3">Deuteronomy 25:3</a>. Now the punishment appointed by common custom for holding communion with an <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is not that which is inflicted for mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but rather that which is due for venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore it is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some hold that it is always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to hold communion with an <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, by word or in any of the forbidden ways mentioned above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), except in those cases allowed by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> (Cap. Quoniam). But since it seems very hard that a man should be guilty of a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by uttering just a slight word to an <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and that by excommunicating a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> one would endanger the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of many, and lay a snare which might turn to one's own hurt, it seems to others more probable that he is not always guilty of a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but only when he holds communion with him in a criminal <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, or in an act of Divine worship, or through contempt of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This decretal is speaking of holding communion in Divine worship. It may also be replied that the same reason applies both to mortal and venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, since just as one cannot do well by committing a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so neither can one by committing a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: so that just as it is a man's <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to suffer death rather than commit a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so is it his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to do so sooner than commit a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, inasmuch as it is his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to avoid venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The commandment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> regards <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> matters directly, and legitimate actions as a consequence: hence by holding communion in Divine worship one acts against the commandment, and commits a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but by holding communion in other matters, one acts beside the commandment, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> venially.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Sometimes a man is debarred from the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> even without his own fault, as in the case of those who are suspended or under an interdict, because these penalties are sometimes inflicted on one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of another who is thus punished.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Although it is a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to hold communion with one who is <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, yet to do so obstinately is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and for this reason one may be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.
