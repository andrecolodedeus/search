<h1>Question 23. How the passions differ from one another</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2023.htm#article1"> Are the passions of the concupiscible part different from those of the irascible part?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2023.htm#article2"> Is the contrariety of passions in the irascible part based on the contrariety of good and evil?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2023.htm#article3"> Is there any passion that has no contrary?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2023.htm#article4"> In the same power, are there any passions, differing in species, but not contrary to one another?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the passions of the concupiscible part are different from those of the irascible part?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the same <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are in the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> parts. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 5) that the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are those emotions "which are followed by <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> or sorrow." But <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and sorrow are in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> part. Therefore all the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> part, and not some in the irascible, others in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> part.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, on the words of <a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse33">Matthew 13:33</a>, "The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is like to leaven," etc., <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome's</a> <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "We should have <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> in the reason; <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> in the irascible faculty; desire of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> part." But <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty, as also is love, of which it is the contrary, as is stated in Topic. ii, 7. Therefore the same passion is in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> and irascible faculties.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and actions differ specifically according to their objects. But the objects of the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are the same, viz. <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore the same <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are in the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculties.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The acts of the different powers differ in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; for instance, to see, and to hear. But the irascible and the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> are two powers into which the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is divided, as stated in the I, 81, 2. Therefore, since the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are movements of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, as stated above (Question 22, Article 3), the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the irascible faculty are specifically distinct from those of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> part.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the irascible part differ in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from those of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty. For since different powers have different objects, as stated in the I, 77, 3, the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of different powers must of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> be referred to different objects. Much more, therefore, do the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of different faculties differ in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; since a greater difference in the object is required to diversify the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the powers, than to diversify the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> or actions. For just as in the physical order, diversity of genus arises from diversity in the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, while diversity of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> arises from diversity of form in the same <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; so in the acts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, those that belong to different powers, differ not only in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> but also in genus, while acts and <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> regarding different specific objects, included under the one common object of a single power, differ as the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of that genus.

<p>In order, therefore, to discern which <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are in the irascible, and which in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>, we must take the object of each of these powers. For we have stated in the I, 81, 2, that the object of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> power is sensible <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, simply apprehended as such, which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> pleasure or pain. But, since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> must, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, experience difficulty or struggle at times, in acquiring some such <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, or in avoiding some such <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, in so far as such <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is more than our animal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> can easily acquire or avoid; therefore this very <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, inasmuch as it is of an arduous or difficult <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, is the object of the irascible faculty. Therefore whatever <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> regard <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> absolutely, belong to the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> power; for instance, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, sorrow, love, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, and such like: whereas those <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> which regard <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or bad as arduous, through being difficult to obtain or avoid, belong to the irascible faculty; such are daring, fear, hope and the like.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated in the I, 81, 2, the irascible faculty is bestowed on animals, in order to remove the obstacles that hinder the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> power from tending towards its object, either by making some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> difficult to obtain, or by making some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> hard to avoid. The result is that all the irascible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> terminate in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>: and thus it is that even the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> which are in the irascible faculty are followed by <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and sadness which are in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> ascribes <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> to the irascible faculty, not by reason of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, which is properly a <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> passion; but on account of the struggle, which belongs to the irascible power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Good, inasmuch as it is delightful, moves the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> power. But if it <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> difficult to obtain, from this very fact it has a certain contrariety to the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> power: and hence the need of another power tending to that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. The same applies to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And this power is the irascible faculty. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are specifically different from the irascible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the contrariety of the irascible passions is based on the contrariety of good and evil?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the contrariety of the irascible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> is based on no other contrariety than that of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For the irascible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are ordained to the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, as stated above (01, ad 1). But the contrariety of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> is no other than that of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; take, for instance, love and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and sorrow. Therefore the same applies to the irascible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> differ according to their objects; just as movements differ according to their termini. But there is no other contrariety of movements, except that of the termini, as is stated in Phys. v, 3. Therefore there is no other contrariety of <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, save that of the objects. Now the object of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore in no <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power can there be contrariety of <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> other than that of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "every <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is by way of approach and withdrawal," as <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a> declares in his sixth book of Physics. Now approach results from the apprehension of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; withdrawal, from the apprehension of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: since just as "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is what all desire" (Ethic. i, 1), so <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is what all shun. Therefore, in the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, there can be no other contrariety than that of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Fear and daring are contrary to one another, as stated in Ethic. iii, 7. But fear and daring do not differ in respect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: because each regards some kind of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore not every contrariety of the irascible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> is that of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> is a kind of movement, as stated in Phys. iii, 3. Therefore contrariety of <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> is based on contrariety of movements or changes. Now there is a twofold contrariety in changes and movements, as stated in Phys. v, 5. One is according to approach and withdrawal in respect of the same term: and this contrariety belongs properly to changes, i.e. to generation, which is a change "to being," and to corruption, which is a change "from being." The other contrariety is according to opposition of termini, and belongs properly to movements: thus whitening, which is movement from black to white, is contrary to blackening, which is movement from white to black.

<p>Accordingly there is a twofold contrariety in the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: one, according to contrariety of objects, i.e. of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; the other, according to approach and withdrawal in respect of the same term. In the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> the former contrariety alone is to be found; viz. that which is based on the objects: whereas in the irascible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, we find both forms of contrariety. The reason of this is that the object of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), is sensible <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> considered absolutely. Now <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as such, cannot be a term wherefrom, but only a term whereto, since nothing shuns <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as such; on the contrary, all things desire it. In like manner, nothing desires <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as such; but all things shun it: wherefore <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> cannot have the aspect of a term whereto, but only of a term wherefrom. Accordingly every <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> passion in respect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, tends to it, as love, desire and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>; while every <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> passion in respect of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, tends from it, as <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, avoidance or dislike, and sorrow. Wherefore, in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, there can be no contrariety of approach and withdrawal in respect of the same object.

<p>On the other hand, the object of the irascible faculty is sensible <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, considered not absolutely, but under the aspect of difficulty or arduousness. Now the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is difficult or arduous, considered as <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, is of such a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as to produce in us a tendency to it, which tendency pertains to the passion of "hope"; whereas, considered as arduous or difficult, it makes us turn from it; and this pertains to the passion of "<a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>." In like manner the arduous <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, considered as an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, has the aspect of something to be shunned; and this belongs to the passion of "fear": but it also contains a reason for tending to it, as attempting something arduous, whereby to escape being subject to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; and this tendency is called "daring." Consequently, in the irascible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> we find contrariety in respect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> (as between hope and fear): and also contrariety according to approach and withdrawal in respect of the same term (as between daring and fear).

<p>From what has been said the replies to the objections are evident.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether any passion of the soul has no contrariety?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that every <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has a contrary. For every <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is either in the irascible or in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). But both kinds of passion have their respective modes of contrariety. Therefore every <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has its contrary.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has either <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for its object; for these are the common objects of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> part. But a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> having <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for its object, is contrary to a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> having <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for its object. Therefore every <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> has a contrary.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is in respect of approach or withdrawal, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). But every approach has a corresponding contrary withdrawal, and vice versa. Therefore every <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has a contrary.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Anger is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But no passion is set down as being contrary to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, as stated in Ethic. iv, 5. Therefore not every <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> has a contrary.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The passion of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is peculiar in this, that it cannot have a contrary, either according to approach and withdrawal, or according to the contrariety of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by a difficult <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> already present: and when such an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is present, the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> must needs either succumb, so that it does not go beyond the limits of "sadness," which is a <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> passion; or else it has a movement of attack on the hurtful <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, which movement is that of "<a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>." But it cannot have a movement of withdrawal: because the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is supposed to be already present or past. Thus no passion is contrary to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> according to contrariety of approach and withdrawal.

<p>In like manner neither can there be according to contrariety of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Because the opposite of present <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> obtained, which can be no longer have the aspect of arduousness or difficulty. Nor, when once <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is obtained, does there remain any other movement, except the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite's</a> repose in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> obtained; which repose belongs to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, which is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty.

<p>Accordingly no movement of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> can be contrary to the movement of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and nothing else than cessation from its movement is contrary thereto; thus the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 3) that "calm is contrary to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>," by opposition not of contrariety but of negation or privation.

<p>From what has been said the replies to the objections are evident.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether in the same power, there are any passions, specifically different, but not contrary to one another?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there cannot be, in the same power, specifically different <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> that are not contrary to one another. For the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> differ according to their objects. Now the objects of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; and on this distinction is based the contrariety of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Therefore no <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the same power, that are not contrary to one another, differ specifically.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, difference of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> implies a difference of form. But every difference of form is in respect of some contrariety, as stated in Metaph. x, 8. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the same power, that are not contrary to one another, do not differ specifically.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, since every <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> consists in approach or withdrawal in respect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, it seems that every difference in the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> must needs arise from the difference of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; or from the difference of approach and withdrawal; or from degrees in approach or withdrawal. Now the first two differences <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> contrariety in the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>): whereas the third difference does not diversify the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; else the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> would be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. Therefore it is not possible for <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the same power to differ in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, without being contrary to one another.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Love and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> differ in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and are in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> power; and yet they are not contrary to one another; rather, in fact, one <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the other. Therefore in the same power there are <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> that differ in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> without being contrary to one another.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Passions differ in accordance with their active <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, which, in the case of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, are their objects. Now, the difference in active <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> may be considered in two ways: first, from the point of view of their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> or <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as fire differs from water; secondly, from the point of view of the difference in their active power. In the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> we can treat the difference of their active or motive <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> in respect of their motive power, as if they were <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> agents. For every mover, in a fashion, either draws the patient to itself, or repels it from itself. Now in drawing it to itself, it does three things in the patient. Because, in the first place, it gives the patient an inclination or aptitude to tend to the mover: thus a light body, which is above, bestows lightness on the body generated, so that it has an inclination or aptitude to be above. Secondly, if the generated body be outside its proper place, the mover gives it movement towards that place. Thirdly, it makes it to rest, when it shall have come to its proper place: since to the same <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> are due, both rest in a place, and the movement to that place. The same applies to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of repulsion.

<p>Now, in the movements of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> faculty, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> has, as it were, a force of attraction, while <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> has a force of repulsion. In the first place, therefore, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, a certain inclination, aptitude or connaturalness in respect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: and this belongs to the passion of "love": the corresponding contrary of which is "<a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>" in respect of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Secondly, if the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> be not yet possessed, it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> a movement towards the attainment of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> beloved: and this belongs to the passion of "desire" or "<a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>": and contrary to it, in respect of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, is the passion of "aversion" or "dislike." Thirdly, when the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is obtained, it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> to rest, as it were, in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> obtained: and this belongs to the passion of "delight" or "<a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>"; the contrary of which, in respect of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, is "sorrow" or "sadness."

<p>On the other hand, in the irascible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, the aptitude, or inclination to seek <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, or to shun <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, is presupposed as arising from the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty, which regards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> absolutely. And in respect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> not yet obtained, we have "hope" and "<a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>." In respect of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> not yet present we have "fear" and "daring." But in respect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> obtained there is no irascible passion: because it is no longer considered in the light of something arduous, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). But <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> already present gives rise to the passion of "<a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>."

<p>Accordingly it is clear that in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty there are three couples of <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>; viz. love and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, desire and aversion, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and sadness. In like manner there are three groups in the irascible faculty; viz. hope and <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, fear and daring, and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> which has not contrary passion.

<p>Consequently there are altogether eleven <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> differing specifically; six in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty, and five in the irascible; and under these all the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are contained.

<p>From this the replies to the objections are evident.
