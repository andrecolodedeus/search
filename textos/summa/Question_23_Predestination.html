<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether men are predestined by God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that men are not predestined by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 30): "It must be borne in mind that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> foreknows but does not predetermine everything, since He foreknows all that is in us, but does not predetermine it all." But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> and demerit are in us, forasmuch as we are the masters of our own acts by <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>. All that pertains therefore to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> or demerit is not predestined by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and thus <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is done away.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, all creatures are directed to their end by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a>, as was said above (22, 1, 2). But other creatures are not said to be predestined by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore neither are men.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are capable of beatitude, as well as men. But <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is not suitable to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, since in them there never was any unhappiness (miseria); for <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De praedest. sanct. 17), is the "purpose to take pity [miserendi]" [See 22, 3]. Therefore men are not predestined.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the benefits <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> confers upon men are revealed by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men according to the saying of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 2:12</a>): "Now we have received not the spirit of this world, but the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> that is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the things that are given us from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> were predestined by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is a benefit from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, his <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> would be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to each predestined; which is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse30">Romans 8:30</a>): "Whom He predestined, them He also called."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is fitting that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should predestine men. For all things are subject to His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, as was shown above (Question 22, Article 2). Now it belongs to <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> to direct things towards their end, as was also said (22, 1, 2). The end towards which <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things are directed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is twofold; one which exceeds all proportion and faculty of <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and this end is life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, that consists in seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> which is above the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of every creature, as shown above (Question 12, Article 4). The other end, however, is proportionate to <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, to which end <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> being can attain according to the power of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now if a thing cannot attain to something by the power of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it must be directed thereto by another; thus, an arrow is directed by the archer towards a mark. Hence, properly speaking, a rational creature, capable of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, is led towards it, directed, as it were, by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The reason of that direction pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; as in Him is the type of the order of all things towards an end, which we <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> above to be <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>. Now the type in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the doer of something to be done, is a kind of pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in him of the thing to be done. Hence the type of the aforesaid direction of a rational creature towards the end of life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> is called <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>. For to destine, is to direct or send. Thus it is clear that <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, as regards its objects, is a part of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> calls <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> an imposition of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, after the manner of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things which are predetermined towards one end. This is clear from his adding: "He does not will <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, nor does He compel <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>." Whence <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is not excluded by Him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Irrational creatures are not capable of that end which exceeds the faculty of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Whence they cannot be properly said to be predestined; although improperly the term is used in respect of any other end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Predestination applies to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, just as it does to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, although they have never been unhappy. For movement does not take its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the term "wherefrom" but from the term "whereto." Because it matters nothing, in respect of the notion of making white, whether he who is made white was before black, yellow or red. Likewise it matters nothing in respect of the notion of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> whether one is predestined to life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> from the state of misery or not. Although it may be said that every conferring of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> above that which is due pertains to mercy; as was shown previously (21, 3 and 4).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Even if by a special privilege their <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> were revealed to some, it is not fitting that it should be revealed to everyone; because, if so, those who were not predestined would <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>; and security would beget negligence in the predestined.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether predestination places anything in the predestined?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> does place something in the predestined. For every action of itself <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> passion. If therefore <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is action in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> must be passion in the predestined.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> says on the text, "He who was predestined," etc. (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse4">Romans 1:4</a>): "Predestination is of one who is not; destination, of one who is." And <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Praed. Sanct.): "What is <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> but the destination of one who is?" Therefore <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is only of one who actually <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>; and it thus places something in the predestined.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, preparation is something in the thing prepared. But <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is the preparation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> benefits, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Praed. Sanct. ii, 14). Therefore <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is something in the predestined.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, nothing temporal enters into the definition of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which is something temporal, is found in the definition of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>. For <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is the preparation of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in the present; and of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the future. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is not anything <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. So it must needs be that it is in the predestined, and not in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for whatever is in Him is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Praed. Sanct. ii, 14) that "<a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is the foreknowledge of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> benefits." But foreknowledge is not in the things foreknown, but in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who foreknows them. Therefore, <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is in the one who predestines, and not in the predestined.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Predestination is not anything in the predestined; but only in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who predestines. We have said above that <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is a part of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> is not anything in the things provided for; but is a type in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the provider, as was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> above (Question 22, Article 1). But the execution of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> which is called government, is in a passive way in the thing governed, and in an active way in the governor. Whence it is clear that <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is a kind of type of the ordering of some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> towards <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the divine mind. The execution, however, of this order is in a passive way in the predestined, but actively in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The execution of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is the calling and magnification; according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse30">Romans 8:30</a>): "Whom He predestined, them He also called and whom He called, them He also magnified [Vulg. 'justified']."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Actions passing out to external <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> imply of themselves passion--for example, the actions of warming and cutting; but not so actions remaining in the agent, as understanding and willing, as said above (14, 2; 18, 3, ad 1). Predestination is an action of this latter class. Wherefore, it does not put anything in the predestined. But its execution, which passes out to external things, has an effect in them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Destination sometimes denotes a real mission of someone to a given end; thus, destination can only be said of someone actually <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a>. It is taken, however, in another sense for a mission which a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> conceives in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>; and in this manner we are said to destine a thing which we firmly propose in our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. In this latter way it is said that Eleazar "determined not to do any unlawful things for the love of life" (<a href="../bible/2ma006.htm#verse20">2 Maccabees 6:20</a>). Thus destination can be of a thing which does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>. Predestination, however, by reason of the antecedent <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> it implies, can be attributed to a thing which does not actually <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>; in whatsoever way destination is accepted.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Preparation is twofold: of the patient in respect to passion and this is in the thing prepared; and of the agent to action, and this is in the agent. Such a preparation is <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, and as an agent by <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is said to prepare itself to act, accordingly as it preconceives the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of what is to be done. Thus, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> prepared by <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, conceiving the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the order of some towards <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Grace</a> does not come into the definition of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, as something belonging to its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, but inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> implies a relation to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to effect, and of act to its object. Whence it does not follow that <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is anything temporal.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether God reprobates any man?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> reprobates no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For nobody reprobates what he loves. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> loves every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, according to (<a href="../bible/wis011.htm#verse25">Wisdom 11:25</a>): "Thou lovest all things that are, and Thou hatest none of the things Thou hast made." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> reprobates no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> reprobates any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, it would be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for reprobation to have the same relation to the reprobates as <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> has to the predestined. But <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the predestined. Therefore reprobation will likewise be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the loss of the reprobate. But this <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. For it is said (<a href="../bible/hos013.htm#verse9">Hosea 13:9</a>): "Destruction is thy own, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; Thy help is only in Me." <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not, then, reprobate any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to no one ought anything be imputed which he cannot avoid. But if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> reprobates anyone, that one must perish. For it is said (<a href="../bible/ecc007.htm#verse14">Ecclesiastes 7:14</a>): "Consider the works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can correct whom He hath despised." Therefore it could not be imputed to any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, were he to perish. But this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not reprobate anyone.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/mal001.htm#verse2">Malachi 1:2-3</a>): "I have loved <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, but have <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does reprobate some. For it was said above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>) that <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is a part of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>. To <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, however, it belongs to permit certain defects in those things which are subject to <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, as was said above (Question 22, Article 2). Thus, as men are ordained to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> through the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it likewise is part of that <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> to permit some to fall away from that end; this is called reprobation. Thus, as <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is a part of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, in regard to those ordained to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, so reprobation is a part of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> in regard to those who turn aside from that end. Hence reprobation implies not only foreknowledge, but also something more, as does <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, as was said above (Question 22, Article 1). Therefore, as <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> includes the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to confer <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; so also reprobation includes the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to permit a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to fall into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and to impose the punishment of damnation on account of that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> loves all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and all creatures, inasmuch as He wishes them all some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; but He does not wish every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to them all. So far, therefore, as He does not wish this particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>--namely, <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>--He is said to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> or reprobated them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Reprobation differs in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> from <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>. This latter is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> both of what is expected in the future life by the predestined--namely, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>--and of what is received in this life--namely, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Reprobation, however, is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of what is in the present--namely, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but it is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of abandonment by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, however, of what is assigned in the future--namely, <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a>. But guilt proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who is reprobated and deserted by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. In this way, the word of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>--namely, "Destruction is thy own, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Reprobation by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not take anything away from the power of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> reprobated. Hence, when it is said that the reprobated cannot obtain <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, this must not be understood as implying absolute impossibility: but only conditional impossibility: as was said above (Question 19, Article 3), that the predestined must <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> be saved; yet a conditional <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, which does not do away with the liberty of choice. Whence, although anyone reprobated by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot acquire <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, nevertheless that he falls into this or that particular <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> comes from the use of his <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. Hence it is rightly imputed to him as guilt.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the predestined are chosen by God?</h2> ["Eligantur."]

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the predestined are not chosen by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv, 1) that as the corporeal sun sends his rays upon all without selection, so does <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is communicated to some in an especial manner through a participation of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> without any selection communicates His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; and this belongs to <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, election is of things that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>. But <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is also of things which do not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>. Therefore, some are predestined without election.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, election implies some discrimination. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "wills all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to be saved" (<a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse4">1 Timothy 2:4</a>). Therefore, <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> which ordains men towards <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, is without election.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse4">Ephesians 1:4</a>): "He chose us in Him before the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">foundation</a> of the world."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Predestination presupposes election in the order of reason; and election presupposes love. The reason of this is that <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), is a part of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, as also <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, is the plan <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> directing the ordering of some things towards an end; as was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> above (Question 22, Article 2). But nothing is directed towards an end unless the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> for that end already <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>. Whence the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> of some to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> presupposes, in the order of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; and to this belong both election and love:--love, inasmuch as He wills them this particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; since to love is to wish well to anyone, as stated above (20, 2, 3):--election, inasmuch as He wills this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to some in preference to others; since He reprobates some, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). Election and love, however, are differently ordered in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in ourselves: because in us the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but we are incited to love by the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which already <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>; and therefore we choose someone to love, and so election in us precedes love. In <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, however, it is the reverse. For His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, by which in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> He wishes <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to someone, is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> possessed by some in preference to others. Thus it is clear that love precedes election in the order of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, and election precedes <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>. Whence all the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinate</a> are objects of election and love.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> If the communication of the divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> in general be considered, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> communicates His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> without election; inasmuch as there is nothing which does not in some way share in His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, as we said above (Question 6, Article 4). But if we consider the communication of this or that particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, He does not allot it without election; since He gives certain goods to some men, which He does not give to others. Thus in the conferring of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> election is implied.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> choosing is incited to make a choice by the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> already pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the object chosen, the choice must needs be of those things which already <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, as happens in our choice. In <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> it is otherwise; as was said above (Question 20, Article 2). Thus, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Verb. Ap. Serm. 11): "Those are chosen by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who do not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>; yet He does not <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> in His choice."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to be saved by His antecedent will, which is to will not simply but relatively; and not by His consequent will, which is to will simply.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the foreknowledge of merits is the cause of predestination?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that foreknowledge of merits is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse29">Romans 8:29</a>): "Whom He foreknew, He also predestined." Again a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> on <a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse15">Romans 9:15</a>: "I will have mercy upon whom I will have mercy" says: "I will give mercy to him who, I foresee, will turn to Me with his whole heart." Therefore it seems the foreknowledge of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, Divine <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> includes the divine will, which by no means can be irrational; since <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is "the purpose to have mercy," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Praed. Sanct. ii, 17). But there can be no other reason for <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> than the foreknowledge of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>. Therefore it must be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of reason of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "There is no <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse14">Romans 9:14</a>). Now it would seem <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> that unequal things be given to equals. But all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are equal as regards both <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>; and inequality in them arises from the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> or demerits of their actions. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not prepare unequal things for men by <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinating</a> and reprobating, unless through the foreknowledge of their <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> and demerits.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/tit003.htm#verse5">Titus 3:5</a>): "Not by works of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us." But as He saved us, so He predestined that we should be saved. Therefore, foreknowledge of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> or reason of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> includes will, as was said above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>), the reason of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> must be sought for in the same way as was the reason of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now it was shown above (Question 19, Article 5), that we cannot assign any <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the divine will on the part of the act of willing; but a reason can be found on the part of the things willed; inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills one thing on account of something else. Wherefore nobody has been so insane as to say that <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of divine <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> as regards the act of the predestinator. But this is the question, whether, as regards the effect, <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> has any <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; or what comes to the same thing, whether <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> pre-ordained that He would give the effect of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> to anyone on account of any <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>.

<p>Accordingly there were some who held that the effect of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> was pre-ordained for some on account of pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> in a former life. This was the opinion of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, who thought that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in the beginning, and according to the diversity of their works different states were assigned to them in this world when united with the body. The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>, however, rebuts this opinion where he says (<a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse11">Romans 9:11-12</a>): "For when they were not yet born, nor had done any <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> . . . not of works, but of Him that calleth, it was said of her: The elder shall serve the younger."

<p>Others said that pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> in this life are the reason and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the effect of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>. For the Pelagians taught that the beginning of doing well came from us; and the consummaion from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: so that it came about that the effect of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> was granted to one, and not to another, because the one made a beginning by preparing, whereas the other did not. But against this we have the saying of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse5">2 Corinthians 3:5</a>), that "we are not sufficient to think anything of ourselves as of ourselves." Now no principle of action can be <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagined</a> previous to the act of thinking. Wherefore it cannot be said that anything begun in us can be the reason of the effect of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>.

<p>And so others said that <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> following the effect of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> are the reason of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>; giving us to understand that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gives <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and pre-ordains that He will give it, because He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> beforehand that He will make <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> use of that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as if a king were to give a horse to a soldier because he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> he will make <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> use of it. But these seem to have drawn a distinction between that which flows from <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and that which flows from <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, as if the same thing cannot come from both. It is, however, manifest that what is of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is the effect of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>; and this cannot be considered as the reason of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, since it is contained in the notion of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>. Therefore, if anything else in us be the reason of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, it will outside the effect of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>. Now there is no distinction between what flows from <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, and what is of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>; as there is not distinction between what flows from a secondary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and from a first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> produces effects through the operation of secondary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, as was above shown (22, 3). Wherefore, that which flows from <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is also of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>. We must say, therefore, that the effect of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> may be considered in a twofold light--in one way, in particular; and thus there is no reason why one effect of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> should not be the reason or <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of another; a subsequent effect being the reason of a previous effect, as its final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; and the previous effect being the reason of the subsequent as its <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, which is reduced to the disposition of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Thus we might say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> pre-ordained to give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> on account of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, and that He pre-ordained to give <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. In another way, the effect of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> may be considered in general. Thus, it is impossible that the whole of the effect of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> in general should have any <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> as coming from us; because whatsoever is in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> disposing him towards <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, is all included under the effect of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>; even the preparation for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For neither does this happen otherwise than by divine help, according to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremias</a> (<a href="../bible/lam005.htm#verse21">Lamentations 5:21</a>): "convert us, O Lord, to Thee, and we shall be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>." Yet <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> has in this way, in regard to its effect, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for its reason; towards which the whole effect of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is directed as to an end; and from which it proceeds, as from its first moving principle.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The use of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> foreknown by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of conferring <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, except after the manner of a final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; as was explained above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Predestination has its foundation in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as regards its effects in general. Considered in its particular effects, however, one effect is the reason of another; as already stated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The reason for the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> of some, and reprobation of others, must be sought for in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Thus He is said to have made all things through His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, so that the divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> might be represented in things. Now it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, which in itself is one and undivided, should be manifested in many ways in His creation; because creatures in themselves cannot attain to the simplicity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Thus it is that for the completion of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> there are required different grades of being; some of which hold a high and some a low place in the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. That this multiformity of grades may be preserved in things, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> allows some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, lest many <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things should never happen, as was said above (Question 22, Article 2). Let us then consider the whole of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, as we consider the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills to manifest His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> in men; in respect to those whom He predestines, by means of His mercy, as sparing them; and in respect of others, whom he reprobates, by means of His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, in punishing them. This is the reason why <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> elects some and rejects others. To this the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> refers, saying (<a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse22">Romans 9:22-23</a>): "What if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, willing to show His wrath [that is, the vengeance of His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>], and to make His power <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, endured [that is, permitted] with much patience vessels of wrath, fitted for destruction; that He might show the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> on the vessels of mercy, which He hath prepared unto <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>" and (<a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse20">2 Timothy 2:20</a>): "But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver; but also of wood and of earth; and some, indeed, unto <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, but some unto dishonor." Yet why He chooses some for <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and reprobates others, has no reason, except the divine <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Whence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. xxvi. in Joan.): "Why He draws one, and another He draws not, seek not to judge, if thou dost not wish to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>." Thus too, in the things of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, a reason can be assigned, since primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is altogether uniform, why one part of it was fashioned by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from the beginning under the form of fire, another under the form of earth, that there might be a diversity of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in things of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Yet why this particular part of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is under this particular form, and that under another, depends upon the simple will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; as from the simple will of the artificer it depends that this stone is in part of the wall, and that in another; although the plan requires that some stones should be in this place, and some in that place. Neither on this account can there be said to be <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if He prepares unequal lots for not unequal things. This would be altogether contrary to the notion of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, if the effect of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> were granted as a debt, and not gratuitously. In things which are given gratuitously, a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> can give more or less, just as he pleases (provided he deprives nobody of his due), without any infringement of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. This is what the master of the house said: "Take what is thine, and go thy way. Is it not lawful for me to do what I will?" (<a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse14">Matthew 20:14-15</a>).

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether predestination is certain?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is not certain. Because on the words "Hold fast that which thou hast, that no one take thy crown," (<a href="../bible/rev003.htm#verse11">Apocalypse 3:11</a>), <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Corr. et Grat. 15): "Another will not receive, unless this one were to lose it." Hence the crown which is the effect of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> can be both acquired and lost. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> cannot be certain.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, granted what is possible, nothing impossible follows. But it is possible that one predestined--e.g. <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>--may <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and then be killed. But if this were so, it would follow that the effect of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> would be thwarted. This then, is not impossible. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is not certain.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whatever <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> could do in the past, He can do now. But He could have not predestined whom He hath predestined. Therefore now He is able not to predestine him. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is not certain.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse29">Romans 8:29</a>: "Whom He foreknew, He also <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>", says: "Predestination is the foreknowledge and preparation of the benefits of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by which whosoever are freed will most certainly be freed."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Predestination most certainly and infallibly takes effect; yet it does not impose any <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, so that, namely, its effect should take place from <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. For it was said above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), that <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is a part of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>. But not all things subject to <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>; some things happening from contingency, according to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the proximate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, which <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a> has ordained for such effects. Yet the order of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> is <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a>, as was shown above (Question 22, Article 4). So also the order of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>; yet <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is not destroyed; whence the effect of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> has its contingency. Moreover all that has been said about the divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and will (14, 13; 19, 4) must also be taken into consideration; since they do not destroy contingency in things, although they themselves are most certain and <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The crown may be said to belong to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in two ways; first, by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, and thus no one loses his crown: secondly, by the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; for what we <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, in a certain way is ours; and thus anyone may lose his crown by mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> receives that crown thus lost, inasmuch as he takes the former's place. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not permit some to fall, without raising others; according to <a href="../bible/job034.htm#verse24">Job 34:24</a>: "He shall break in pieces many and innumerable, and make others to stand in their stead." Thus men are substituted in the place of the fallen <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> in that of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>. He who is substituted for another in the state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a>, also receives the crown of the fallen in that in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> he will rejoice at the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> the other has done, in which life he will rejoice at all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> whether done by himself or by others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although it is possible for one who is <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> considered in himself to die in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; yet it is not possible, supposed, as in fact it is supposed. that he is predestinated. Whence it does not follow that <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> can fall short of its effect.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> includes the divine will as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>): and the fact that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> thing is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> on the supposition that He so wills, on account of the immutability of the divine will, but is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> absolutely; so the same must be said of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>. Wherefore one ought not to say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is able not to <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinate</a> one whom He has <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>, taking it in a composite sense, thought, absolutely speaking, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinate</a> or not. But in this way the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is not destroyed.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the number of the predestined is certain?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the number of the predestined is not certain. For a number to which an addition can be made is not certain. But there can be an addition to the number of the predestined as it seems; for it is written (<a href="../bible/deu001.htm#verse11">Deuteronomy 1:11</a>): "The Lord <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> adds to this number many thousands," and a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> adds, "fixed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> those who belong to Him." Therefore the number of the predestined is not certain.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no reason can be assigned why <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> pre-ordains to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> one number of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> more than another. But nothing is arranged by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> without a reason. Therefore the number to be saved pre-ordained by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be certain.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the operations of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are more perfect than those of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But in the works of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is found in the majority of things; defect and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the minority. If, then, the number of the saved were fixed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> at a certain figure, there would be more saved than lost. Yet the contrary follows from <a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse13">Matthew 7:13-14</a>: "For wide is the gate, and broad the way that leadeth to destruction, and many there are who go in thereat. How narrow is the gate, and strait is the way that leadeth to life; and few there are who find it!" Therefore the number of those pre-ordained by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be saved is not certain.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Corr. et Grat. 13): "The number of the predestined is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>, and can neither be increased nor diminished."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The number of the predestined is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>. Some have said that it was formally, but not materially certain; as if we were to say that it was certain that a hundred or a thousand would be saved; not however these or those <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>. But this destroys the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>; of which we spoke above (<a href="#6">Article 6</a>). Therefore we must say that to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the number of the predestined is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>, not only formally, but also materially. It must, however, be observed that the number of the predestined is said to be certain to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not by reason of His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, because, that is to say, He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how many will be saved (for in this way the number of drops of rain and the sands of the sea are certain to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>); but by reason of His deliberate choice and determination. For the further evidence of which we must remember that every agent intends to make something finite, as is clear from what has been said above when we treated of the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> (7, 2, 3). Now whosoever intends some definite measure in his effect thinks out some definite number in the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> parts, which are by their very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> required for the perfection of the whole. For of those things which are required not principally, but only on account of something else, he does not select any definite number "per se"; but he accepts and uses them in such numbers as are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> on account of that other thing. For instance, a builder thinks out the definite measurements of a house, and also the definite number of rooms which he wishes to make in the house; and definite measurements of the walls and roof; he does not, however, select a definite number of stones, but accepts and uses just so many as are sufficient for the required measurements of the wall. So also must we consider concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in regard to the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, which is His effect. For He pre-ordained the measurements of the whole of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, and what number would befit the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> parts of that <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>--that is to say, which have in some way been ordained in perpetuity; how many spheres, how many stars, how many elements, and how many <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Individuals, however, which undergo corruption, are not ordained as it were chiefly for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, but in a secondary way, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is preserved through them. Whence, although <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the total number of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, the number of oxen, flies and such like, is not pre-ordained by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "per se"; but <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a> produces just so many as are sufficient for the preservation of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Now of all creatures the rational creature is chiefly ordained for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, being as such incorruptible; more especially those who attain to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, since they more immediately reach the ultimate end. Whence the number of the predestined is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; not only by way of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but also by way of a principal pre-ordination.

<p>It is not exactly the same thing in the case of the number of the reprobate, who would seem to be pre-ordained by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>, in whose regard "all things work together unto <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse28">Romans 8:28</a>). Concerning the number of all the predestined, some say that so many men will be saved as <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> fell; some, so many as there were <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> left; others, as many as the number of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It is, however, better to say that, "to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the number for whom is reserved <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> [From the 'secret' <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the missal, 'pro vivis et defunctis.']"

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> These words of <a href="../bible/deu000.htm">Deuteronomy</a> must be taken as applied to those who are marked out by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> beforehand in respect to present righteousness. For their number is increased and diminished, but not the number of the predestined.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The reason of the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of any one part must be judged from the proportion of that part of the whole. Thus in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the reason why He has made so many stars, or so many <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of things, or predestined so many, is according to the proportion of the principal parts to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that is proportionate to the common state of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is to be found in the majority; and is wanting in the minority. The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that exceeds the common state of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is to be found in the minority, and is wanting in the majority. Thus it is clear that the majority of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> have a sufficient <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> for the guidance of life; and those who have not this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> are said to be half-witted or foolish; but they who attain to a profound <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things intelligible are a very small minority in respect to the rest. Since their <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, consisting in the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a>, exceeds the common state of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and especially in so far as this is deprived of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> through the corruption of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, those who are saved are in the minority. In this especially, however, appears the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that He has chosen some for that <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, from which very many in accordance with the common course and tendency of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> fall short.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether predestination can be furthered by the prayers of the saints?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> cannot be furthered by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. For nothing <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> can be preceded by anything temporal; and in consequence nothing temporal can help towards making something else <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. But <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. Therefore, since the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are temporal, they cannot so help as to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> anyone to become predestined. Predestination therefore is not furthered by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as there is no need of advice except on account of defective <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, so there is not need of help except through defective power. But neither of these things can be said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> when He predestines. Whence it is said: "Who hath helped the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a>? [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Who hath <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the Lord?'] Or who hath been His counsellor?" (<a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse34">Romans 11:34</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> cannot be furthered by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if a thing can be helped, it can also be hindered. But <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> cannot be hindered by anything. Therefore it cannot be furthered by anything.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said that "<a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> besought the Lord for his wife because she was barren; and He heard him and made Rebecca to conceive" (<a href="../bible/gen025.htm#verse21">Genesis 25:21</a>). But from that conception <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> was born, and he was predestined. Now his <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> would not have happened if he had never been born. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> can be furthered by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Concerning this question, there were different <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. Some, regarding the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of divine <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, said that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> were superfluous, as also anything else done to attain <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; because whether these things were done or not, the predestined would attain, and the reprobate would not attain, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. But against this opinion are all the warnings of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Scripture</a>, exhorting us to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works.

<p>Others declared that the divine <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> was altered through <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. This is stated to have the opinion of the Egyptians, who thought that the divine ordination, which they called fate, could be frustrated by certain <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. Against this also is the authority of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>. For it is said: "But the triumpher in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> will not spare and will not be moved to repentance" (<a href="../bible/1sa015.htm#verse29">1 Samuel 15:29</a>); and that "the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> and the calling of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are without repentance" (<a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse29">Romans 11:29</a>).

<p>Wherefore we must say otherwise that in <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> two things are to be considered--namely, the divine ordination; and its effect. As regards the former, in no possible way can <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> be furthered by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. For it is not due to their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> that anyone is predestined by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. As regards the latter, <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is said to be helped by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and by other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works; because <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, of which <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is a part, does not do away with secondary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> but so provides effects, that the order of secondary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> falls also under <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>. So, as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> effects are provided by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in such a way that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> are directed to bring about those <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> effects, without which those effects would not happen; so the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is predestined by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in such a way, that whatever helps that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> towards <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> falls under the order of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>; whether it be one's own <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> or those of another; or other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works, and such like, without which one would not attain to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Whence, the predestined must strive after <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; because through these means <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is most certainly fulfilled. For this reason it is said: "Labor more that by <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works you may make sure your calling and election" (<a href="../bible/2pe001.htm#verse10">2 Peter 1:10</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument shows that <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is not furthered by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, as regards the preordination.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> One is said to be helped by another in two ways; in one way, inasmuch as he receives power from him: and to be helped thus belongs to the weak; but this cannot be said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and thus we are to understand, "Who hath helped the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a>?" In another way one is said to be helped by a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> through whom he carries out his work, as a master through a servant. In this way <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is helped by us; inasmuch as we execute His orders, according to <a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse9">1 Corinthians 3:9</a>: "We are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> co-adjutors." Nor is this on account of any defect in the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but because He employs intermediary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, in order that the beauty of order may be preserved in the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>; and also that He may communicate to creatures the dignity of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Secondary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> cannot escape the order of the first universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as has been said above (Question 19, Article 6), indeed, they execute that order. And therefore <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> can be furthered by creatures, but it cannot be impeded by them.
