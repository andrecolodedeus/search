<h1>Question 24. Absolution from excommunication</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5024.htm#article1"> Can any priest absolve his subject from excommunication?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5024.htm#article2"> Can a man be absolved from excommunication against his will?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5024.htm#article3"> Can a man be absolved from one excommunication without being absolved from another?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether any priest can absolve his subject from excommunication?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> can <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> his subject from <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. For the chains of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are stronger than those of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. But any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> can <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> his subject from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore much more can he <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> him from <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is removed the effect is removed. But the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore since any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> can <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> (his subject) from that mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he is able likewise to <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> him from the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It belongs to the same power to <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> as to <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> from <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. But <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of inferior degree cannot <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> their subjects. Neither, therefore, can they <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> them.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Anyone can <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> from minor <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> who can <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of participation in the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of another. But in the case of a major <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, this is pronounced either by a judge, and then he who pronounced sentence or his superior can <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a>--or it is pronounced by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and then the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or even a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> can <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> except in the six cases which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, who is the maker of laws, reserves to himself: the first is the case of a man who lays hands on a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> or a religious; the second is of one who breaks into a church and is denounced for so doing; the third is of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who sets fire to a church and is denounced for the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>; the fourth is of one who knowingly communicates in the Divine worship with those whom the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a> has <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by name; the fifth is the case of one who tampers with the letters of the Holy See; the sixth is the case of one who communicates in a crime of one who is <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. For he should not be <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> except by the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> him, even though he be not subject to him, unless, by reason of the difficulty of appearing before him, he be <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or by his own <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, after binding himself by <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to submit to the command of the judge who pronounced the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> on him.

<p>There are however eight exceptions to the first case: (1) In the hour of death, when a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> can be <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> by any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> from any <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>; (2) if the striker be the doorkeeper of a man in authority, and the blow be given neither through <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> nor of set purpose; (3) if the striker be a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>; (4) if the striker be a servant, whose master is not at fault and would suffer from his absence; (5) if a religious strike a religious, unless he strike him very grievously; (6) if the striker be a poor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; (7) if he be a minor*, an old <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, or an invalid; (8) if there be a deadly feud between them.

<p>There are, besides, seven cases in which the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who strikes a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> does not incur <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>: (1) if he do it for the sake of discipline, as a teacher or a superior; (2) if it be done for fun; (3) if the striker find the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> behaving with impropriety towards his wife his mother, his sister or his daughter; (4) if he return blow for blow at once; (5) if the striker be not aware that he is striking a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>; (6) if the latter be guilty of apostasy after the triple admonition; (7) if the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> exercise an act which is altogether contrary to the clerical life, e.g. if he become a soldier, or if he be guilty of <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">bigamy</a> [Namely, that which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by canonists as "similar <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">bigamy</a>"].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although the chains of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are in themselves greater than those of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, yet in a certain respect the chains of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> are greater, inasmuch as they bind a man not only in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but also in the eye of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> from <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> requires <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in the external forum, whereas <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not. Nor is there need of giving one's word by <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, as in the case of <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> from <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, because, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> declares (<a href="../bible/heb006.htm#verse16">Hebrews 6:16</a>), controversies between men are decided by <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As an <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> has no share in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> him from his guilt, unless he be first <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> from <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether anyone can be absolved against his will?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can be <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> against his will. For <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things are not conferred on anyone against his will. Now <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> from <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> favor. Therefore it cannot be granted to a man against his will.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> is contumacy. But when, through contempt of the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, a man is unwilling to be <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a>, he shows a high degree of contumacy. Therefore he cannot be <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Excommunication can be pronounced on a man against his will. Now things that happen to a man against his will, can be removed from him against his will, as in the case of the goods of fortune. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> can be removed from a man against his will.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">Evil</a> of fault and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of punishment differ in this, that the origin of fault is within us, since all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, whereas the origin of punishment is sometimes without, since punishment does not need to be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, in fact the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of punishment is rather to be against the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Wherefore, just as a man commits no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> except willingly, so no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is forgiven him against his will. On the other hand just as a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> can be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> against his will, so can he be <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> therefrom.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The assertion is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of those <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods which depend on our will, such as the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, which we cannot lose unwillingly; for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, although a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, can be lost by a man against his will through sickness. Hence the argument is not to the point.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is possible for <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> to be removed from a man even though he be contumacious, if it seem to be for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for whom the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> was intended as a medicine.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether a man can be absolved from one excommunication without being absolved from all?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a man cannot be <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> from one <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> without being <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> from all. For an effect should be proportionate to its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Since then a man cannot be <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> from one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> without being <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> from all, neither can this happen as regards <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> from <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> is pronounced in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But a man who is under the ban of one <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> is outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Therefore so long as one remains, a man cannot be loosed from another.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Excommunication is a punishment. Now a man can be loosed from one punishment, while another remains. Therefore a man can be loosed from one <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> and yet remain under another.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Excommunications are not connected together in any way, and so it is possible for a man to be <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> from one, and yet remain under another.

<p>It must be observed however that sometimes a man lies under several excommunications pronounced by one judge; and then, when he is <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> from one, he is understood to be <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> from all, unless the contrary be expressed, or unless he ask to be <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> from <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> on one count only, whereas he was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> under several. On the other hand sometimes a man lies under several sentences of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> pronounced by several judges; and then, when <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> from one <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, he is not therefore <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> from the others, unless at his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> they all confirm his <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>, or unless they all depute one to <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> All <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are connected together in aversion from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is incompatible with the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: wherefore one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot be forgiven without another. But excommunications have no such connection. Nor again is <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> from <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> hindered by contrariety of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Hence the argument does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as such a man was for several reasons outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> so is it possible for his separation to be removed on one count and to remain on another.
