<h1>Question 24. Good and evil in the passions of the soul</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2024.htm#article1"> Can moral good and evil be found in the passions of the soul?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2024.htm#article2"> Is every passion of the soul morally evil?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2024.htm#article3"> Does every passion increase or decrease the goodness or malice of an act?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2024.htm#article4"> Is any passion good or evil specifically?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether moral good and evil can be found in the passions of the soul?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that no <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is morally <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For moral <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> are proper to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: since "morals are properly predicated of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," as <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (Super Luc. Prolog.). But <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are not proper to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, for he has them in common with other animals. Therefore no <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is morally <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> consists in "being in accord, or in disaccord with reason," as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv). Now the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are not in the reason, but in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, as stated above (Question 22, Article 3). Therefore they have no connection with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, i.e. moral, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 5) that "we are neither praised nor blamed for our <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>." But we are praised and blamed for moral <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are not morally <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 7) while speaking of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: "They are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> if our love is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> if our love is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We may consider the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in two ways: first, in themselves; secondly, as being subject to the command of the reason and will. If then the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> be considered in themselves, to wit, as movements of the irrational <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, thus there is no moral <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in them, since this depends on the reason, as stated above (18, 05). If, however, they be considered as subject to the command of the reason and will, then moral <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> are in them. Because the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is nearer than the outward members to the reason and will; and yet the movements and actions of the outward members are morally <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, inasmuch as they are <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. Much more, therefore, may the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, in so far as they are <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, be called morally <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And they are said to be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, either from being commanded by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, or from not being checked by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> These <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, considered in themselves, are common to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and other animals: but, as commanded by the reason, they are proper to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Even the lower appetitive powers are called rational, in so far as "they partake of reason in some sort" (Ethic. i, 13).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says that we are neither praised nor blamed for our <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> considered absolutely; but he does not exclude their becoming worthy of praise or blame, in so far as they are subordinate to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Hence he continues: "For the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> or is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, is not praised . . . or blamed, but the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> in a certain way, i.e. according to, or against <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether every passion of the soul is evil morally?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that all the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are morally <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei ix, 4) that "some call the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> diseases or disturbances of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>" [Those things which the Greeks call <em>pathe</em>, we prefer to call disturbances rather than diseases (Tusc. iv. 5)]. But every disease or disturbance of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is morally <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore every <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> morally.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 22) that "movement in accord with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is an action, but movement contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is passion." But in movements of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, what is against <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> and morally <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: hence he says elsewhere (De Fide Orth. ii, 4) that "the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> turned from that which is in accord with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to that which is against <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." Therefore these <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are morally <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whatever leads to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, has an aspect of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But these <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> lead to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: wherefore they are called "the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse5">Romans 7:5</a>). Therefore it seems that they are morally <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 9) that "all these emotions are right in those whose love is rightly placed . . . For they fear to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, they desire to persevere; they grieve for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, they rejoice in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> On this question the opinion of the Stoics differed from that of the Peripatetics: for the Stoics held that all <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, while the Peripatetics maintained that moderate <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. This difference, although it appears great in words, is nevertheless, in reality, none at all, or but little, if we consider the intent of either school. For the Stoics did not discern between sense and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; and consequently neither between the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Hence they did not discriminate the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the movements of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, in so far as the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, while the simple movements of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> are in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>: but every rational movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> part they call will, while they called passion, a movement that exceeds the limits of reason. Wherefore Cicero, following their opinion (De Tusc. Quaest. iii, 4) calls all <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> "diseases of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>": whence he argues that "those who are diseased are unsound; and those who are unsound are wanting in sense." Hence we speak of those who are wanting in sense of being "unsound."

<p>On the other hand, the Peripatetics give the name of "<a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>" to all the movements of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Wherefore they esteem them <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, when they are controlled by reason; and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> when they are not controlled by reason. Hence it is evident that Cicero was wrong in disapproving (De Tusc. Quaest. iii, 4) of the Peripatetic theory of a mean in the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, when he says that "every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, though moderate, should be shunned; for, just as a body, though it be moderately ailing, is not sound; so, this mean in the diseases or <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, is not sound." For <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are not called "diseases" or "disturbances" of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, save when they are not controlled by reason.

<p>Hence the reply to the First Objection is evident.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In every <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> there is an increase or decrease in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> movement of the heart, according as the heart is moved more or less intensely by contraction and dilatation; and hence it derives the character of passion. But there is no need for passion to deviate always from the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in so far as they are contrary to the order of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, incline us to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: but in so far as they are controlled by reason, they pertain to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether passion increases or decreases the goodness or malice of an act?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that every <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> decreases the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of a moral action. For anything that hinders the judgment of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, on which depends the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of a moral act, consequently decreases the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the moral act. But every <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> hinders the judgment of reason: for Sallust says (Catilin.): "All those that take counsel about matters of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, should be free from <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, friendship and pity." Therefore passion decreases the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of a moral act.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the more a man's action is like to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the better it is: hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse1">Ephesians 5:1</a>): "Be ye followers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as most dear children." But "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> feel no <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> when they punish . . . no fellow-feeling with misery when they relieve the unhappy," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei ix, 5). Therefore it is better to do such like <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> without than with a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as moral <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> depends on its relation to reason, so also does moral <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But moral <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is lessened by passion: for he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> less, who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> from passion, than he who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> deliberately. Therefore he does a better <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, who does well without passion, than he who does with passion.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei ix, 5) that "the passion of pity is obedient to reason, when pity is bestowed without violating right, as when the poor are relieved, or the penitent forgiven." But nothing that is obedient to reason lessens the moral <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not lessen moral <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As the Stoics held that every <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, they consequently held that every <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> lessens the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of an act; since the admixture of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> either destroys <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> altogether, or makes it to be less <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. And this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> indeed, if by <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> we understand none but the inordinate movements of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, considered as disturbances or ailments. But if we give the name of <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> to all the movements of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, then it belongs to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that his <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> be moderated by reason. For since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is founded on reason as its root, that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will be all the more perfect, according as it extends to more things pertaining to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Wherefore no one questions the fact that it belongs to the perfection of moral <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, that the actions of the outward members be controlled by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of reason. Hence, since the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> can obey reason, as stated above (Question 17, Article 7), it belongs to the perfection of moral or <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> themselves also should be controlled by reason.

<p>Accordingly just as it is better that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should both will <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and do it in his external act; so also does it belong to the perfection of moral <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be moved unto <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, not only in respect of his will, but also in respect of his sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; according to <a href="../bible/psa083.htm#verse3">Psalm 83:3</a>: "My heart and my flesh have rejoiced in the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>": where by "heart" we are to understand the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, and by "flesh" the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may stand in a twofold relation to the judgment of reason. First, antecedently: and thus, since they obscure the judgment of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, on which the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the moral act depends, they diminish the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the act; for it is more praiseworthy to do a work of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> from the judgment of reason than from the mere passion of pity. In the second place, consequently: and this in two ways. First, by way of redundance: because, to wit, when the higher part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is intensely moved to anything, the lower part also follows that movement: and thus the passion that results in consequence, in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, is a sign of the intensity of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and so indicates greater moral <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Secondly, by way of choice; when, to wit, a man, by the judgment of his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, chooses to be affected by a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> in order to work more promptly with the co-operation of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. And thus a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> increases the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of an action.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> there is no sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, nor again bodily members: and so in them <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> does not depend on the right ordering of <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> or of bodily actions, as it does in us.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A passion that tends to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and precedes the judgment of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, diminishes <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but if it be consequent in either of the ways mentioned above (Reply to Objection 1), it aggravates the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or else it is a sign of its being more grievous.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether any passion is good or evil in its species?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that no passion of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> morally according to its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Because moral <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> depend on reason. But the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; so that accordance with reason is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to them. Since, therefore, nothing <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> belongs to a thing's <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, it seems that no passion is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> according to its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, acts and <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> take their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from their object. If, therefore, any passion were <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, according to its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, it would follow that those <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> the object of which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, are specifically <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, such as love, desire and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>: and that those <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, the object of which is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, are specifically <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, fear and sadness. But this is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Therefore no passion is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> according to its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, there is no <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of passion that is not to be found in other animals. But moral <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> alone. Therefore no passion of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> according to its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei ix, 5) that "pity is a kind of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>." Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 7) that modesty is a praiseworthy passion. Therefore some <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> according to their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We ought, seemingly, to apply to <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> what has been said in regard to acts (18, 5,6; 20, 1)--viz. that the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of an act, can be considered from two points of view. First, according to its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> genus; and thus moral <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> have no connection with the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of an act or passion. Secondly, according to its moral genus, inasmuch as it is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> and controlled by reason. In this way moral <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> can belong to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, in so far as the object to which a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> tends, is, of itself, in harmony or in discord with reason: as is clear in the case of "shame" which is base fear; and of "<a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>" which is sorrow for another's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: for thus <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> belong to the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> as the external act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument considers the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> in their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, in so far as the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is considered in itself. But in so far as the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> obeys reason, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of reason are no longer <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, but <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Passions having a tendency to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, are themselves <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, if they tend to that which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and in like manner, if they turn away from that which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. On the other hand, those <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> which consist in aversion from <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and a tendency to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, are themselves <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In irrational animals the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> does not obey reason. Nevertheless, in so far as they are led by a kind of estimative power, which is subject to a higher, i.e. the Divine reason, there is a certain likeness of moral <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in them, in regard to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.
