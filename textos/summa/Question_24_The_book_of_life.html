<h1>Question 24. The book of life</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1024.htm#article1"> What is the book of life?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1024.htm#article2"> Of what life is it the book?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1024.htm#article3"> Can anyone be blotted out of the book of life?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the book of life is the same as predestination?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the book of life is not the same thing as pre-destination. For it is said, "All things are the book of life" (<a href="../bible/sir004.htm#verse32">Sirach 4:32</a>)--i.e. the Old and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a>. This, however, is not <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>. Therefore the book of life is not <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xx, 14) that "the book of life is a certain divine energy, by which it happens that to each one his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> works are recalled to <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>." But divine energy belongs seemingly, not to <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, but rather to divine power. Therefore the book of life is not the same thing as <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, reprobation is opposed to <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>. So, if the book of life were the same as <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, there should also be a book of death, as there is a book of life.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said in a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> upon <a href="../bible/psa068.htm#verse29">Psalm 68:29</a>, "Let them be blotted out of the book of the living. This book is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by which He hath predestined to life those whom He foreknew."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The book of life is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> taken in a metaphorical sense, according to a comparison with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs. For it is usual among men that they who are chosen for any office should be inscribed in a book; as, for instance, soldiers, or counsellors, who formerly were called "conscript" fathers. Now it is clear from the preceding (23, 4) that all the predestined are chosen by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to possess <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>. This conscription, therefore, of the predestined is called the book of life. A thing is said metaphorically to be written upon the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of anyone when it is firmly held in the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, according to <a href="../bible/pro003.htm#verse3">Proverbs 3:3</a>: "Forget not My Law, and let thy heart keep My commandments," and further on, "Write them in the tables of thy heart." For things are written down in material books to help the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>. Whence, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by which He firmly remembers that He has predestined some to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, is called the book of life. For as the writing in a book is the sign of things to be done, so the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a sign in Him of those who are to be brought to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, according to <a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse19">2 Timothy 2:19</a>: "The sure foundation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> standeth firm, having this seal; the Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> who are His."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The book of life may be understood in two senses. In one sense as the inscription of those who are chosen to life; thus we now speak of the book of life. In another sense the inscription of those things which lead us to life may be called the book of life; and this also is twofold, either as of things to be done; and thus the Old and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> are called a book of life; or of things already done, and thus that divine energy by which it happens that to each one his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> will be recalled to <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, is spoken of as the book of life. Thus that also may be called the book of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, whether it contains the names inscribed of those chosen for military service; or treats of the art of warfare, or relates the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of soldiers. Hence the solution of the Second Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is the custom to inscribe, not those who are rejected, but those who are chosen. Whence there is no book of death corresponding to reprobation; as the book of life to <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Predestination and the book of life are different aspects of the same thing. For this latter implies the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>; as also is made clear from the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> quoted above.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the book of life regards only the life of glory of the predestined?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the book of life does not only regard the life of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the predestined. For the book of life is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of life. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, through His own life, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all other life. Therefore the book of life is so called in regard to divine life; and not only in regard to the life of the predestined.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as the life of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> comes from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so also does the life of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore, if the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the life of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is called the book of life; so also should the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the life of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> be so called.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, some are chosen to the life of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> who are not chosen to the life of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; as it is clear from what is said: "Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>?" (<a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse71">John 6:71</a>). But the book of life is the inscription of the divine election, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore it applies also to the life of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The book of life is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). But <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> does not regard the life of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, except so far as it is directed to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; for those are not predestined who have <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and yet fail to obtain <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. The book of life altogether is only so called in regard to the life of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The book of life, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), implies a conscription or a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of those chosen to life. Now a man is chosen for something which does not belong to him by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and again that to which a man is chosen has the aspect of an end. For a soldier is not chosen or inscribed merely to put on armor, but to fight; since this is the proper <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to which military service is directed. But the life of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is an end exceeding <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as said above (Question 23, Article 1). Wherefore, strictly speaking, the book of life regards the life of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The divine life, even considered as a life of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; whence in His regard there is no election, and in consequence no book of life: for we do not say that anyone is chosen to possess the power of sense, or any of those things that are consequent on <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p>From this we gather the Reply to the Second Objection. For there is no election, nor a book of life, as regards the life of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The life of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> has the aspect, not of an end, but of something directed towards an end. Hence nobody is said to be chosen to the life of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, except so far as the life of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is directed to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. For this reason those who, possessing <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, fail to obtain <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, are not said to be chosen simply, but relatively. Likewise they are not said to be written in the book of life simply, but relatively; that is to say, that it is in the ordination and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that they are to have some relation to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, according to their participation in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether anyone may be blotted out of the book of life?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that no one may be blotted out of the book of life. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xx, 15): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> foreknowledge, which cannot be deceived, is the book of life." But nothing can be taken away from the foreknowledge of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor from <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>. Therefore neither can anyone be blotted out from the book of life.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever is in a thing is in it according to the disposition of that thing. But the book of life is something <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and immutable. Therefore whatsoever is written therein, is there not in a temporary way, but immovably, and indelibly.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, blotting out is the contrary to inscription. But nobody can be written a second time in the book of life. Neither therefore can he be blotted out.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said, "Let them be blotted out from the book of the living" (<a href="../bible/psa068.htm#verse29">Psalm 68:29</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some have said that none could be blotted out of the book of life as a matter of fact, but only in the opinion of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. For it is customary in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> to say that something is done when it becomes <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Thus some are said to be written in the book of life, inasmuch as men think they are written therein, on account of the present righteousness they see in them; but when it becomes evident, either in this world or in the next, that they have fallen from that state of righteousness, they are then said to be blotted out. And thus a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> explains the passage: "Let them be blotted out of the book of the living." But because not to be blotted out of the book of life is placed among the rewards of the just, according to the text, "He that shall overcome, shall thus be clothed in white garments, and I will not blot his name out of the book of life" (<a href="../bible/rev003.htm#verse5">Apocalypse 3:5</a>) (and what is promised to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, is not merely something in the opinion of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>), it can therefore be said that to be blotted out, and not blotted out, of the book of life is not only to be referred to the opinion of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but to the reality of the fact. For the book of life is the inscription of those ordained to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, to which one is directed from two sources; namely, from <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, which direction never fails, and from <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; for whoever has <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, by this very fact becomes fitted for <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>. This direction fails sometimes; because some are directed by possessing <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, to obtain <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, yet they fail to obtain it through mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore those who are ordained to possess <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> through divine <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> are written down in the book of life simply, because they are written therein to have <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> in reality; such are never blotted out from the book of life. Those, however, who are ordained to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, not through divine <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, but through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, are said to be written in the book of life not simply, but relatively, for they are written therein not to have <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> in itself, but in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> only. Yet though these latter can be said to be blotted out of the book of life, this blotting out must not be referred to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> foreknew a thing, and afterwards <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it not; but to the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, namely, because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> one is first ordained to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, and afterwards not ordained when he falls from <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The act of blotting out does not refer to the book of life as regards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> foreknowledge, as if in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there were any change; but as regards things foreknown, which can change.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although things are immutably in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet in themselves they are subject to change. To this it is that the blotting out of the book of life refers.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The way in which one is said to be blotted out of the book of life is that in which one is said to be written therein anew; either in the opinion of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, or because he begins again to have relation towards <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; which also is included in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, although not anew.
