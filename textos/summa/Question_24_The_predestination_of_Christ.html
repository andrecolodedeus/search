<h1>Question 24. The predestination of Christ</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/4024.htm#article1"> Was Christ predestinated?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4024.htm#article2"> Was He predestinated as man?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4024.htm#article3"> Is His predestination the exemplar of ours?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4024.htm#article4"> Is it the cause of our predestination?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether it is befitting that Christ should be predestinated?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem unfitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should be <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>. For the term of anyone's <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> seems to be the adoption of sons, according to <a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse5">Ephesians 1:5</a>: "Who hath <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> us unto the adoption of children." But it is not befitting to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be an adopted Son, as stated above (Question 23, Article 4). Therefore it is not fitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> be <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, we may consider two things in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and His <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. But it cannot be said that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> by reason of His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; for this proposition is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>--"The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>." In like manner neither by reason of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; for this <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, not by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: whereas <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> regards what is of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as stated in I, 23, 2,5. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as that which has been made was not always, so also that which was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>; since <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> implies a certain antecedence. But, because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was always <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, it cannot be said that that Man was "made the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>." Therefore, for a like reason, we ought not to say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was "<a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says, speaking of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse4">Romans 1:4</a>): "Who was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> in power."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As is clear from what has been said in I, 23, 1,2, <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, in its proper sense, is a certain Divine preordination from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of those things which are to be done in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, is something done in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of union. Nor can it be said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has not from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> pre-ordained to do this in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>: since it would follow that something would come anew into the Divine Mind. And we must needs admit that the union itself of natures in the Person of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> falls under the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For this reason do we say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> there speaks of that <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> by which we are <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to be adopted sons. And just as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in a singular manner above all others is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, so in a singular manner is He <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> [From <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, De Praed. Sanct. xv] says on <a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse4">Romans 1:4</a>, some understood that <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> to refer to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and not to the Person--that is to say, that on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was bestowed the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of being united to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> in unity of Person.

<p>But in that case the phrase of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> would be improper, for two reasons. First, for a general reason: for we do not speak of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but of his <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, as being <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>: because to be <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> is to be directed towards <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, which belongs to a suppositum acting for the end of beatitude. Secondly, for a special reason. Because to be <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is not befitting to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; for this proposition is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>": unless one were to force from it such an exposition as: "Who was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> in power"--that is, "It was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> should be united to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> in the Person."

<p>Hence we must attribute <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> to the Person of Christ: not, indeed, in Himself or as subsisting in the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, but as subsisting in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>, after saying, "Who was made to Him of the seed of David according to the flesh," added, "Who was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> in power": so as to give us to understand that in respect of His being of the seed of David according to the flesh, He was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> in power. For although it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to that Person, considered in Himself, to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> in power, yet this is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to Him, considered in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, in respect of which this befits Him according to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of union.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse4">Romans 1:4</a> says that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> reading of this passage of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> is: "Who was destined to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> in power"; so that no antecedence is implied. And so there would be no difficulty. Others refer the antecedence implied in the participle "<a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>," not to the fact of being the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, but to the manifestation thereof, according to the customary way of speaking in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Scripture</a>, by which things are said to take place when they are made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; so that the sense would be--"<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>." But this is an improper signification of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>. For a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is properly said to be <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> by reason of his being directed to the end of beatitude: but the beatitude of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> does not depend on our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> thereof.

<p>It is therefore better to say that the antecedence implied in the participle "<a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>" is to be referred to the Person not in Himself, but by reason of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: since, although that Person was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, it was not always <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that one subsisting in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Praedest. Sanct. xv): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>, so that He Who according to the flesh was to be the son of David, should be nevertheless <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> in power."

<p>Moreover, it must be observed that, although the participle "<a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>," just as this participle "made," implies antecedence, yet there is a difference. For "to be made" belongs to the thing in itself: whereas "to be <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>" belongs to someone as being in the apprehension of one who pre-ordains. Now that which is the subject of a form or <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in reality, can be apprehended either as under that form or absolutely. And since it cannot be said absolutely of the Person of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> that He began to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, yet this is becoming to Him as understood or apprehended to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, because at one time it began to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; therefore this proposition--"<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>"--is truer than this--"<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was made the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether this proposition is false: "Christ as man was predestinated to be the Son of God"?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that this proposition is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>." For at some time a man is that which he was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to be: since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> does not fail. If, therefore, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, it seems to follow that as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> He is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. But the latter is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Therefore the former is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, what is befitting to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is befitting to any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; since He belongs to the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> as other men. If, therefore, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, it will follow that this is befitting to any other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But the latter is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Therefore the former is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that is <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> which is to take place at some time. But this proposition, "The <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," is truer than this, "Man was made the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>." Therefore this proposition, "Christ, as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to be <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," is truer than this, "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Man was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Praedest. Sanct. xv) says: "Forasmuch as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Son was made Man, we say that the Lord of Glory was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Two things may be considered in <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>. One on the part of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> itself: and in this respect it implies a certain antecedence in regard to that which comes under <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>. Secondly, <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> may be considered as regards its temporal effect, which is some gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore from both points of view we must say that <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by reason of His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> alone: for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was not always united to the Word; and by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> bestowed an it was it united in Person to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Consequently, by reason of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> alone can <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> be attributed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Praedest. Sanct. xv): "This <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of ours was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to be raised to so great, so lofty, so exalted a position, that it would be impossible to raise it higher." Now that is said to belong to anyone as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> which belongs to him by reason of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Consequently, we must say that "Christ, as Man, was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> When we say, "Christ, as Man, was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>," this qualification, "as Man," can be referred in two ways to the action signified by the participle. First, as regards what comes under <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> materially, and thus it is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. For the sense would be that it was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as Man, should be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. And in this sense the objection takes it.

<p>Secondly, it may be referred to the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the action itself: that is, forasmuch as <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> implies antecedence and gratuitous effect. And thus <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by reason of His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as stated above. And in this sense He is said to be <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> as Man.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Something may be befitting to a man by reason of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, in two ways. First, so that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> thereof: thus risibility is befitting to <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> by reason of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, being <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by its principles. In this manner <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is not befitting either to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> or to any other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, by reason of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. This is the sense of the objection. Secondly, a thing may be befitting to someone by reason of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is susceptible of it. And in this sense we say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> by reason of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; because <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> refers to the exaltation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in Him, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Praedest. Sanct. xv): "The <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> assumed Man to Himself in such a singular and ineffable manner that at the same time He may be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> and correctly called the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, because He assumed Men to Himself; and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, because it was the Only-begotten of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who assumed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." Consequently, since this assumption comes under <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> by reason of its being gratuitous, we can say both that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to be <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and that the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. But because <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was not bestowed on the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> that He might be <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but rather on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, that it might be united to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; it is more proper to say that "Christ, as Man, was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>," than that, "Christ, as <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to be Man."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether Christ's predestination is the exemplar of ours?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is not the exemplar of ours. For the exemplar <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> before the exemplate. But nothing <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> before the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. Since, therefore, our <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is not the exemplar of ours.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the exemplar leads us to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the exemplate. But there was no need for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be led from something else to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of our <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>; since it is written (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse29">Romans 8:29</a>): "Whom He foreknew, He also <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is not the exemplar of ours.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the exemplar is conformed to the exemplate. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> seems to be of a different <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> from ours: because we are <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to the sonship of adoption, whereas <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> "<a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> in power," as is written (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse4">Romans 1:4</a>). Therefore His <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is not the exemplar of ours.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Praedest. Sanct. xv): "The Saviour Himself, the Mediator of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and men, the Man <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a> is the most splendid light of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>." Now He is called the light of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, inasmuch as our <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is made manifest by His <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; and this seems to pertain to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an exemplar. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is the exemplar of ours.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Predestination may be considered in two ways. First, on the part of the act of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>: and thus <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> cannot be said to be the exemplar of ours: for in the same way and by the same <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> act <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> us and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p>Secondly, <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> may be considered on the part of that to which anyone is <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>, and this is the term and effect of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>. In this sense <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is the exemplar of ours, and this in two ways. First, in respect of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to which we are <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>: for He was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to be the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, whereas we are <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to the adoption of sons, which is a participated likeness of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> sonship. Whence it is written (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse29">Romans 8:29</a>): "Whom He foreknew, He also <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to be made conformable to the image of His Son." Secondly, in respect of the manner of obtaining this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>--that is, by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. This is most manifest in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in Him, without any antecedent <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, was united to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>: and of the fulness of His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> we all have received, as it is written (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse16">John 1:16</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument considers the aforesaid act of the predestinator.

<p>The same is to be said of the second objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The exemplate need not be conformed to the exemplar in all respects: it is sufficient that it imitate it in some.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether Christ's predestination is the cause of ours?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of ours. For that which is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> has no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But our <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of ours.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which depends on the simple will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has no other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will. Now, our <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> depends on the simple will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for it is written (<a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse11">Ephesians 1:11</a>): "Being <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> according to the purpose of Him, Who worketh all things according to the counsel of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of ours.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> be taken away, the effect is also taken away. But if we take away <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, ours is not taken away; since even if the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> were not <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>, our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> might yet have been achieved in a different manner, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiii, 10). Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is. not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of ours.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse5">Ephesians 1:5</a>): "(Who) hath <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> us unto the adoption of children through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> if we consider <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> on the part of the very act of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinating</a>, then <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of ours; because by one and the same act <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> both <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and us. But if we consider <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> on the part of its term, thus <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of ours: for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinating</a> from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, so decreed our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, that it should be achieved through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. For <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> covers not only that which is to be accomplished in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, but also the mode and order in which it is to be accomplished in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>.

<p><strong>Replies to Objections 1 and 2.</strong> These arguments consider <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> on the part of the act of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinating</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> were not to have been <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would have decreed men's <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by other means. But since He decreed the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, He decreed at the same time that He should be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.
