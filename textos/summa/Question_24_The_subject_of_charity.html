<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the will is the subject of charity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not the subject of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is a kind of love. Now, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Topic. ii, 3) love is in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> part. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is also in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> and not in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is the foremost of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as stated above (Question 23, Article 6). But the reason is the subject of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is in the reason and not in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> extends to all <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co016.htm#verse14">1 Corinthians 16:14</a>: "Let all your things be done in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>." Now the principle of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is chiefly in the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> as its subject and not in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The object of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is also the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as its subject.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since, as stated in I, 80, 2, the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is twofold, namely the sensitive, and the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> which is called the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, the object of each is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but in different ways: for the object of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> apprehended by sense, whereas the object of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> or <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> under the universal aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, according as it can be apprehended by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Now the object of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not a sensible <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> alone. Therefore the subject of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not the sensitive, but the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> is a part of the sensitive, not of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in I, 81, 2: wherefore the love which is in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>, is the love of sensible <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: nor can the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> reach to the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is an intelligible <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> alone can. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> cannot be the subject of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Anima iii, 9), the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> also is in the reason: wherefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not excluded from the reason through being in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Yet <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is regulated, not by the reason, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are, but by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> wisdom, and transcends the rule of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, according to <a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse19">Ephesians 3:19</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which surpasseth all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>." Hence it is not in the reason, either as its subject, like <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is, or as its rule, like <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> are, but only by a certain kinship of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to the reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated in I, 83, 4, the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is not a distinct power from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Yet <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> considered as <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, the act of which is to choose. For choice is of things directed to the end, whereas the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is of the end itself (Ethic. iii, 2). Hence <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, whose object is the last end, should be described as residing in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> rather than in the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether charity is caused in us by infusion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in us by infusion. For that which is common to all creatures, is in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>. Now, according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. iv), the "Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>", which is the object of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, "is for all an object of dilection and love." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is in us <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, and not by infusion.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the more lovable a thing is the easier it is to love it. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is supremely lovable, since He is supremely <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore it is easier to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him than other things. But we need no infused <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> in order to love other things. Neither, therefore, do we need one in order to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse5">1 Timothy 1:5</a>): "The end of the commandment is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> from a pure heart, and a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and an unfeigned <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>." Now these three have reference to <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in us from preceding acts, and not from infusion.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans 5:5</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is poured forth in our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, Who is given to us."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 23, Article 1), <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is a friendship of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, founded upon the fellowship of everlasting <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Now this fellowship is in respect, not of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, but of gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, for, according to <a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse23">Romans 6:23</a>, "the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is life everlasting": wherefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> itself surpasses our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> facilities. Now that which surpasses the faculty of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, cannot be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> or acquired by the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers, since a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> effect does not transcend its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p>Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> can be in us neither <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, nor through acquisition by the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers, but by the infusion of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, Who is the love of the Father and the Son, and the participation of Whom in us is <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as stated above (Question 23, Article 2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> is speaking of the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is founded on the fellowship of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> goods, wherefore it is in all <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is founded on a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> fellowship, so the comparison fails.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is supremely knowable in Himself yet not to us, on account of a defect in our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which depends on sensible things, so too, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is supremely lovable in Himself, in as much as He is the object of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. But He is not supremely lovable to us in this way, on account of the inclination of our <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> towards visible goods. Hence it is evident that for us to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> above all things in this way, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> be infused into our hearts.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> When it is said that in us <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> proceeds from "a pure heart, and a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and an unfeigned <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>," this must be referred to the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> which is aroused by these things. Or again, this is said because the aforesaid acts dispose <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to receive the infusion of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. The same remark applies to the saying of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Tract. ix in prim. canon. Joan.): "Fear leads to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>," and of a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse2">Matthew 1:2</a>: "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> begets hope, and hope <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether charity is infused according to the capacity of our natural gifts?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is infused according to the capacity of our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse15">Matthew 25:15</a>) that "He gave to every one according to his own <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'proper ability']." Now, in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, none but <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> precedes <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, since there is no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as stated above (Question 23, Article 7). Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> infuses <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> into <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> according to the measure of his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, among things ordained towards one another, the second is proportionate to the first: thus we find in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things that the form is proportionate to the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and in gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is proportionate to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Now, since <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is a perfection of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it is compared to the capacity of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as second to first. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is infused according to the capacity of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, men and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> partake of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> according to the same measure, since <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is alike in both, according to <a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse30">Matthew 22:30</a> and <a href="../bible/luk020.htm#verse36">Luke 20:36</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and other gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are bestowed on the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, according to their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> capacity, as the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> teaches (Sent. ii, D, 3). Therefore the same apparently applies to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse8">John 3:8</a>): "The Spirit breatheth where He will," and (<a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse11">1 Corinthians 12:11</a>): "All these things one and the same Spirit worketh, dividing to every one according as He will." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is given, not according to our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> capacity, but according as the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> wills to distribute His <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of a thing depends on the proper <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of that thing, since the more universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> produces a greater effect. Now, since <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> surpasses the proportion of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>) it depends, not on any <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but on the sole <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> Who infuses <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> depends neither on the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> nor on the capacity of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but only on the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> Who "divides" His <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> "according as He will." Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse7">Ephesians 4:7</a>): "To every one of us is given <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> according to the measure of the giving of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in accordance with which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gives His <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> to each one, is a disposition or previous preparation or effort of the one who receives <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> forestalls even this disposition or effort, by moving <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> mind either more or less, according as He will. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse12">Colossians 1:12</a>): "Who hath made us worthy to be partakers of the lot of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in light."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The form does not surpass the proportion of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. On like manner <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> are referred to the same genus, for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is nothing else than a beginning of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in us. But <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> do not belong to the same genus, so that the comparison fails.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> is an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and it is consistent with his <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> that he should be borne wholly whithersoever he is borne, as stated in I, 61, 6. Hence there was a greater effort in the higher <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, both for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in those who persevered, and for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in those who fell, and consequently those of the higher <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who remained steadfast became better than the others, and those who fell became worse. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> is a rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, with which it is consistent to be sometimes in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> and sometimes in act: so that it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> borne wholly whithersoever it is borne, and where there are greater <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> there may be less effort, and vice versa. Thus the comparison fails.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether charity can increase?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> cannot increase. For nothing increases save what has <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> is twofold, namely dimensive and virtual. The former does not befit <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> which is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> perfection, while virtual <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> regards the objects in respect of which <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> does not increase, since the slightest <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> loves all that is to be loved out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> does not increase.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which consists in something extreme receives no increase. But <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> consists in something extreme, being the greatest of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and the supreme love of the greatest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> cannot increase.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, increase is a kind of movement. Therefore wherever there is increase there is movement, and if there be increase of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> there is movement of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Now there is no movement of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> save either by corruption or generation. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> cannot increase <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, unless it happen to be generated anew or corrupted, which is unreasonable.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. lxxiv in Joan.) [Cf. Ep. clxxxv.] that "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> increase that by increase it may <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> perfection."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of a wayfarer can increase. For we are called wayfarers by reason of our being on the way to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is the last end of our <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. On this way we advance as we get nigh to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is approached, "not by steps of the body but by the affections of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>" [<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, Tract. in Joan. xxxii]: and this approach is the result of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, since it unites <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> mind to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Consequently it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of a wayfarer that it can increase, for if it could not, all further advance along the way would cease. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> calls <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> the way, when he says (<a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse31">1 Corinthians 12:31</a>): "I show unto you yet a more excellent way."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> is not subject to dimensive, but only to virtual <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>: and the latter depends not only on the number of objects, namely whether they be in greater number or of greater excellence, but also on the intensity of the act, namely whether a thing is loved more, or less; it is in this way that the virtual <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> increases.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> consists in an extreme with regard to its object, in so far as its object is the Supreme Good, and from this it follows that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is the most excellent of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Yet not every <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> consists in an extreme, as regards the intensity of the act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Some have said that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> does not increase in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, but only as to its radication in its subject, or according to its fervor.

<p>But these people did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what they were talking about. For since <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, its being is to be in something. So that an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> increase of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> means nothing else but that it is yet more in its subject, which implies a greater radication in its subject. Furthermore, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> ordained to act, so that an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> increase of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> implies ability to produce an act of more fervent love. Hence <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> increases <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, not by beginning anew, or ceasing to be in its subject, as the objection imagines, but by beginning to be more and more in its subject.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether charity increases by addition?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> increases by addition. For just as increase may be in respect of bodily <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, so may it be according to virtual <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. Now increase in bodily <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> results from addition; for the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Gener. i, 5) that "increase is addition to pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> magnitude." Therefore the increase of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> which is according to virtual <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> is by addition.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is a kind of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> light in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse10">1 John 2:10</a>: "He that loveth his brother abideth in the light." Now light increases in the air by addition; thus the light in a house increases when another candle is lit. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> also increases in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by addition.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the increase of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> work, even as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> of it, according to <a href="../bible/2co009.htm#verse10">2 Corinthians 9:10</a>: "He will increase the growth of the fruits of your <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>." Now when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> first infuses <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, He puts something in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that was not there before. Therefore also, when He increases <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, He puts something there which was not there before. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> increases by addition.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> is a simple form. Now nothing greater results from the addition of one simple thing to another, as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in Phys. iii, text. 59, and Metaph. ii, 4. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> does not increase by addition.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Every addition is of something to something else: so that in every addition we must at least presuppose that the things added together are distinct before the addition. Consequently if <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> be added to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, the added <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> must be presupposed as distinct from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> to which it is added, not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> by a distinction of reality, but at least by a distinction of thought. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is able to increase a bodily <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> by adding a magnitude which did not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> before, but was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> at that very moment; which magnitude, though not pre-existent in reality, is nevertheless capable of being distinguished from the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> to which it is added. Wherefore if <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> be added to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> we must presuppose the distinction, at least <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a>, of the one <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> from the other.

<p>Now distinction among forms is twofold: specific and numeric. Specific distinction of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> follows diversity of objects, while numeric distinction follows distinction of subjects. Consequently a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> may receive increase through extending to objects to which it did not extend before: thus the science of geometry increases in one who acquires <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of geometrical matters which he ignored hitherto. But this cannot be said of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, for even the slightest <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> extends to all that we have to love by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Hence the addition which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> an increase of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> cannot be understood, as though the added <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> were presupposed to be distinct specifically from that to which it is added.

<p>It follows therefore that if <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> be added to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, we must presuppose a numerical distinction between them, which follows a distinction of subjects: thus whiteness receives an increase when one white thing is added to another, although such an increase does not make a thing whiter. This, however, does not apply to the case in point, since the subject of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is none other than the rational mind, so that such like an increase of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> could only take place by one rational mind being added to another; which is impossible. Moreover, even if it were possible, the result would be a greater lover, but not a more <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> one. It follows, therefore, that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> can by no means increase by addition of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as some have held to be the case.

<p>Accordingly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> increases only by its subject partaking of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> more and more subject thereto. For this is the proper mode of increase in a form that is intensified, since the being of such a form consists wholly in its adhering to its subject. Consequently, since the magnitude of a thing follows on its being, to say that a form is greater is the same as to say that it is more in its subject, and not that another form is added to it: for this would be the case if the form, of itself, had any <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, and not in comparison with its subject. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> increases by being intensified in its subject, and this is for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> to increase in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; and not by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> being added to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Bodily <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> has something as <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, and something else, in so far as it is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> form. As <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, it is distinguishable in respect of position or number, and in this way we have the increase of magnitude by addition, as may be seen in animals. But in so far as it is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> form, it is distinguishable only in respect of its subject, and in this way it has its proper increase, like other <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> forms, by way of intensity in its subject, for instance in things subject to rarefaction, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in Phys. iv, 9. On like manner science, as a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, has its <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> from its objects, and accordingly it increases by addition, when a man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> more things; and again, as an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> form, it has a certain <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> through being in its subject, and in this way it increase in a man who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the same scientific <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> with greater <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> now than before. On the same way <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> has a twofold <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>; but with regard to that which it has from its object, it does not increase, as stated above: hence it follows that it increases solely by being intensified.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The addition of light to light can be understood through the light being intensified in the air on account of there being several luminaries giving light: but this distinction does not apply to the case in point, since there is but one luminary shedding forth the light of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The infusion of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> denotes a change to the state of "having" <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> from the state of "not having it," so that something must needs come which was not there before. On the other hand, the increase of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> denotes a change to "more having" from "less having," so that there is need, not for anything to be there that was not there before, but for something to be more there that previously was less there. This is what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does when He increases <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, that is He makes it to have a greater hold on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and the likeness of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> to be more perfectly participated by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether charity increases through every act of charity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> increases through every <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For that which can do what is more, can do what is less. But every <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> can <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> everlasting life; and this is more than a simple addition of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, since it includes the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Much more, therefore, does every <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> increase <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of acquired <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are engendered by acts, so too an increase of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Now each <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> act conduces to the engendering of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore also each <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> conduces to the increase of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> [<a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>, Serm. ii in Festo Purif.] says that "to stand still in the way to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is to go back." Now no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> goes back when he is moved by an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore whoever is moved by an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> goes forward in the way to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> increases through every <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The effect does not surpass the power of its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is sometimes done with tepidity or slackness. Therefore it does not conduce to a more excellent <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, rather does it dispose one to a lower degree.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> increase of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is somewhat like the increase of a body. Now bodily increase in animals and plants is not a continuous movement, so that, to wit, if a thing increase so much in so much time, it need to increase proportionally in each part of that time, as happens in local movement; but for a certain space of time <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> works by disposing for the increase, without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> any actual increase, and afterwards brings into effect that to which it had disposed, by giving the animal or plant an actual increase. On like manner <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> does not actually increase through every <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, but each <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> disposes to an increase of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, in so far as one <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> makes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> more ready to act again according to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and this readiness increasing, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> breaks out into an act of more fervent love, and strives to advance in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and then his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> increases actually.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Every <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> everlasting life, which, however, is not to be bestowed then and there, but at its proper time. On like manner every <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> an increase of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; yet this increase does not take place at once, but when we strive for that increase.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Even when an acquired <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is being engendered, each act does not complete the formation of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but conduces towards that effect by disposing to it, while the last act, which is the most perfect, and acts in virtue of all those that preceded it, reduces the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> into act, just as when many drops hollow out a stone.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Man advances in the way to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not merely by actual increase of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, but also by being disposed to that increase.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether charity increases indefinitely?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> does not increase indefinitely. For every movement is towards some end and term, as stated in Metaph. ii, text. 8,9. But the increase of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is a movement. Therefore it tends to an end and term. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> does not increase indefinitely.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no form surpasses the capacity of its subject. But the capacity of the rational creature who is the subject of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is finite. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> cannot increase indefinitely.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every finite thing can, by continual increase, attain to the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of another finite thing however much greater, unless the amount of its increase be ever less and less. Thus the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Phys. iii, 6) that if we divide a line into an indefinite number of parts, and take these parts away and add them indefinitely to another line, we shall never arrive at any definite <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> resulting from those two lines, viz. the one from which we subtracted and the one to which we added what was subtracted. But this does not occur in the case in point: because there is no need for the second increase of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> to be less than the first, since rather is it probable that it would be equal or greater. As, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of the blessed is something finite, if the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of the wayfarer can increase indefinitely, it would follow that the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of the way can equal the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>; which is absurd. Therefore the wayfarer's <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> cannot increase indefinitely.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse12">Philippians 3:12</a>): "Not as though I had already attained, or were already perfect; but I follow after, if I may, by any means apprehend," on which words a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "Even if he has made great progress, let none of the faithful say: 'Enough.' For whosoever says this, leaves the road before coming to his destination." Therefore the wayfarer's <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> can ever increase more and more.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A term to the increase of a form may be fixed in three ways: first by reason of the form itself having a fixed measure, and when this has been reached it is no longer possible to go any further in that form, but if any further advance is made, another form is attained. And example of this is paleness, the bounds of which may, by continual alteration, be passed, either so that whiteness ensues, or so that blackness results. Secondly, on the part of the agent, whose power does not extend to a further increase of the form in its subject. Thirdly, on the part of the subject, which is not capable of ulterior perfection.

<p>Now, in none of these ways, is a limit imposed to the increase of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, while he is in the state of the wayfarer. For <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> itself considered as such has no limit to its increase, since it is a participation of the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> which is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. On like manner the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the increase of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, viz. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is possessed of <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power. Furthermore, on the part of its subject, no limit to this increase can be determined, because whenever <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> increases, there is a corresponding increased ability to receive a further increase. It is therefore evident that it is not possible to fix any limits to the increase of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> in this life.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The increase of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is directed to an end, which is not in this, but in a future life.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The capacity of the rational creature is increased by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, because the heart is enlarged thereby, according to <a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse11">2 Corinthians 6:11</a>: "Our heart is enlarged"; so that it still remains capable of receiving a further increase.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument holds good in those things which have the same kind of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, but not in those which have different kinds: thus however much a line may increase it does not reach the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of a superficies. Now the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of a wayfarer's <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> which follows the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not of the same kind as the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of the blessed, which follows open vision. Hence the argument does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether charity can be perfect in this life?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> cannot be perfect in this life. For this would have been the case with the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">apostles</a> before all others. Yet it was not so, since the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse12">Philippians 3:12</a>): "Not as though I had already attained, or were already perfect." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> cannot be perfect in this life.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Qq. lxxxiii, qu. 36) that "whatever kindles <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> quenches cupidity, but where <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is perfect, cupidity is done away altogether." But this cannot be in this world, wherein it is impossible to live without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#verse8">1 John 1:8</a>: "If we say that we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we deceive ourselves." Now all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> arises from some inordinate cupidity. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> cannot be perfect in this life.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, what is already perfect cannot be perfected any more.

<p>But in this life <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> can always increase, as stated above (<a href="#7">Article 7</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> cannot be perfect in this life.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (In prim. canon. Joan. Tract. v) "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> is perfected by being strengthened; and when it has been brought to perfection, it exclaims, 'I desire to be dissolved and to be with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.'" Now this is possible in this life, as in the case of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> can be perfect in this life.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The perfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> may be understood in two ways: first with regard to the object loved, secondly with regard to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who loves. With regard to the object loved, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is perfect, if the object be loved as much as it is lovable. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is as lovable as He is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, wherefore He is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> lovable.

<p>But no creature can <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> since all <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> power is finite. Consequently no creature's <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> can be perfect in this way; the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone can, whereby He loves Himself.

<p>On the part of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who loves, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is perfect, when he loves as much as he can. This happens in three ways. First, so that a man's whole heart is always actually borne towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: this is the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and is not possible in this life, wherein, by reason of the weakness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, it is impossible to think always actually of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to be moved by love towards Him. Secondly, so that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> makes an earnest endeavor to give his time to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Divine things, while scorning other things except in so far as the needs of the present life demand. This is the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> that is possible to a wayfarer; but is not common to all who have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Thirdly, so that a man gives his whole heart to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a>, viz. by neither thinking nor desiring anything contrary to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and this perfection is common to all who have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> denies that he has the perfection of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, wherefore a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on the same passage says that "he was a perfect wayfarer, but had not yet achieved the perfection to which the way leads."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This is said on account of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which are contrary, not to the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, but to the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: hence they are incompatible, not with the perfection of the way, but with that of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The perfection of the way is not perfection simply, wherefore it can always increase.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether charity is rightly distinguished into three degrees, beginning, progress, and perfection?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem unfitting to distinguish three degrees of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, beginning, progress, and perfection. For there are many degrees between the beginning of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and its ultimate perfection. Therefore it is not right to put only one.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> begins to progress as soon as it begins to be. Therefore we ought not to distinguish between <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> as progressing and as beginning.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in this world, however perfect a man's <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> may be, it can increase, as stated above (<a href="#7">Article 7</a>). Now for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> to increase is to progress. Therefore perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> ought not to be distinguished from progressing <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: and so the aforesaid degrees are unsuitably assigned to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (In prim. canon. Joan. Tract. v) "As soon as <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is born it takes food," which refers to beginners, "after taking food, it waxes strong," which refers to those who are progressing, "and when it has become strong it is perfected," which refers to the perfect. Therefore there are three degrees of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> increase of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> may be considered in respect of a certain likeness to the growth of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body. For although this latter growth may be divided into many parts, yet it has certain fixed divisions according to those particular actions or pursuits to which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is brought by this same growth. Thus we speak of a man being an infant until he has the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, after which we distinguish another state of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> wherein he begins to speak and to use his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, while there is again a third state, that of puberty when he begins to acquire the power of generation, and so on until he arrives at perfection.

<p>In like manner the divers degrees of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> are distinguished according to the different pursuits to which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is brought by the increase of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For at first it is incumbent on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to occupy himself chiefly with avoiding <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and resisting his <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a>, which move him in opposition to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: this concerns beginners, in whom <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> has to be fed or fostered lest it be destroyed: in the second place <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> chief pursuit is to aim at progress in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and this is the pursuit of the proficient, whose chief aim is to strengthen their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> by adding to it: while <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> third pursuit is to aim chiefly at union with and enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: this belongs to the perfect who "desire to be dissolved and to be with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>."

<p>In like manner we observe in local motion that at first there is withdrawal from one term, then approach to the other term, and thirdly, rest in this term.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> All these distinct degrees which can be discerned in the increase of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, are comprised in the aforesaid three, even as every division of continuous things is included in these three--the beginning, the middle, and the end, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (De Coelo i, 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although those who are beginners in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> may progress, yet the chief care that besets them is to resist the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which disturb them by their onslaught. Afterwards, however, when they come to feel this onslaught less, they begin to tend to perfection with greater security; yet with one hand doing the work, and with the other holding the sword as related in <a href="../bible/neh004.htm#verse17">Nehemiah 4:17</a> about those who built up Jerusalem.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Even the perfect make progress in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: yet this is not their chief care, but their aim is principally directed towards union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And though both the beginner and the proficient seek this, yet their solicitude is chiefly about other things, with the beginner, about avoiding <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, with the proficient, about progressing in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether charity can decrease?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> can decrease. For contraries by their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> affect the same subject. Now increase and decrease are contraries. Since then <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> increases, as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>), it seems that it can also decrease.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, speaking to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, says (Confess. x) "He loves Thee less, who loves aught besides Thee": and (Qq. lxxxiii, qu. 36) he says that "what kindles <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> quenches cupidity." For this it seems to follow that, on the contrary, what arouses cupidity quenches <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. But cupidity, whereby a man loves something besides <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, can increase in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> can decrease.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. viii, 12) "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> makes the just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, by justifying him, but in such a way, that if the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> turns away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he no longer retains the effect of the Divine operation." From this we may gather that when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> preserves <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, He works in the same way as when He first infuses <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> into him. Now at the first infusion of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> infuses less <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> into him that prepares himself less. Therefore also in preserving <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, He preserves less <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> in him that prepares himself less. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> can decrease.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> In <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is compared to fire, according to <a href="../bible/son008.htm#verse6">Canticles 8:6</a>: "The lamps thereof," i.e. of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, "are fire and flames." Now fire ever mounts upward so long as it lasts. Therefore as long as <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> endures, it can ascend, but cannot descend, i.e. decrease.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> which <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> has in comparison with its proper object, cannot decrease, even as neither can it increase, as stated above (4, ad 2).

<p>Since, however, it increases in that <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> which it has in comparison with its subject, here is the place to consider whether it can decrease in this way. Now, if it decrease, this must needs be either through an act, or by the mere cessation from act. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> acquired through acts decrease and sometimes cease altogether through cessation from act, as stated above (I-II, 53, 3). Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says, in reference to friendship (Ethic. viii, 5) "that want of intercourse," i.e. the neglect to call upon or speak with one's friends, "has destroyed many a friendship." Now this is because the safe-keeping of a thing depends on its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a>, so that when <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> cease, the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> acquired thereby decreases and at last ceases altogether. Yet this does not occur to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, because it is not the result of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, but is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Hence it follows that even when its act ceases, it does not for this reason decrease, or cease altogether, unless the cessation involves a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>The consequence is that a decrease of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> except either by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or by some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act. Now no defect is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in us by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, except by way of punishment, in so far as He withdraws His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Hence He does not diminish <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> except by way of punishment: and this punishment is due on account of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>It follows, therefore, that if <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> decrease, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of this decrease must be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> either effectively or by way of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. But mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not diminish <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, in either of these ways, but destroys it entirely, both effectively, because every mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as we shall state further on (12), and by way of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, since when, by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> mortally, a man acts against <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, he deserves that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should withdraw <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> from him.

<p>In like manner, neither can venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> diminish <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> either effectively or by way of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. Not effectively, because it does not touch <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, since <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is about the last end, whereas venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a disorder about things directed to the end: and a man's love for the end is none the less through his committing an inordinate act as regards the things directed to the end. Thus sick people sometimes, though they love health much, are <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregular</a> in keeping to their diet: and thus again, in speculative <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinions that are derived from the principles, do not diminish the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> of the principles. So too, venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> diminution of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; for when a man offends in a small <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> he does not deserve to be mulcted in a great <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not turn away from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, more than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> turns away from Him: wherefore he that is out of order in respect of things directed to the end, does not deserve to be mulcted in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> whereby he is ordered to the last end.

<p>The consequence is that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> can by no means be diminished, if we speak of direct <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>, yet whatever disposes to its corruption may be said to conduce indirectly to its diminution, and such are venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, or even the cessation from the practice of works of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Contraries affect the same subject when that subject stands in equal relation to both. But <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> does not stand in equal relation to increase and decrease. For it can have a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of increase, but not of decrease, as stated above. Hence the argument does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Cupidity is twofold, one whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> places his end in creatures, and this kills <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> altogether, since it is its poison, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (Confess. x). This makes us love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> less (i.e. less than we ought to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>), not indeed by diminishing <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> but by destroying it altogether. It is thus that we must understand the saying: "He loves Thee less, who loves aught beside Thee," for he adds these words, "which he loveth not for Thee." This does not apply to venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but only to mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: since that which we love in venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is loved for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a> though not actually. There is another cupidity, that of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is always diminished by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: and yet this cupidity cannot diminish <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, for the reason given above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A movement of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is requisite in the infusion of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as stated above (I-II, 113, 3). Wherefore that which diminishes the intensity of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> conduces dispositively to a diminution in the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> to be infused. On the other hand, no movement of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is required for the safe-keeping of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, else it would not remain inn us while we sleep. Hence <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> does not decrease on account of an obstacle on the part of the intensity of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will's</a> movement.

<h2 id="article11">Article 11. Whether we can lose charity when once we have it?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that we cannot lose <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> when once we have it. For if we lose it, this can only be through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now he who has <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for it is written (<a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse9">1 John 3:9</a>): "Whosoever is born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, committeth not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for His seed abideth in him, and he cannot <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because he is born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." But none save the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, for it is this which distinguishes "the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from the children of perdition," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xv, 17). Therefore he that has <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> cannot lose it.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. viii, 7) that "if love be not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, it should not be called love." Now, as he says again in a letter to Count Julian, "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> which can fail was never <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>." [The quotation is from De Salutaribus Documentis ad quemdam comitem, vii., among the works of Paul of Friuli, more commonly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as <a href="../cathen/11591b.htm">Paul the Deacon</a>, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Monte Cassino.] Therefore it was no <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> at all. Therefore, when once we have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, we cannot lose it.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says in a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> for Pentecost (In Evang. xxx) that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> love works great things where it is; if it ceases to work it is not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>." Now no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> loses <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> by doing great things. Therefore if <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> be there, it cannot be lost.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is not inclined to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> unless by some motive for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> excludes all motives for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, both self-love and cupidity, and all such things. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> cannot be lost.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/rev002.htm#verse4">Apocalypse 2:4</a>): "I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> dwells in us by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as shown above (2; Q 23,24). We can, accordingly, consider <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> in three ways: first on the part of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, Who moves the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in this respect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is incompatible with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, Who does unfailingly whatever He wills to do. Hence it is impossible for these two things to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> at the same time--that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> should will to move a certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and that this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, should lose <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of perseverance is reckoned among the blessings of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> whereby "whoever is delivered, is most certainly delivered," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in his book on the Predestination of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> (De Dono Persev. xiv).

<p>Secondly, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> may be considered as such, and thus it is incapable of anything that is against its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> at all, even as neither can heat cool, nor unrighteousness do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 24).

<p>Thirdly, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> can be considered on the part of its subject, which is changeable on account of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. Moreover <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> may be compared with this subject, both from the general point of view of form in comparison with <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and from the specific point of view of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> as compared with power. Now it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> for a form to be in its subject in such a way that it can be lost, when it does not entirely fill the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: this is evident in the forms of things generated and corrupted, because the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of such things receives one form in such a way, that it retains the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to another form, as though its <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> were not completely satisfied with the one form. Hence the one form may be lost by the other being received. On the other hand the form of a celestial body which entirely fills the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> of its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, so that the latter does not retain the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to another form, is in its subject inseparably. Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of the blessed, because it entirely fills the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> of the rational mind, since every actual movement of that mind is directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is possessed by its subject inseparably: whereas the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of the wayfarer does not so fill the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> of its subject, because the latter is not always actually directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: so that when it is not actually directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, something may occur whereby <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is lost.

<p>It is proper to a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> to incline a power to act, and this belongs to a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, in so far as it makes whatever is suitable to it, to seem <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and whatever is unsuitable, to seem <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For as the taste judges of savors according to its disposition, even so does the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind judge of things to be done, according to its <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> disposition. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 5) that "such as a man is, so does the end appear to him." Accordingly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is inseparable from its possessor, where that which pertains to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> cannot appear otherwise than <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and that is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, where <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is seen in His Essence, which is the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> cannot be lost, whereas the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of the way can, because in this state <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not seen in His Essence, which is the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The passage quoted speaks from the point of view of the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, by Whose safeguarding, those whom He wills to move are rendered immune from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as much as He wills.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> which can fail by reason of itself is no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; for this would be the case, were its love given only for a time, and afterwards were to cease, which would be inconsistent with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> love. If, however, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> be lost through the changeableness of the subject, and against the purpose of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> included in its act, this is not contrary to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> ever works great things in its purpose, which is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; but it does not always work great things in its act, on account of the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of its subject.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> by reason of its act excludes every motive for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>. But it happens sometimes that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not acting actually, and then it is possible for a motive to intervene for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, and if we consent to this motive, we lose <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<h2 id="article12">Article 12. Whether charity is lost through one mortal sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not lost through one mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> says (Peri Archon i): "When a man who has mounted to the stage of perfection, is satiated, I do not think that he will become empty or fall away suddenly; but he must needs do so gradually and by little and little." But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> falls away by losing <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not lost through only one mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, Pope Leo in a sermon on the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> (60) addresses <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> thus: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> saw in thee not a conquered <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, not an averted love, but constancy shaken. Tears abounded where love never failed, and the words uttered in trepidation were washed away by the fount of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>." From this <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">Bernard</a> [<a href="../cathen/15638a.htm">William of St. Thierry</a>, De Nat. et Dig. Amoris. vi.] drew his assertion that "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> in <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> was not quenched, but cooled."

<p>But <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> mortally in denying <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not lost through one mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is stronger than an acquired <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of acquired <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not destroyed by one contrary <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act. Much less, therefore, is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> destroyed by one contrary mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> denotes love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and our neighbor. Now, seemingly, one may commit a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and yet retain the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and one's neighbor; because an inordinate affection for things directed to the end, does not remove the love for the end, as stated above (<a href="#10">Article 10</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can endure, though there be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through an inordinate affection for some temporal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the object of a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is the last end. Now the other theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, namely <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope, are not done away by one mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in fact they remain though lifeless. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> can remain without a form, even when a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has been committed.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> By mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> becomes deserving of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> death, according to <a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse23">Romans 6:23</a>: "The wages of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is death." On the other hand whoever has <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is deserving of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, for it is written (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse21">John 14:21</a>): "He that loveth Me, shall be loved by My Father: and I will love Him, and will manifest Myself to him," in which manifestation everlasting life consists, according to <a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse3">John 17:3</a>: "This is <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>; that they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Thee the . . . <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> Whom Thou hast sent." Now no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can be worthy, at the same time, of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> and of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> death. Therefore it is impossible for a man to have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> with a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is destroyed by one mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> That one contrary is removed by the other contrary supervening. Now every mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> by its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which consists in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> above all things, and subjecting himself to Him entirely, by referring all that is his to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It is therefore <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should so love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as to wish to submit to Him in all things, and always to follow the rule of His commandments; since whatever is contrary to His commandments is manifestly contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and therefore by its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is capable of destroying <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p>If indeed <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> were an acquired <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> dependent on the power of its subject, it would not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> be removed by one mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for act is directly contrary, not to <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> but to act. Now the endurance of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> in its subject does not require the endurance of its act, so that when a contrary act supervenes the acquired <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is not at once done away. But <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, being an infused <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, depends on the action of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who infuses it, Who stands in relation to the infusion and safekeeping of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as the sun does to the diffusion of light in the air, as stated above (10, Objection 3). Consequently, just as the light would cease at once in the air, were an obstacle placed to its being lit up by the sun, even so <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> ceases at once to be in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> through the placing of an obstacle to the outpouring of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> into the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p>Now it is evident that through every mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is contrary to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> commandments, an obstacle is placed to the outpouring of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, since from the very fact that a man chooses to prefer <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> friendship, which requires that we should obey His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, it follows that the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is lost at once through one mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. viii, 12) that "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is enlightened by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> presence, but he is darkened at once by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> absence, because distance from Him is effected not by change of place but by aversion of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This saying of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> may be understood, in one way, that a man who is in the state of perfection, does not suddenly go so far as to commit a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but is disposed thereto by some previous negligence, for which reason venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are said to be dispositions to mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated above (I-II, 88, 3). Nevertheless he falls, and loses <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> through the one mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> if he commits it.

<p>Since, however, he adds: "If some slight slip should occur, and he recover himself quickly he does not appear to fall altogether," we may reply in another way, that when he speaks of a man being emptied and falling away altogether, he means one who falls so as to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>; and this does not occur in a perfect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> all at once.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> may be lost in two ways; first, directly, by actual contempt, and, in this way, <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> did not lose <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Secondly, indirectly, when a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is committed against <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, through some passion of desire or fear; it was by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> against <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> in this way, that <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> lost <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; yet he soon recovered it.

<p>The Reply to the Third Objection is evident from what has been said.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Not every inordinate affection for things directed to the end, i.e., for <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> goods, constitutes a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but only such as is directly contrary to the Divine will; and then the inordinate affection is contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as stated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> denotes union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whereas <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope do not. Now every mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> consists in aversion from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated above (Gen. ad lit. viii, 12). Consequently every moral <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, but not to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope, but only certain determinate <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which destroy the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or of hope, even as <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is destroyed by every moral <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Hence it is evident that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> cannot remain lifeless, since it is itself the ultimate form regarding <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> under the aspect of last end as stated above (Question 23, Article 8).
