<h1>Question 25. Indulgences</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5025.htm#article1"> Does an indulgence remit any part of the punishment due for the satisfaction of sins?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5025.htm#article2"> Are indulgences as effective as they claim to be?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5025.htm#article3"> Should an indulgence be granted for temporal assistance?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether an indulgence can remit any part of the punishment due for the satisfaction of sins?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> cannot remit any part of the punishment due for the satisfaction of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Because a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse13">2 Timothy 2:13</a>, "He cannot deny Himself," says: "He would do this if He did not keep His word." Now He said (<a href="../bible/deu025.htm#verse2">Deuteronomy 25:2</a>): "According to the measure of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> shall the measure also of the stripes be." Therefore nothing can be remitted from the satisfactory punishment which is appointed according to the measure of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, an inferior cannot <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> from an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> imposed by his superior. But when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> absolves us from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> He binds us to temporal punishment, as <a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugh of St. Victor</a> declares (Tract. vi Sum. Sent. [Of doubtful authenticity]). Therefore no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> from that punishment, by remitting any part of it.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the granting of the sacramental effect without the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> belongs to the power of excellence. Now none but <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has the power of excellence in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Since then satisfaction is a part of the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a>, conducing to the remission of the punishment due, it seems that no mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can remit the debt of punishment without satisfaction.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the power of the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was given them, not "unto destruction," but "unto edification" (<a href="../bible/2co010.htm#verse8">2 Corinthians 10:8</a>). But it would be conducive to destruction, if satisfaction, which was intended for our <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, inasmuch as it serves for a remedy, were done away with. Therefore the power of the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not extend to this.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse10">2 Corinthians 2:10</a>): "For, what I have pardoned, if I have pardoned anything, for your sakes have I done it in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>," and a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> adds: i.e. "as though <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself had pardoned." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> could remit the punishment of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> without any satisfaction, as evidenced in the case of the <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulterous</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> (<a href="../bible/joh008.htm">John 8</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> could do so likewise. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a> can too, since his power in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is not less than <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a>.

<p>Further, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">universal</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>; since He Who "was heard for His reverence" (<a href="../bible/heb005.htm#verse7">Hebrews 5:7</a>) said to Peter, on whose profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was founded (<a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse32">Luke 22:32</a>): "I have <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for thee that thy <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> fail not." Now the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">universal</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> approves and grants <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> have some value.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> All admit that <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> have some value, for it would be <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> to say that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does anything in vain. But some say that they do not avail to free a man from the debt of punishment which he has deserved in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> judgment, and that they merely serve to free him from the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> imposed on him by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> as a punishment for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, or from the canonical penalties he has incurred. But this opinion does not seem to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. First, because it is expressly opposed to the privilege granted to Peter, to whom it was said (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse19">Matthew 16:19</a>) that whatsoever he should loose on earth should be loosed also in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Wherefore whatever remission is granted in the court of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> holds good in the court of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Moreover the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by granting such <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> would do more harm than <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since, by remitting the punishment she had enjoined on a man, she would deliver him to be punished more severely in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>.

<p>Hence we must say on the contrary that <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> hold <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> both in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> court and in the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for the remission of the punishment which remains after <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>, and confession, whether this punishment be enjoined or not. The reason why they so avail is the oneness of the <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">mystical body</a> in which many have performed works of satisfaction exceeding the requirements of their debts; in which, too, many have patiently borne <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> tribulations whereby a multitude of punishments would have been paid, had they been incurred. So great is the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of such <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> that it exceeds the entire debt of punishment due to those who are living at this moment: and this is especially due to the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> of Christ: for though He acts through the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, yet His efficacy is nowise restricted to them, but <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> surpasses their efficacy.

<p>Now one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can satisfy for another, as we have explained above (Question 13, Article 2). And the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in whom this super-abundance of satisfactions is found, did not perform their <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works for this or that particular <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, who needs the remission of his punishment (else he would have received this remission without any <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> at all), but they performed them for the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in general, even as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> declares that he fills up "those things that are wanting of the sufferings of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> . . . for His body, which is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>" to whom he wrote (<a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse24">Colossians 1:24</a>). These <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, then, are the common property of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Now those things which are the common property of a number are distributed to the various <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> according to the judgment of him who rules them all. Hence, just as one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would obtain the remission of his punishment if another were to satisfy for him, so would he too if another's satisfactions be applied to him by one who has the power to do so.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The remission which is granted by means of <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> does not destroy the proportion between punishment and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, since someone has spontaneously taken upon himself the punishment due for another's guilt, as explained above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> He who gains an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> is not, strictly speaking, <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> from the debt of punishment, but is given the means whereby he may pay it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The effect of sacramental <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> is the removal of a man's guilt, an effect which is not produced by <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>. But he who grants <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> pays the debt of punishment which a man owes, out of the common stock of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> goods, as explained above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Grace</a> affords a better remedy for the avoidance of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than does habituation to (<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>) works. And since he who gains an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> is disposed to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> through the love which he conceives for the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for which the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> is granted, it follows that <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> provide a remedy against <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Consequently it is not harmful to grant <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> unless this be done without discretion. Nevertheless those who gain <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> should be advised, not, on this account, to omit the penitential works imposed on them, so that they may derive a remedy from these also, even though they may be quit of the debt of punishment; and all the more, seeing that they are often more in debt than they think.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether indulgences are as effective as they claim to be?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> are not as effective as they claim to be. For <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> have no effect save from the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a>. Now by the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a>, he who has that power can only remit some fixed part of the punishment due for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, after taking into account the measure of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and of the penitent's sorrow. Since then <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> depend on the mere will of the grantor, it seems that they are not as effective as they claim to be.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the debt of punishment keeps <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> back from the attainment of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, which he ought to desire above all things. Now, if <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> are as effective as they claim to be, a man by setting himself to gain <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> might become immune from all debt of temporal punishment. Therefore it would seem that a man ought to put aside all other kinds of works, and devote himself to gain <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, sometimes an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> whereby a man is remitted a third part of the punishment due for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is granted if he contribute towards the erection of a certain building. If, therefore, <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> produce the effect which is claimed for them, he who gives a penny, and then another, and then again another, would obtain a plenary <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> from all punishment due for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which seems absurd.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, sometimes an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> is granted, so that for visiting a church a man obtains a seven years' remission. If, then, an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> avails as much as is claimed for it a man who lives near that church, or the clergy attached thereto who go there every day, obtain as much <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> as one who comes from a distance (which would appear <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>); moreover, seemingly, they would gain the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> several times a day, since they go there repeatedly.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, to remit a man's punishment beyond a just estimate seems to amount to the same as to remit it without reason; because in so far as he exceeds that estimate, he limits the compensation. Now he who grants an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> cannot without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> remit a man's punishment either wholly or partly, even though the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a> were to say to anyone: "I remit to all the punishment you owe for your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." Therefore it seems that he cannot remit anything beyond the just estimate. Now <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> are often published which exceed that just estimate. Therefore they do not avail as much as is claimed for them.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/job013.htm#verse7">Job 13:7</a>): "Hath <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> any need of your lie, that you should speak deceitfully for Him?" Therefore the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in publishing <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, does not lie; and so they avail as much as is claimed for them.

<p>Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse14">1 Corinthians 15:14</a>): "If . . . our preaching is vain, your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is also vain." Therefore whoever utters a falsehood in preaching, so far as he is concerned, makes <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> void. and so <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally. If therefore <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> are not as effective as they claim to be, all who publish <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> would commit a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: which is absurd.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> on this point there are many opinions. For some maintain that <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> have not the efficacy claimed for them, but that they simply avail each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> in proportion to his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and devotion. And consequently those who maintain this, say that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> publishes her <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> in such a way as, by a kind of pious <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a>, to induce men to do well, just as a mother entices her child to walk by holding out an apple. But this seems a very dangerous assertion to make. For as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (Ep. ad Hieron. lxxviii), "if any <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> were discovered in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>, the authority of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> would perish." In like manner, if any <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> were to be found in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> preaching, her doctrine would have no authority in settling questions of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p>Hence others have maintained that <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> avail as much as is claimed for them, according to a just estimate, not of him who grants it--who perhaps puts too high a value on it--nor of the recipient--for he may prize too highly the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> he receives, but a just estimate according to the estimate of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> men who consider the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> affected, and the utility and needs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> needs are greater at one time than at another. Yet, neither, seemingly, can this opinion stand. First, because in that case <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> would no longer be a remission, but rather a mere commutation. Moreover the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> would not be excused from untruth, since, at times, <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> are granted far in excess of the requirements of this just estimate, taking into consideration all the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>, as, for example, when the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a> granted to anyone who visited a certain church, an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> of seven years, which <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> was granted by Blessed Gregory for the Roman Stations.

<p>Hence others say that the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of remission accorded in an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> is not to be measured by the devotion of the recipient, as the first opinion suggested, nor according to the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of what is given, as the second opinion held; but according to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for which the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> is granted, and according to which a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is held deserving of obtaining such an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>. Thus according as a man approached near to that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, so would he obtain remission in whole or in part. But neither will this explain the custom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who assigns, now a greater, now a lesser <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>, for the same <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: thus, under the same circumstances, now a year's <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>, now one of only forty days, according to the graciousness of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, who grants the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>, is granted to those who visit a church. Wherefore the amount of the remission granted by the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> is not to be measured by the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for which a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is worthy of an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>.

<p>We must therefore say otherwise that the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of an effect is proportionate to the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the remission of punishment effected by <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> is no other than the abundance of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, and this abundance suffices for the remission of all punishment. The effective <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the remission is not the devotion, or toil, or <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the recipient; nor, again, is it the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for which the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> was granted. We cannot, then, estimate the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the remission by any of the foregoing, but solely by the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>--and these are always superabundant. Consequently, according as these <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> are applied to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> so does he obtain remission. That they should be so applied demands, firstly, authority to dispense this treasure. secondly, union between the recipient and Him Who <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> it--and this is brought about by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; thirdly, there is required a reason for so dispensing this treasury, so that the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, namely, of those who wrought these <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> works is safeguarded, since they did them for the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in general. Hence whenever the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> assigned tends to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, there is sufficient reason for granting an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>.

<p>Hence, according to others, <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> have precisely the efficacy claimed for them, provided that he who grants them have the authority, that the recipient have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and that, as regards the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, there be piety which includes the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the profit of our neighbor. Nor in this view have we "too great a market of the Divine mercy" [St. Bonaventure, Sent. iv, D, 20, as some maintain, nor again does it derogate from Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, for no punishment is remitted, but the punishment of one is imputed to another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (Question 19, Article 3) there are two keys, the key of orders and the key of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. The key of orders is a sacramental: and as the effects of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are fixed, not by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> but by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> cannot decide in the tribunal of confession how much shall be remitted by means of the key of orders from the punishment due; it is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who appoints the amount to be remitted. On the other hand the key of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> is not something sacramental, and its effect depends on a man's decision. The remission granted through <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> is the effect of this key, since it does not belong to the dispensation of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, but to the distribution of the common property of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: hence it is that legates, even though they be not <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, can grant <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>. Consequently the decision of how much punishment is to be remitted by an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> depends on the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the one who grants that <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>. If, however, he remits punishment without sufficient reason, so that men are enticed to substitute mere nothings, as it were, for works of penance, he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by granting such <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, although the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> is gained fully.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> avail much for the remission of punishment, yet works of satisfaction are more <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> in respect of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward, which <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> transcends the remission of temporal punishment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> When an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> is granted in a general way to anyone that helps towards the building of a church, we must understand this to mean a help proportionate to the giver: and in so far as he approaches to this, he will gain the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> more or less fully. Consequently a poor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by giving one penny would gain the full <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>, not so a rich <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, whom it would not become to give so little to so <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and profitable a work; Just as a king would not be said to help a man if he gave him an "obol."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who lives near the church, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and clergy of the church, gain the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> as much as those who come perhaps a distance of a thousand days' journey: because the remission, as stated above, is proportionate, not to the toil, but to the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> which are applied. Yet he who toils most gains most <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. This, however, is to be understood of those cases in which an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> is given in an undeterminate manner. For sometimes a distinction is expressed: thus the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a> at the time of general <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> grants an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> of five years to those who come from across the seas, and one of three years to those who come from across the mountains, to others an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> of one year. Nor does a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> gain the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> each time he visits the church during the term of <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>, because sometimes it is granted for a fixed time; thus when it is said, "Whoever visits such and such a church until such and such a day, shall gain so much <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>," we must understand that it can be gained only once. on the other hand if there be a continual <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> in a certain church, as the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> of forty days to be gained in the church of the Blessed Peter, then a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> gains the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> as often as he visits the church.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> An <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> requires a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, not as a measure of the remission of punishment, but in order that the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of those whose <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> are applied, may reach to this particular <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. Now one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is applied to another in two ways: first, by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; and in this way, even without <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> shares in all the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> done, provided he have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: secondly, by the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who does the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> action; and in this way, provided there be a lawful <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who has done something for the profit of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, may reach to some <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> through <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether an indulgence ought to be granted for temporal help?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> ought not to be granted for temporal help. Because the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is something <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>. Now to exchange a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> for a temporal thing is <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>. Therefore this ought not to be done.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> assistance is more <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> than temporal. But <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> do not appear to be granted for <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> assistance. Much less therefore ought they to be granted for temporal help.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> stands the common custom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in granting <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> for pilgrimages and <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsgiving</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Temporal things are subordinate to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> matters, since we must make use of temporal things on account of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things. Consequently an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> must not be granted for the sake of temporal matters as such, but in so far as they are subordinate to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things: such as the quelling of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> enemies, who disturb her peace; or such as the building of a church, of a bridge, and other forms of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsgiving</a>. It is therefore evident that there is no simony in these transactions, since a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> thing is exchanged, not for a temporal but for a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> commodity.

<p>Hence the Reply to the First Objection is clear.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Indulgences can be, and sometimes are, granted even for purely <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> matters. Thus <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Pope Innocent IV</a> granted an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> of ten days to all who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for the king of France; and in like manner sometimes the same <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> is granted to those who preach a crusade as to those who take part in it.
