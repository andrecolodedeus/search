<h1>Question 25. The adoration of Christ</h1>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether Christ's humanity and Godhead are to be adored with the same adoration?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> humanity and Godhead are not to be <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> with the same adoration. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Godhead is to be <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a>, as being common to Father and Son; wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse23">John 5:23</a>): "That all may <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> the Son, as they <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> the Father." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> humanity is not common to Him and the Father. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> humanity and Godhead are not to be <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> with the same adoration.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is properly "the reward of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 3). But <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> its reward by action. Since, therefore, in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the action of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> is distinct from that of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as stated above (Question 19, Article 1), it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> humanity is to be <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> with a different adoration from that which is given to His Godhead.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> were not united to the Word, it would have been worthy of veneration on account of the excellence of its wisdom and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But by being united to the Word it lost nothing of its worthiness. Therefore His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> should receive a certain veneration proper thereto, besides the veneration which is given to His Godhead.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> We read in the chapters of the <a href="../cathen/04308b.htm">Fifth Council</a> [coll. viii, can. 9]: "If anyone say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> in two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, so as to introduce two distinct adorations, and does not <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Word made flesh with the one and the same adoration as His flesh, as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has handed down from the beginning; let such a one be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We may consider two things in a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to whom <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is given: the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> himself, and the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of his being <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>. Now properly speaking <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is given to a subsistent thing in its entirety: for we do not speak of honoring a man's hand, but the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> himself. And if at any time it happen that we speak of honoring a man's hand or foot, it is not by reason of these members being <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> of themselves: but by reason of the whole being <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> in them. In this way a man may be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> even in something external; for instance in his vesture, his image, or his messenger.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is that by reason of which the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> has a certain excellence. for <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is reverence given to something on account of its excellence, as stated in II-II, 103, 1. If therefore in one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> there are several <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, for instance, rank, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> given to him will be one in respect of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>, but several in respect of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>: for it is the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>, both on account of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and by reason of his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p>Since, therefore, in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there is but one Person of the Divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, and one hypostasis, and one suppositum, He is given one adoration and one <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> on the part of the Person <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a>: but on the part of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for which He is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>, we can say that there are several adorations, for instance that He receives one <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> on account of His uncreated <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and another on account of His <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p>But if it be said that there are several <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> or hypostases in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, it would follow that there would be, absolutely speaking, several adorations. And this is what is condemned in the Councils. For it is written in the chapters of Cyril [Council of Ephesus, Part I, ch. 26]: "If anyone dare to say that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> assumed should be <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> besides the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Divine Word</a>, as though these were distinct <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; and does not rather <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> the Emmanuel with one single adoration, inasmuch as the Word was made flesh; let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> there are three Who are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>, but only one <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> it is the reverse: and therefore only one <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is given to the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> and only one to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but in a different way.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Operation is not the object but the motive of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. And therefore there being two operations in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> proves, not two adorations, but two <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of adoration.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> were not united to the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, it would be the principal thing in that Man. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> would be due to it principally, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is that which is principal in him [Cf. Ethic. ix, 8]. But since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united to a Person of greater dignity, to that Person is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> principally due to Whom <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united. Nor is the dignity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> hereby diminished, but rather increased, as stated above (2, 2, ad 2).

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether Christ's humanity should be adored with the adoration of "latria"?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> should not be <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> with the adoration of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>." For on the words of <a href="../bible/psa098.htm#verse5">Psalm 98:5</a>, "Adore His foot-stool for it is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>," a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "The flesh assumed by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is rightly <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> by us: for no one partakes spiritually of His flesh unless he first <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> it; but not indeed with the adoration called '<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>,' which is due to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a> alone." Now the flesh is part of the humanity. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> humanity is not to be <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> with the adoration of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the worship of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>" is not to be given to any creature: since for this reason were the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> reproved, that they "worshiped and served the creature," as it is written (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse25">Romans 1:25</a>). But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> humanity is a creature. Therefore it should not be <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> with the adoration of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the adoration of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>" is due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in recognition of His supreme dominion, according to <a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse13">Deuteronomy 6:13</a>: "Thou shalt <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'fear'; cf. <a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse10">Matthew 4:10</a>] the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>, and shalt serve Him only." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is less than the Father. Therefore His humanity is not to be <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> with the adoration of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iv, 3): "On account of the incarnation of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Divine Word</a>, we <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> the flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> not for its own sake, but because the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is united thereto in <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>." And on <a href="../bible/psa098.htm#verse5">Psalm 98:5</a>, "Adore His foot-stool," a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "He who adores the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, regards not the earth, but rather Him whose foot-stool it is, in Whose <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> he adores the foot-stool." But the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a> Word is <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> with the adoration of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>." Therefore also His body or His humanity.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>) adoration is due to the subsisting hypostasis: yet the reason for honoring may be something non-subsistent, on account of which the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, in whom it is, is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>. And so the adoration of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> humanity may be understood in two ways. First, so that the humanity is the thing <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a>: and thus to <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> the flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is nothing else than to <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a> <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>: just as to <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> a King's robe is nothing else than to <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> a robed King. And in this sense the adoration of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> humanity is the adoration of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>." Secondly, the adoration of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> humanity may be taken as given by reason of its being perfected with every <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. And so in this sense the adoration of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> humanity is the adoration not of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>" but of "dulia." So that one and the same Person of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> with "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>" on account of His Divinity, and with "dulia" on account of His perfect humanity.

<p>Nor is this unfitting. For the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>" is due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father Himself on account of His Godhead; and the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of "dulia" on account of the dominion by which He rules over creatures. Wherefore on <a href="../bible/psa007.htm#verse1">Psalm 7:1</a>, "O Lord my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in Thee have I hoped," a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "Lord of all by power, to Whom 'dulia' is due: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all by creation, to Whom '<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>' is due."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> That <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> is not to be understood as though the flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> were <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> separately from its Godhead: for this could happen only, if there were one hypostasis of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and another of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But since, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iv, 3): "If by a subtle distinction you divide what is seen from what is understood, it cannot be <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> because it is a creature"--that is, with adoration of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>." And then thus understood as distinct from the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, it should be <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> with the adoration of "dulia"; not any kind of "dulia," such as is given to other creatures, but with a certain higher adoration, which is called "hyperdulia."

<p>Hence appear the answers to the second and third objections. Because the adoration of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>" is not given to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> humanity in respect of itself; but in respect of the Godhead to which it is united, by reason of which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not less than the Father.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the image of Christ should be adored with the adoration of "latria"?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> image should not be <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> with the adoration of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>." For it is written (<a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse4">Exodus 20:4</a>): "Thou shalt not make to thyself a graven thing, nor the likeness of anything." But no adoration should be given against the commandment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> image should not be <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> with the adoration of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, we should have nothing in common with the works of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse11">Ephesians 5:11</a>). But the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> are reproached principally for that "they changed the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the incorruptible <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> into the likeness of the image of a corruptible <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," as is written (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse23">Romans 1:23</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> image is not to be <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> with the adoration of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the adoration of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>" is due by reason of His Godhead, not of His humanity. But the adoration of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>" is not due to the image of His Godhead, which is imprinted on the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Much less, therefore, is it due to the material image which represents the humanity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it seems that nothing should be done in the Divine worship that is not instituted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse23">1 Corinthians 11:23</a>) when about to lay down the doctrine of the sacrifice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, says: "I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you." But <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> does not lay down anything concerning the adoration of images. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> image is not to be <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> with the adoration of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. iv, 16) quotes <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a> as saying: "The <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> given to an image reaches to the prototype," i.e. the exemplar. But the exemplar itself--namely, Christ--is to be <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> with the adoration of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>"; therefore also His image.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Memor. et Remin. i), there is a twofold movement of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> towards an image: one indeed towards the image itself as a certain thing; another, towards the image in so far as it is the image of something else. And between these movements there is this difference; that the former, by which one is moved towards an image as a certain thing, is different from the movement towards the thing: whereas the latter movement, which is towards the image as an image, is one and the same as that which is towards the thing. Thus therefore we must say that no reverence is shown to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> image, as a thing--for instance, carved or painted wood: because reverence is not due save to a rational creature. It follow therefore that reverence should be shown to it, in so far only as it is an image. Consequently the same reverence should be shown to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> image as to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself. Since, therefore, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> with the adoration of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>," it follows that His image should be <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> with the adoration of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This commandment does not forbid the making of any graven thing or likeness, but the making thereof for the purpose of adoration, wherefore it is added: "Thou shalt not <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> them nor serve them." And because, as stated above, the movement towards the image is the same as the movement towards the thing, adoration thereof is forbidden in the same way as adoration of the thing whose image it is. Wherefore in the passage quoted we are to understand the prohibition to <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> those images which the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> made for the purpose of venerating their own gods, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and so it is premised: "Thou shalt not have strange gods before Me." But no corporeal image could be raised to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, since He is incorporeal; because, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> observes (De Fide Orth. iv, 16): "It is the highest absurdity and impiety to fashion a figure of what is Divine." But because in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, He can be <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> in His corporeal image.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> forbids us to have anything in common with the "unfruitful works" of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, but not with their useful works. Now the adoration of images must be numbered among the unfruitful works in two respects. First, because some of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> used to <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> the images themselves, as things, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> that there was something Divine therein, on account of the answers which the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> used to give in them, and on account of other such like wonderful effects. Secondly on account of the things of which they were images; for they set up images to certain creatures, to whom in these images they gave the veneration of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>." Whereas we give the adoration of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>" to the image of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not for the sake of the image, but for the sake of the thing whose image it is, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Reverence is due to the rational creature for its own sake. Consequently, if the adoration of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>" were shown to the rational creature in which this image is, there might be an occasion of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>--namely, lest the movement of adoration might stop short at the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as a thing, and not be carried on to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Whose image he is. This cannot happen in the case of a graven or painted image in insensible material.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, led by the inward instinct of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, handed down to the churches certain instructions which they did not put in writing, but which have been ordained, in accordance with the observance of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as practiced by the faithful as time went on. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/2th002.htm#verse14">2 Thessalonians 2:14</a>): "Stand fast; and hold the traditions which you have learned, whether by word"--that is by word of mouth--"or by our epistle"--that is by word put into writing. Among these traditions is the worship of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> image. Wherefore it is said that Blessed Luke painted the image of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which is in Rome.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether Christ's cross should be worshipped with the adoration of "latria"?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> cross should not be worshiped with the adoration of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>." For no dutiful son honors that which dishonors his father, as the scourge with which he was scourged, or the gibbet on which he was hanged; rather does he abhor it. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> underwent the most shameful death on the cross; according to <a href="../bible/wis002.htm#verse20">Wisdom 2:20</a>: "Let us condemn Him to a most shameful death." Therefore we should not venerate the cross but rather we should abhor it.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> humanity is worshiped with the adoration of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>," inasmuch as it is united to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> in Person. But this cannot be said of the cross. Therefore Christ's cross should not be worshiped with the adoration of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as Christ's cross was the instrument of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">passion</a> and death, so were also many other things, for instance, the nails, the crown, the lance; yet to these we do not show the worship of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>." It seems, therefore, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> cross should not be worshiped with the adoration of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> We show the worship of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>" to that in which we place our hope of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. But we place our hope in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> cross, for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> sings: <blockquote> "Dear Cross, best hope o'er all beside,<br> That cheers the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> passion-tide:<br> Give to the just increase of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>,<br> Give to each <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a> sinner peace."<br> [Hymn Vexilla Regis: translation of Father Aylward, O.P.] </blockquote> Therefore Christ's cross should be worshiped with the adoration of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> or reverence is due to a rational creature only; while to an insensible creature, no <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> or reverence is due save by reason of a rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. And this in two ways. First, inasmuch as it represents a rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: secondly, inasmuch as it is united to it in any way whatsoever. In the first way men are wont to venerate the king's image; in the second way, his robe. And both are venerated by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> with the same veneration as they show to the king. If, therefore, we speak of the cross itself on which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was crucified, it is to be venerated by us in both ways--namely, in one way in so far as it represents to us the figure of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> extended thereon; in the other way, from its contact with the limbs of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and from its being saturated with His blood. Wherefore in each way it is worshiped with the same adoration as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, viz. the adoration of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>." And for this reason also we speak to the cross and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to it, as to the Crucified Himself. But if we speak of the effigy of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> cross in any other material whatever--for instance, in stone or wood, silver or gold--thus we venerate the cross merely as Christ's image, which we worship with the adoration of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>," as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> If in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> cross we consider the point of view and <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of those who did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, it will appear as His shame: but if we consider its effect, which is our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, it will appear as endowed with Divine power, by which it triumphed over the enemy, according to <a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse14">Colossians 2:14-15</a>: "He hath taken the same out of the way, fastening it to the cross, and despoiling the principalities and powers, He hath exposed them confidently, in open show, triumphing over them in Himself." Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse18">1 Corinthians 1:18</a>): "The Word of the cross to them indeed that perish is foolishness; but to them that are saved--that is, to us--it is the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although Christ's cross was not united to the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> in Person, yet it was united to Him in some other way, viz. by representation and contact. And for this sole reason reverence is shown to it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> By reason of the contact of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> limbs we worship not only the cross, but all that belongs to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iv, 11): "The precious wood, as having been sanctified by the contact of His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> body and blood, should be meetly worshiped; as also His nails, His lance, and His sacred dwelling-places, such as the manger, the cave and so forth." Yet these very things do not represent <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> image as the cross does, which is called "the Sign of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>" that "will appear in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>," as it is written (<a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse30">Matthew 24:30</a>). Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> said to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> (<a href="../bible/mar016.htm#verse6">Mark 16:6</a>): "You seek <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>, Who was crucified": he said not "pierced," but "crucified." For this reason we worship the image of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> cross in any material, but not the image of the nails or of any such thing.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the Mother of God should be worshipped with the adoration of "latria"?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> is to be worshiped with the adoration of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>." For it seems that the same <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is due to the king's mother as to the king: whence it is written (<a href="../bible/1ki002.htm#verse19">1 Kings 2:19</a>) that "a throne was set for the king's mother, and she sat on His right hand." Moreover, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [Sermon on the <a href="../cathen/02006b.htm">Assumption</a>, work of an anonymous author] says: "It is right that the throne of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the resting-place of the Lord of Heaven, the abode of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, should be there where He is Himself." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is worshiped with the adoration of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>." Therefore His Mother also should be.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iv, 16): "The <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of the Mother reflects on the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is worshiped with the adoration of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>." Therefore the Mother also.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, Christ's Mother is more akin to Him than the cross. But the cross is worshiped with the adoration of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>." Therefore also His Mother is to be worshiped with the same adoration.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> is a mere creature. Therefore the worship of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>" is not due to her.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>" is due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, it is not due to a creature so far as we venerate a creature for its own sake. For though insensible creatures are not capable of being venerated for their own sake, yet the rational creature is capable of being venerated for its own sake. Consequently the worship of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>" is not due to any mere rational creature for its own sake. Since, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> is a mere rational creature, the worship of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>" is not due to her, but only that of "dulia": but in a higher degree than to other creatures, inasmuch as she is the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>. For this reason we say that not any kind of "dulia" is due to her, but "hyperdulia."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> due to the king's mother is not equal to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> which is due to the king: but is somewhat like it, by reason of a certain excellence on her part. This is what is meant by the authorities quoted.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> given to the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Mother</a> reflects on her Son, because the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Mother</a> is to be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> for her<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Son's</a> sake. But not in the same way as <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> given to an image reflects on its exemplar: because the image itself, considered as a thing, is not to be venerated in any way at all.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The cross, considered in itself, is not an object of veneration, as stated above (4,5). But the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> is in herself an object of veneration. Hence there is no comparison.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether any kind of worship is due to the relics of the saints?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the relics of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are not to be worshiped at all. For we should avoid doing what may be the occasion of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. But to worship the relics of the dead seems to savor of the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, who gave <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to dead men. Therefore the relics of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are not to be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it seems absurd to venerate what is insensible. But the relics of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are insensible. Therefore it is absurd to venerate them.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a dead body is not of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> as a living body: consequently it does not seem to be identical with it. Therefore, after a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> death, it seems that his body should not be worshiped.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (De Eccles. Dogm. xl): "We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, above all the relics of the blessed <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, as being the members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, should be worshiped in all sincerity": and further on: "If anyone holds a contrary opinion, he is not accounted a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, but a follower of Eunomius and Vigilantius."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei i, 13): "If a father's coat or <a href="../cathen/13059a.htm">ring</a>, or anything else of that kind, is so much more cherished by his children, as love for one's parents is greater, in no way are the bodies themselves to be despised, which are much more intimately and closely united to us than any garment; for they belong to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." It is clear from this that he who has a certain affection for anyone, venerates whatever of his is left after his death, not only his body and the parts thereof, but even external things, such as his clothes, and such like. Now it is manifest that we should show <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as being members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the children and friends of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and our intercessors. Wherefore in memory of them we ought to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> any relics of theirs in a fitting manner: principally their bodies, which were temples, and organs of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> dwelling and operating in them, and are destined to be likened to the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself fittingly honors such relics by working <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> at their presence.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This was the argument of Vigilantius, whose words are quoted by <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> in the book he wrote against him (ch. ii) as follows: "We see something like a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> rite introduced under pretext of religion; they worship with kisses I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what tiny heap of dust in a mean vase surrounded with precious linen." To him <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> replies (Ep. ad Ripar. cix): "We do not <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a>, I will not say the relics of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, but either the sun or the moon or even the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>"--that is to say, with the worship of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>." "But we <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>' relics, so that thereby we give <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to Him Whose <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> [The original meaning of the word '<a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>,' i.e. the Greek <em>martys</em> is 'a witness'] they are: we <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> the servants, that the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> shown to them may reflect on their Master." Consequently, by honoring the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>' relics we do not fall into the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, who gave the worship of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>" to dead men.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> We worship that insensible body, not for its own sake, but for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which was once united thereto, and now enjoys <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake, whose ministers the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> were.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The dead body of a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> is not identical with that which the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> had during life, on account of the difference of form, viz. the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: but it is the same by identity of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, which is destined to be reunited to its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>.
