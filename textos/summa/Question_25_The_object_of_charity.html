<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the love of charity stops at God, or extends to our neighbor?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the love of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> stops at <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and does not extend to our neighbor. For as we owe <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> love, so do we owe Him fear, according <a href="../bible/deu010.htm#verse12">Deuteronomy 10:12</a>: "And now <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, what doth the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> require of thee, but that thou fear . . . and love Him?" Now the fear with which we fear <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and which is called <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> fear, is distinct from the fear with which we fear <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and which is either servile or filial, as is evident from what has been stated above (Question 10, Article 2). Therefore also the love with which we love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is distinct from the love with which we love our neighbor.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. viii, 8) that "to be loved is to be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>." Now the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as <a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">"latria"</a>, is distinct from the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> due to a creature, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as "dulia." Therefore again the love wherewith we love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is distinct from that with which we love our neighbor.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, hope begets <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> states on <a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse2">Matthew 1:2</a>. Now hope is so due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that it is reprehensible to hope in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, according to <a href="../bible/jer017.htm#verse5">Jeremiah 17:5</a>: "<a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">Cursed</a> be the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that trusteth in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is so due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as not to extend to our neighbor.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse21">1 John 4:21</a>): "This commandment we have from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that he, who loveth <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, love also his brother."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (17, 6; 19, 3; I-II, 54, 3) <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are not differentiated except their acts be of different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. For every act of the one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> belongs to the same <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. Now since the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of an act is derived from its object, considered under its formal aspect, it follows of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> that it is specifically the same act that tends to an aspect of the object, and that tends to the object under that aspect: thus it is specifically the same visual act whereby we see the light, and whereby we see the color under the aspect of light.

<p>Now the aspect under which our neighbor is to be loved, is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since what we ought to love in our neighbor is that he may be in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence it is clear that it is specifically the same act whereby we love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and whereby we love our neighbor. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> extends not only to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but also to the love of our neighbor.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> We may fear our neighbor, even as we may love him, in two ways: first, on account of something that is proper to him, as when a man <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> a tyrant on account of his cruelty, or loves him by reason of his own desire to get something from him. Such like <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> fear is distinct from the fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the same applies to love. Secondly, we fear a man, or love him on account of what he has of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; as when we fear the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a> by reason of its exercising the ministry of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the punishment of evildoers, and love it for its <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: such like fear of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not distinct from fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as neither is such like love.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Love regards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in general, whereas <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> regards the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, for it is given to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in recognition of his own <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Hence love is not differentiated specifically on account of the various degrees of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> in various <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, so long as it is referred to one <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> common to all, whereas <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is distinguished according to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> belonging to <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>. Consequently we love all our neighbors with the same love of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, in so far as they are referred to one <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> common to them all, which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; whereas we give various honors to various people, according to each one's own <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and likewise to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> we give the singular <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of latria on account of His singular <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is wrong to hope in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as though he were the principal author of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, but not, to hope in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as helping us ministerially under <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. On like manner it would be wrong if a man loved his neighbor as though he were his last end, but not, if he loved him for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake; and this is what <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> does.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether we should love charity out of charity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> need not be loved out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For the things to be loved out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> are contained in the two precepts of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> (<a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse37">Matthew 22:37-39</a>): and neither of them includes <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, since <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is neither <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> nor our neighbor. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> need not be loved out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is founded on the fellowship of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, as stated above (Question 23, Article 1). But <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> cannot participate in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> need not be loved out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is a kind of friendship, as stated above (Question 23, Article 1). But no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can have friendship for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> or for an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, since such things cannot return love for love, which is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to friendship, as stated in Ethic. viii. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> need not be loved out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. viii, 8): "He that loves his neighbor, must, in consequence, love love itself." But we love our neighbor out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore it follows that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> also is loved out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> is love. Now love, by reason of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the power whose act it is, is capable of reflecting on itself; for since the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the universal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, whatever has the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, can be the object of an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: and since to <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is itself a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can will himself to will. Even so the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, whose object is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, understands that it understands, because this again is something <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Love, however, even by reason of its own <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, is capable of reflecting on itself, because it is a spontaneous movement of the lover towards the beloved, wherefore from the moment a man loves, he loves himself to love.

<p>Yet <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not love simply, but has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of friendship, as stated above (Question 23, Article 1). Now by friendship a thing is loved in two ways: first, as the friend for whom we have friendship, and to whom we wish <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things: secondly, as the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which we wish to a friend. It is in the latter and not in the former way that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is loved out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, because <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which we desire for all those whom we love out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. The same applies to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, and to the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and our neighbor are those with whom we are friends, but love of them includes the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, since we love both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and our neighbor, in so far as we love ourselves and our neighbor to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and this is to love <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> is itself the fellowship of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life, whereby we arrive at <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>: hence it is loved as the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which we desire for all whom we love out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument considers friendship as referred to those with whom we are friends.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether irrational creatures also ought to be loved out of charity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that irrational creatures also ought to be loved out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For it is chiefly by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> that we are conformed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> loves irrational creatures out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, for He loves "all things that are" (<a href="../bible/wis011.htm#verse25">Wisdom 11:25</a>), and whatever He loves, He loves by Himself Who is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore we also should love irrational creatures out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is referred to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> principally, and extends to other things as referable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now just as the rational creature is referable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in as much as it bears the resemblance of image, so too, are the irrational creatures, in as much as they bear the resemblance of a trace [Cf. I, 45, 7]. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> extends also to irrational creatures.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as the object of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. so is the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> extends to irrational creatures, since we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that the fishes and birds were brought forth out of the waters, and animals that walk, and plants, out of the earth. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> extends also to irrational creatures.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The love of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> extends to none but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and our neighbor. But the word neighbor cannot be extended to irrational creatures, since they have no fellowship with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the rational life. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> does not extend to irrational creatures.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to what has been stated above (Question 13, Article 1) <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is a kind of friendship. Now the love of friendship is twofold: first, there is the love for the friend to whom our friendship is given, secondly, the love for those <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things which we desire for our friend. With regard to the first, no irrational creature can be loved out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; and for three reasons. Two of these reasons refer in a general way to friendship, which cannot have an irrational creature for its object: first because friendship is towards one to whom we wish <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, while, properly speaking, we cannot wish <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to an irrational creature, because it is not competent, properly speaking, to possess <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, this being proper to the rational creature which, through its <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, is the master of its disposal of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> it possesses. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Phys. ii, 6) that we do not speak of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> befalling such like things, except metaphorically. Secondly, because all friendship is based on some fellowship in life; since "nothing is so proper to friendship as to live together," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proves (Ethic. viii, 5). Now irrational creatures can have no fellowship in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life which is regulated by reason. Hence friendship with irrational creatures is impossible, except metaphorically speaking. The third reason is proper to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is based on the fellowship of everlasting <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, to which the irrational creature cannot attain. Therefore we cannot have the friendship of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> towards an irrational creature.

<p>Nevertheless we can love irrational creatures out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, if we regard them as the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things that we desire for others, in so far, to wit, as we wish for their preservation, to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> use; thus too does <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> love them out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p>Wherefore the Reply to the First Objection is evident.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The likeness by way of trace does not confer the capacity for everlasting life, whereas the likeness of image does: and so the comparison fails.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> can extend to all that is in any way <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, whereas the friendship of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> extends only to such things as have a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> capacity for everlasting life; wherefore the comparison fails.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether a man ought to love himself out of charity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a man is not bound to love himself out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says in a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> (In Evang. xvii) that there "can be no <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> between less than two." Therefore no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> towards himself.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, friendship, by its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, implies mutual love and equality (Ethic. viii, 2,7), which cannot be of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> towards himself.

<p>But <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is a kind of friendship, as stated above (Question 23, Article 1). Therefore a man cannot have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> towards himself.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, anything relating to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> cannot be blameworthy, since <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> "dealeth not perversely" (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse4">1 Corinthians 13:4</a>). Now a man deserves to be blamed for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> himself, since it is written (<a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse1">2 Timothy 3:1-2</a>): "In the last days shall come dangerous times, men shall be lovers of themselves." Therefore a man cannot love himself out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse18">Leviticus 19:18</a>): "Thou shalt love thy friend as thyself." Now we love our friends out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore we should love ourselves too out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is a kind of friendship, as stated above (Question 23, Article 1), we may consider <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> from two standpoints: first, under the general notion of friendship, and in this way we must hold that, properly speaking, a man is not a friend to himself, but something more than a friend, since friendship implies union, for <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that "love is a unitive force," whereas a man is one with himself which is more than being united to another. Hence, just as unity is the principle of union, so the love with which a man loves himself is the form and root of friendship. For if we have friendship with others it is because we do unto them as we do unto ourselves, hence we read in Ethic. ix, 4,8, that "the origin of friendly relations with others lies in our relations to ourselves." Thus too with regard to principles we have something greater than science, namely understanding.

<p>Secondly, we may speak of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> in respect of its specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, namely as denoting <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> friendship with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the first place, and, consequently, with the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, among which things is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> himself who has <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Hence, among these other things which he loves out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> because they pertain to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he loves also himself out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> speaks there of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> under the general notion of friendship: and the Second Objection is to be taken in the same sense.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Those who love themselves are to be blamed, in so far as they love themselves as regards their sensitive <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which they humor. This is not to love oneself <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> according to one's rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, so as to desire for oneself the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things which pertain to the perfection of reason: and in this way chiefly it is through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> that a man loves himself.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether a man ought to love his body out of charity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a man ought not to love his body out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For we do not love one with whom we are unwilling to associate.

<p>But those who have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> shun the society of the body, according to <a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse24">Romans 7:24</a>: "Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" and <a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse23">Philippians 1:23</a>: "Having a desire to be dissolved and to be with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." Therefore our bodies are not to be loved out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the friendship of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is based on fellowship in the enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But the body can have no share in that enjoyment. Therefore the body is not to be loved out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, since <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is a kind of friendship it is towards those who are capable of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> in return. But our body cannot love us out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore it should not be loved out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 23,26) that there are four things that we should love out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and among them he reckons our own body.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Our bodies can be considered in two ways: first, in respect of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, secondly, in respect of the corruption of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and its punishment.

<p>Now the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of our body was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>, not by an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> principle, as the Manicheans pretend, but by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence we can use it for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> service, according to <a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse13">Romans 6:13</a>: "Present . . . your members as instruments of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Consequently, out of the love of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> with which we love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we ought to love our bodies also, but we ought not to love the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> effects of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and the corruption of punishment; we ought rather, by the desire of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, to long for the removal of such things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> did not shrink from the society of his body, as regards the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the body, in fact in this respect he was loth to be deprived thereof, according to <a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse4">2 Corinthians 5:4</a>: "We would not be unclothed, but clothed over." He did, however, wish to escape from the taint of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, which remains in the body, and from the corruption of the body which weighs down the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, so as to hinder it from seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence he says expressly: "From the body of this death."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although our bodies are unable to enjoy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> Him, yet by the works which we do through the body, we are able to attain to the perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence from the enjoyment in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> there overflows a certain <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> into the body, viz., "the flush of health and incorruption," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (Ep. ad Dioscor. cxviii). Hence, since the body has, in a fashion, a share of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, it can be loved with the love of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Mutual love is found in the friendship which is for another, but not in that which a man has for himself, either in respect of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, or in respect of his body.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether we ought to love sinners out of charity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that we ought not to love sinners out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/psa118.htm#verse113">Psalm 118:113</a>): "I have <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>." But David had perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore sinners should be <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> rather than loved, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "love is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>" as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says in a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> for Pentecost (In Evang. xxx). But <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> men do no works of the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>: on the contrary, they do such as would appear to be works of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa100.htm#verse8">Psalm 100:8</a>: "In the morning I put to death all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> of the land": and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> commanded (<a href="../bible/exo022.htm#verse18">Exodus 22:18</a>): "Wizards thou shalt not suffer to live." Therefore sinners should not be loved out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is part of friendship that one should desire and wish <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things for one's friends. Now the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, desire <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa009.htm#verse18">Psalm 9:18</a>: "May the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> be turned into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a> and <a href="../cathen/02141a.htm">A.V.</a>: 'The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> shall be,' etc. See Reply to this Objection.]." Therefore sinners should not be loved out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it is proper to friends to rejoice in, and will the same things. Now <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> does not make us will what sinners will, nor to rejoice in what gives them <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, but rather the contrary. Therefore sinners should not be loved out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, it is proper to friends to associate together, according to Ethic. viii. But we ought not to associate with sinners, according to <a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse17">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>: "Go ye out from among them." Therefore we should not love sinners out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 30) that "when it is said: 'Thou shalt love thy neighbor,' it is evident that we ought to look upon every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as our neighbor." Now sinners do not cease to be men, for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not destroy <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore we ought to love sinners out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Two things may be considered in the sinner: his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and his guilt. According to his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which he has from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he has a capacity for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, on the fellowship of which <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is based, as stated above (3; 23, 1,5), wherefore we ought to love sinners, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, in respect of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p>On the other hand their guilt is opposed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and is an obstacle to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Wherefore, in respect of their guilt whereby they are opposed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, all sinners are to be <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>, even one's father or mother or kindred, according to <a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse26">Luke 12:26</a>. For it is our <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>, in the sinner, his being a sinner, and to love in him, his being a man capable of bliss; and this is to love him <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, as such, and the object of his <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> was their <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, which was their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Such <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is perfect, of which he himself says (<a href="../bible/psa138.htm#verse22">Psalm 138:22</a>): "I have <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> them with a perfect <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is equivalent to love of his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Hence also this perfect <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> observes (Ethic. ix, 3), when our friends fall into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we ought not to deny them the amenities of friendship, so long as there is hope of their mending their ways, and we ought to help them more readily to regain <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than to recover money, had they lost it, for as much as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is more akin than money to friendship. When, however, they fall into very great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and become incurable, we ought no longer to show them friendliness. It is for this reason that both Divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laws command such like sinners to be put to death, because there is greater likelihood of their harming others than of their mending their ways. Nevertheless the judge puts this into effect, not out of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> for the sinners, but out of the love of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, by reason of which he prefers the public <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the life of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. Moreover the death inflicted by the judge profits the sinner, if he be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>, unto the expiation of his crime; and, if he be not <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>, it profits so as to put an end to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because the sinner is thus deprived of the power to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> any more.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Such like imprecations which we come across in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>, may be understood in three ways: first, by way of prediction, not by way of wish, so that the sense is: "May the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> be," that is, "The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> shall be, turned into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>." Secondly, by way of wish, yet so that the desire of the wisher is not referred to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> punishment, but to the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of the punisher, according to <a href="../bible/psa057.htm#verse11">Psalm 57:11</a>: "The just shall rejoice when he shall see the revenge," since, according to <a href="../bible/wis001.htm#verse13">Wisdom 1:13</a>, not even <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "hath pleasure in the destruction of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'living']" when He punishes them, but He rejoices in His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa010.htm#verse8">Psalm 10:8</a>: "The Lord is just and hath loved <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>." Thirdly, so that this desire is referred to the removal of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and not to the punishment itself, to the effect, namely, that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be destroyed, but that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may live.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> We love sinners out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, not so as to will what they will, or to rejoice in what gives them <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, but so as to make them will what we will, and rejoice in what rejoices us. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/jer015.htm#verse19">Jeremiah 15:19</a>): "They shall be turned to thee, and thou shalt not to be turned to them."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The weak should avoid associating with sinners, on account of the danger in which they stand of being perverted by them. But it is commendable for the perfect, of whose perversion there is no fear, to associate with sinners that they may convert them. For thus did <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> eat and drink with sinners as related by <a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse11">Matthew 9:11-13</a>. Yet all should avoid the society of sinners, as regards fellowship in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; in this sense it is written (<a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse17">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>): "Go out from among them . . . and touch not the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> thing," i.e. by consenting to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether sinners love themselves?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that sinners love themselves. For that which is the principle of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is most of all in the sinner. Now love of self is the principle of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, since <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 28) that it "builds up the city of Babylon." Therefore sinners most of all love themselves.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not destroy <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now it is in keeping with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should love himself: wherefore even irrational creatures <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> desire their own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, for instance, the preservation of their being, and so forth. Therefore sinners love themselves.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is beloved by all, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> states (Div. Nom. iv). Now many sinners reckon themselves to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore many sinners love themselves.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa010.htm#verse6">Psalm 10:6</a>): "He that loveth <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, hateth his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Love of self is common to all, in one way; in another way it is proper to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; in a third way, it is proper to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. For it is common to all for each one to love what he thinks himself to be. Now a man is said to be a thing, in two ways: first, in respect of his <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and, this way all think themselves to be what they are, that is, composed of a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body. On this way too, all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, both <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, love themselves, in so far as they love their own preservation.

<p>Secondly, a man is said to be something in respect of some predominance, as the sovereign of a state is spoken of as being the state, and so, what the sovereign does, the state is said to do. On this way, all do not think themselves to be what they are. For the reasoning mind is the predominant part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, while the sensitive and corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> takes the second place, the former of which the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> calls the "inward <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," and the latter, the "outward <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" (<a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse16">2 Corinthians 4:16</a>). Now the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> look upon their rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or the inward <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as being the chief thing in them, wherefore in this way they think themselves to be what they are. On the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> reckon their sensitive and corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, or the outward <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, to hold the first place. Wherefore, since they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not themselves aright, they do not love themselves aright, but love what they think themselves to be. But the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> themselves <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, and therefore <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> love themselves.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proves this from five things that are proper to friendship. For in the first place, every friend wishes his friend to be and to live; secondly, he desires <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things for him; thirdly, he does <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to him; fourthly, he takes pleasure in his company; fifthly, he is of one mind with him, rejoicing and sorrowing in almost the same things. On this way the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> love themselves, as to the inward <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, because they wish the preservation thereof in its integrity, they desire <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things for him, namely <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods, indeed they do their best to obtain them, and they take pleasure in entering into their own hearts, because they find there <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thoughts in the present, the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> of past <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and the hope of future <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, all of which are sources of pleasure. Likewise they experience no clashing of wills, since their whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> tends to one thing.

<p>On the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> have no wish to be preserved in the integrity of the inward <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, nor do they desire <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods for him, nor do they work for that end, nor do they take pleasure in their own company by entering into their own hearts, because whatever they find there, present, past and future, is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and horrible; nor do they agree with themselves, on account of the gnawings of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa049.htm#verse21">Psalm 49:21</a>: "I will reprove thee and set before thy face."

<p>In the same manner it may be shown that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> love themselves, as regards the corruption of the outward <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, whereas the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> do not love themselves thus.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The love of self which is the principle of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is that which is proper to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, and reaches "to the contempt of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," as stated in the passage quoted, because the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> so desire external goods as to despise <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love is not altogether forfeited by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, yet it is perverted in them, as explained above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> have some share of self-love, in so far as they think themselves <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Yet such love of self is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> but apparent: and even this is not possible in those who are very <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether charity requires that we should love our enemies?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> does not require us to love our enemies. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion lxxiii) that "this great <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," namely, the love of our enemies, is "not so universal in its application, as the object of our petition when we say: Forgive us our trespasses." Now no one is forgiven <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> without he have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, because, according to <a href="../bible/pro010.htm#verse12">Proverbs 10:12</a>, "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> covereth all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> does not require that we should love our enemies.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> does not do away with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now everything, even an irrational being, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> its contrary, as a lamb <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> a wolf, and water fire. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> does not make us love our enemies.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> "doth nothing perversely" (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse4">1 Corinthians 13:4</a>). Now it seems perverse to love one's enemies, as it would be to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> one's friends: hence Joab upbraided David by saying (<a href="../bible/2sa019.htm#verse6">2 Samuel 19:6</a>): "Thou lovest them that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> thee, and thou hatest them that love thee." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> does not make us love our enemies.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse44">Matthew 4:44</a>): "Love your enemies."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Love of one's enemies may be understood in three ways. First, as though we were to love our enemies as such: this is perverse, and contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, since it implies love of that which is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in another.

<p>Secondly love of one's enemies may mean that we love them as to their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but in general: and in this sense <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> requires that we should love our enemies, namely, that in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and our neighbor, we should not exclude our enemies from the love given to our neighbor in general.

<p>Thirdly, love of one's enemies may be considered as specially directed to them, namely, that we should have a special movement of love towards our enemies. <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> does not require this absolutely, because it does not require that we should have a special movement of love to every <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, since this would be impossible. Nevertheless <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> does require this, in respect of our being prepared in mind, namely, that we should be ready to love our enemies individually, if the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> were to occur. That <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should actually do so, and love his enemy for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake, without it being <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for him to do so, belongs to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> loves his neighbor, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake, the more he loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the more does he put enmities aside and show love towards his neighbor: thus if we loved a certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> very much, we would love his children though they were unfriendly towards us. This is the sense in which <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> speaks in the passage quoted in the First Objection, the Reply to which is therefore evident.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Everything <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> its contrary as such. Now our enemies are contrary to us, as enemies, wherefore this itself should be hateful to us, for their enmity should displease us. They are not, however, contrary to us, as men and capable of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>: and it is as such that we are bound to love them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is wrong to love one's enemies as such: <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> does not do this, as stated above.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether it is necessary for salvation that we should show our enemies the signs and effects of love?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> demands of a man to show his enemy the signs or effects of love. For it is written (<a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse18">1 John 3:18</a>): "Let us not love in word nor in tongue, but in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." Now a man loves in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> by showing the one he loves signs and effects of love. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> requires that a man show his enemies such signs and effects of love.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said in the same breath (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse44">Matthew 5:44</a>): "Love your enemies," and, "Do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to them that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> you." Now <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> demands that we love our enemies. Therefore it demands also that we should "do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to them."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, not only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> but also our neighbor is the object of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says in a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> for Pentecost (In Evang. xxx), that "love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be idle for wherever it is it does great things, and if it ceases to work, it is no longer love." Hence <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> towards our neighbor cannot be without producing works. But <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> requires us to love our neighbor without exception, though he be an enemy. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> requires us to show the signs and effects of love towards our enemies.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse44">Matthew 5:44</a>, "Do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to them that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> you," says: "To do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to one's enemies is the height of perfection" [<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, Enchiridion lxxiii]. Now <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> does not require us to do that which belongs to its perfection. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> does not require us to show the signs and effects of love to our enemies.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The effects and signs of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> are the result of inward love, and are in proportion with it. Now it is absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, for the fulfilment of the precept, that we should inwardly love our enemies in general, but not individually, except as regards the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> being prepared to do so, as explained above (<a href="#8">Article 8</a>).

<p>We must accordingly apply this to the showing of the effects and signs of love. For some of the signs and favors of love are shown to our neighbors in general, as when we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, or for a whole people, or when anyone bestows a favor on a whole community: and the fulfilment of the precept requires that we should show such like favors or signs of love towards our enemies. For if we did not so, it would be a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of vengeful spite, and contrary to what is written (<a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse18">Leviticus 19:18</a>): "Seek not revenge, nor be mindful of the injury of thy citizens."

<p>But there are other favors or signs of love, which one shows to certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in particular: and it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> that we show our enemies such like favors and signs of love, except as regards being ready in our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a>, for instance to come to their assistance in a case of urgency, according to <a href="../bible/pro025.htm#verse21">Proverbs 25:21</a>: "If thy enemy be hungry, give him to eat; if he thirst, give him . . . drink." Outside cases of urgency, to show such like favors to an enemy belongs to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, whereby we not only beware, as in <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> bound, of being overcome by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but also wish to overcome <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> [<a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse21">Romans 12:21</a>, which belongs to perfection: for then we not only beware of being drawn into <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> on account of the hurt done to us, but purpose to induce our enemy to love us on account of our kindliness.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether we ought to love the angels out of charity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that we are not bound to love the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. i), <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is a twofold love: the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of our neighbor. Now love of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> is not contained in the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since they are <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>; nor is it, seemingly, contained in the love of our neighbor, since they do not belong with us to a common <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Therefore we are not bound to love them out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, dumb animals have more in common with us than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have, since they belong to the same proximate genus as we do. But we have not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> towards dumb animals, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). Neither, therefore, have we towards the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, nothing is so proper to friends as companionship with one another (Ethic. viii, 5). But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are not our companions; we cannot even see them. Therefore we are unable to give them the friendship of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 30): "If the name of neighbor is given either to those whom we pity, or to those who pity us, it is evident that the precept binding us to love our neighbor includes also the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> from whom we receive many merciful favors."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 23, Article 1), the friendship of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is founded upon the fellowship of everlasting <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, in which men share in common with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse30">Matthew 22:30</a>) that "in the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> . . . men shall be as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>." It is therefore evident that the friendship of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> extends also to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Our neighbor is not only one who is united to us in a common <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but also one who is united to us by sharing in the blessings pertaining to everlasting life, and it is on the latter fellowship that the friendship of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is founded.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Dumb animals are united to us in the proximate genus, by reason of their sensitive <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; whereas we are partakers of everlasting <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, by reason not of our sensitive <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> but of our rational mind wherein we associate with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The companionship of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> does not consist in outward fellowship, which we have in respect of our sensitive <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; it consists in a fellowship of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, imperfect indeed in this life, but perfect in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, as stated above (23, 1, ad 1).

<h2 id="article11">Article 11. Whether we are bound to love the demons out of charity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that we ought to love the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are our neighbors by reason of their fellowship with us in a rational mind. But the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> also share in our fellowship thus, since <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, such as life and understanding, remain in them unimpaired, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> states (Div. Nom. iv). Therefore we ought to love the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> differ from the blessed <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, even as sinners from just men. Now the just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> loves the sinner out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore he ought to love the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> also out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, we ought, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, to love, as being our neighbors, those from whom we receive favors, as appears from the passage of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> quoted above (<a href="#9">Article 9</a>). Now the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are useful to us in many things, for "by <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempting</a> us they work crowns for us," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xi, 17). Therefore we ought to love the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/isa028.htm#verse18">Isaiah 28:18</a>): "Your league with death shall be abolished, and your covenant with <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> shall not stand." Now the perfection of a peace and covenant is through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore we ought not to have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> for the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> who live in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> and compass death.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#6">Article 6</a>), in the sinner, we are bound, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, to love his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But the name of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> is given to designate a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> deformed by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, wherefore <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> should not be loved out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Without however laying stress on the word, the question as to whether the spirits called <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> ought to be loved out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, must be answered in accordance with the statement made above (A2,3), that a thing may be loved out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> in two ways. First, a thing may be loved as the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who is the object of friendship, and thus we cannot have the friendship of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> towards the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. For it is an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> part of friendship that one should be a well-wisher towards one's friend; and it is impossible for us, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, to desire the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of everlasting life, to which <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is referred, for those spirits whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has condemned <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>, since this would be in opposition to our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> whereby we approve of His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p>Secondly, we love a thing as being that which we desire to be enduring as another's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. On this way we love irrational creatures out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, in as much as we wish them to endure, to give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and be useful to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>): and in this way too we can love the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> even out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, in as much as we desire those spirits to endure, as to their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The possession of everlasting <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is not impossible for the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> mind as it is for the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>; consequently the friendship of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> which is based on the fellowship of everlasting life, rather than on the fellowship of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, is possible towards the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but not towards the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In this life, men who are in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> retain the possibility of obtaining everlasting <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>: not so those who are lost in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, who, in this respect, are in the same case as the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> That the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are useful to us is due not to their <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> but to the ordering of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a>; hence this leads us to be friends, not with them, but with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who turns their perverse <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> to our profit.

<h2 id="article12">Article 12. Whether four things are rightly reckoned as to be loved out of charity, viz. God, our neighbor, our body and ourselves?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that these four things are not rightly reckoned as to be loved out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, to wit: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, our neighbor, our body, and ourselves. For, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (Tract. super Joan. lxxxiii), "he that loveth not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, loveth not himself." Hence love of oneself is included in the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore love of oneself is not distinct from the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a part ought not to be condivided with the whole. But our body is part of ourselves. Therefore it ought not to be condivided with ourselves as a distinct object of love.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as a man has a body, so has his neighbor. Since then the love with which a man loves his neighbor, is distinct from the love with which a man loves himself, so the love with which a man loves his neighbor's body, ought to be distinct from the love with which he loves his own body. Therefore these four things are not rightly distinguished as objects to be loved out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 23): "There are four things to be loved; one which is above us," namely <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, "another, which is ourselves, a third which is nigh to us," namely our neighbor, "and a fourth which is beneath us," namely our own body.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (23, 1,5), the friendship of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is based on the fellowship of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Now, in this fellowship, one thing is considered as the principle from which <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> flows, namely <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; a second is that which directly partakes of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, namely men and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; a third is a thing to which <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> comes by a kind of overflow, namely the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body.

<p>Now the source from which <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> flows is lovable by reason of its being the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>: that which is a partaker of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, can be an object of love for two reasons, either through being identified with ourselves, or through being associated with us in partaking of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, and in this respect, there are two things to be loved out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, in as much as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> loves both himself and his neighbor.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The different relations between a lover and the various things loved make a different kind of lovableness. Accordingly, since the relation between the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> lover and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is different from his relation to himself, these two are reckoned as distinct objects of love, for the love of the one is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the love of the other, so that the former love being removed the latter is taken away.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The subject of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is the rational mind that can be capable of obtaining <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, to which the body does not reach directly, but only by a kind of overflow. Hence, by his reasonable mind which holds the first place in him, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, loves himself in one way, and his own body in another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Man loves his neighbor, both as to his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and as to his body, by reason of a certain fellowship in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Wherefore, on the part of his neighbor, there is only one reason for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> him; and our neighbor's body is not reckoned as a special object of love.
