<h1>Question 25. The order of the passions to one another</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2025.htm#article1"> The relation of the irascible passions to the concupiscible passions</a> <li><a href="../summa/2025.htm#article2"> The relation of the concupiscible passions to one another</a> <li><a href="../summa/2025.htm#article3"> The relation of the irascible passions to one another</a> <li><a href="../summa/2025.htm#article4"> The four principal passions</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the irascible passions precede the concupiscible passions, or vice versa?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the irascible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> precede the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. For the order of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> is that of their objects. But the object of the irascible faculty is the difficult <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which seems to be the highest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore the irascible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> seem to precede the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the mover precedes that which is moved. But the irascible faculty is compared to the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>, as mover to that which is moved: since it is given to animals, for the purposed of removing the obstacles that hinder the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty from enjoying its object, as stated above (23, 1, ad 1; I, 81, 2). Now "that which removes an obstacle, is a kind of mover" (Phys. viii, 4). Therefore the irascible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> precede the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and sadness are <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. But <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and sadness succeed to the irascible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 5) that"retaliation <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> to cease, because it produces pleasure instead of the previous pain." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> follow the irascible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> regard the absolute <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, while the irascible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> regard a restricted, viz. the difficult, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Since, therefore, the absolute <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> precedes the restricted <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it seems that the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> precede the irascible.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> there is more diversity than in the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the irascible faculty. For in the former we find something relating to movement--e.g. desire; and something belonging to repose, e.g. <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and sadness. But in the irascible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> there is nothing pertaining to repose, and only that which belongs to movement. The reason of this is that when we find rest in a thing, we no longer look upon it as something difficult or arduous; whereas such is the object of the irascible faculty.

<p>Now since rest is the end of movement, it is first in the order of <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, but last in the order of execution. If, therefore, we compare the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the irascible faculty with those <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> that denote rest in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it is evident that in the order of execution, the irascible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> take precedence of such like <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty: thus hope precedes <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and hence <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> it, according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse12">Romans 12:12</a>): "Rejoicing in hope." But the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> passion which denotes rest in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, viz. sadness, comes between two irascible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>: because it follows fear; since we become sad when we are confronted by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that we feared: while it precedes the movement of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; since the movement of self-vindication, that results from sadness, is the movement of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. And because it is looked upon as a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thing to pay back the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> done to us; when the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has achieved this he rejoices. Thus it is evident that every <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the irascible faculty terminates in a <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> passion denoting rest, viz. either in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> or in sadness.

<p>But if we compare the irascible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> to those <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> that denote movement, then it is clear that the latter take precedence: because the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the irascible faculty add something to those of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty; just as the object of the irascible adds the aspect of arduousness or difficulty to the object of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty. Thus hope adds to desire a certain effort, and a certain raising of the spirits to the realization of the arduous <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. In like manner fear adds to aversion or detestation a certain lowness of spirits, on account of difficulty in shunning the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p>Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the irascible faculty stand between those <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> that denote movement towards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and those <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> that denote rest in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And it is therefore evident that the irascible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> both arise from and terminate in the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument would <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>, if the formal object of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty were something contrary to the arduous, just as the formal object of the irascible faculty is that which is arduous. But because the object of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> absolutely, it <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> precedes the object of the irascible, as the common precedes the proper.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The remover of an obstacle is not a direct but an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> mover: and here we are speaking of <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> as directly related to one another. Moreover, the irascible passion removes the obstacle that hinders the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> from resting in its object. Wherefore it only follows that the irascible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> precede those <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> that connote rest. The third object leads to the same conclusion.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether love is the first of the concupiscible passions?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that love is not the first of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty is so called from <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, which is the same passion as desire. But "things are named from their chief characteristic" (De Anima ii, 4). Therefore desire takes precedence of love.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, love implies a certain union; since it is a "uniting and binding force," as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv). But <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> or desire is a movement towards union with the thing <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> or desired. Therefore desire precedes love.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> precedes its effect. But pleasure is sometimes the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of love: since some love on account of pleasure (Ethic. viii, 3,4). Therefore pleasure precedes love; and consequently love is not the first of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 7,9) that all the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by love: since "love yearning for the beloved object, is desire; and, having and enjoying it, is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>." Therefore love is the first of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> are the object of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty. Now <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> precedes <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; since <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is privation of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Wherefore all the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, the object of which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> before those, the object of which is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>--that is to say, each precedes its contrary passion: because the quest of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is the reason for shunning the opposite <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p>Now <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> has the aspect of an end, and the end is indeed first in the order of <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, but last in the order of execution. Consequently the order of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> can be considered either in the order of <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> or in the order of execution. In the order of execution, the first place belongs to that which takes place first in the thing that tends to the end. Now it is evident that whatever tends to an end, has, in the first place, an aptitude or proportion to that end, for nothing tends to a disproportionate end; secondly, it is moved to that end; thirdly, it rests in the end, after having attained it. And this very aptitude or proportion of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is love, which is complacency in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; while movement towards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is desire or <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>; and rest in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> or pleasure. Accordingly in this order, love precedes desire, and desire precedes pleasure. But in the order of <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, it is the reverse: because the pleasure intended <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> desire and love. For pleasure is the enjoyment of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which enjoyment is, in a way, the end, just as the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> itself is, as stated above (11, 3, ad 3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> We name a thing as we understand it, for "words are signs of thoughts," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Peri Herm. i, 1). Now in most cases we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> by its effect. But the effect of love, when the beloved object is possessed, is pleasure: when it is not possessed, it is desire or <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>: and, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. x, 12), "we are more sensible to love, when we lack that which we love." Consequently of all the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is felt most; and for this reason the power is named after it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The union of lover and beloved is twofold. There is real union, consisting in the conjunction of one with the other. This union belongs to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> or pleasure, which follows desire. There is also an affective union, consisting in an aptitude or proportion, in so far as one thing, from the very fact of its having an aptitude for and an inclination to another, partakes of it: and love betokens such a union. This union precedes the movement of desire.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Pleasure <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> love, in so far as it precedes love in the order of <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether hope is the first of the irascible passions?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that hope is not the first of the irascible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Because the irascible faculty is denominated from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. Since, therefore, "things are names from their chief characteristic" (cf. 02, Objection 1), it seems that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> precedes and surpasses hope.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the object of the irascible faculty is something arduous. Now it seems more arduous to strive to overcome a contrary <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that threatens soon to overtake us, which pertains to daring; or an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> actually present, which pertains to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; than to strive simply to obtain some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Again, it seems more arduous to strive to overcome a present <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, than a future <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> seems to be a stronger passion than daring, and daring, than hope. And consequently it seems that hope does not precede them.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, when a thing is moved towards an end, the movement of withdrawal precedes the movement of approach. But fear and <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> imply withdrawal from something; while daring and hope imply approach towards something. Therefore fear and <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> precede hope and daring.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The nearer a thing is to the first, the more it precedes others. But hope is nearer to love, which is the first of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Therefore hope is the first of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> in the irascible faculty.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>) all irascible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> imply movement towards something. Now this movement of the irascible faculty towards something may be due to two <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>: one is the mere aptitude or proportion to the end; and this pertains to love or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, those whose object is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; and this belongs to sadness or <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. As a matter of fact, the presence of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> produces no passion in the irascible, as stated above (23, 3,4); but the presence of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> gives rise to the passion of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p>Since then in order of generation or execution, proportion or aptitude to the end precedes the achievement of the end; it follows that, of all the irascible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is the last in the order of generation. And among the other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the irascible faculty, which imply a movement arising from love of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, those whose object is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, viz. hope and <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, must <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> precede those whose object is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, viz. daring and fear: yet so that hope precedes <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>; since hope is a movement towards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as such, which is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> attractive, so that hope tends to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> directly; whereas <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> is a movement away from <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, a movement which is consistent with <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, not as such, but in respect of something else, wherefore its tendency from <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>, as it were. In like manner fear, through being a movement from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, precedes daring. And that hope and <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> precede fear and daring is evident from this--that as the desire of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is the reason for avoiding <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, so hope and <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> are the reason for fear and daring: because daring arises from the hope of victory, and fear arises from the <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> of overcoming. Lastly, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> arises from daring: for no one is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> while seeking vengeance, unless he dare to avenge himself, as <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a> observes in the sixth book of his Physics. Accordingly, it is evident that hope is the first of all the irascible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.

<p>And if we wish to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the order of all the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> in the way of generation, love and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> are first; desire and aversion, second; hope and <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, third; fear and daring, fourth; <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, fifth; sixth and last, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and sadness, which follow from all the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, as stated in Ethic. ii, 5: yet so that love precedes <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>; desire precedes aversion; hope precedes <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>; fear precedes daring; and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> precedes sadness, as may be gathered from what has been stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Because <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> arises from the other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, as an effect from the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> that precede it, it is from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, as being more manifest than the other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, that the power takes its name.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is not the arduousness but the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that is the reason for approach or desire. Consequently hope, which regards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> more directly, takes precedence: although at times daring or even <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> regards something more arduous.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> and directly towards the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as towards its proper object; its movement from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> results from this. For the movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> part is in proportion, not to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> movement, but to the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which intends the end before intending the removal of a contrary, which removal is desired only for the sake of obtaining the end.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether these are the four principal passions: joy, sadness, hope and fear?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, sadness, hope and fear are not the four principal <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei xiv, 3,[7 sqq.) omits hope and puts desire in its place.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, there is a twofold order in the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: the order of <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, and the order of execution or generation. The principal <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> should therefore be taken, either in the order of <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>; and thus <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and sadness, which are the final <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, will be the principal <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>; or in the order of execution or generation, and thus love will be the principal passion. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and sadness, hope and fear should in no way be called the four principal <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as daring is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by hope, so fear is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>. Either, therefore, hope and <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> should be reckoned as principal <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, since they <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> others: or hope and daring, from being akin to one another.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> (De Consol. i) in enumerating the four principal <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, says: "Banish <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joys</a>: banish <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a>: Away with hope: away with tears."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> These four are commonly called the principal <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Two of them, viz. <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and sadness, are said to be principal because in them all the other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> have their completion and end; wherefore they arise from all the other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, as is stated in Ethic. ii, 5. Fear and hope are principal <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, not because they complete the others simply, but because they complete them as regards the movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> towards something: for in respect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, movement begins in love, goes forward to desire, and ends in hope; while in respect of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, it begins in <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, goes on to aversion, and ends in fear. Hence it is customary to distinguish these four <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> in relation to the present and the future: for movement regards the future, while rest is in something present: so that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> relates to present <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, sadness relates to present <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; hope regards future <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and fear, future <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p>As to the other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> that regard <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, present or future, they all culminate in these four. For this reason some have said that these four are the principal <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, because they are general <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>; and this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, provided that by hope and fear we understand the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite's</a> common tendency to desire or shun something.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> puts desire or <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> in place of hope, in so far as they seem to regard the same object, viz. some future <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> These are called principal <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, in the order of <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> and completion. And though fear and hope are not the last <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> simply, yet they are the last of those <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> that tend towards something as future. Nor can the argument be pressed any further except in the case of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>: yet neither can <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> be reckoned a principal passion, because it is an effect of daring, which cannot be a principal passion, as we shall state further on (Reply to Objection 3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Despair implies movement away from <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and this is, as it were, <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>: and daring implies movement towards <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; and this too is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>. Consequently these cannot be principal <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>; because that which is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> cannot be said to be principal. And so neither can <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> be called a principal passion, because it arises from daring.
