<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether there is power in God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that power is not in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For as primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is to power, so <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is the first agent, is to act. But primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, considered in itself, is devoid of all act. Therefore, the first agent--namely, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>--is devoid of power.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. vi, 19), better than every power is its act. For form is better than <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; and action than active power, since it is its end. But nothing is better than what is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; because whatsoever is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as was shown above (Question 3, Article 3). Therefore, there is no power in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, Power is the principle of operation. But the divine power is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, since there is nothing <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is no principle. Therefore there is no power in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it was shown above (14, 8; 19, 4) that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and will are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of things. But the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and principle of a thing are identical. We ought not, therefore, to assign power to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but only <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and will.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said: "Thou art mighty, O Lord, and Thy <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is round about Thee" (<a href="../bible/psa088.htm#verse9">Psalm 88:9</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Power is twofold--namely, passive, which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> not at all in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and active, which we must assign to Him in the highest degree. For it is manifest that everything, according as it is in act and is perfect, is the active principle of something: whereas everything is passive according as it is deficient and imperfect. Now it was shown above (3, 2; 4, 1 and 2), that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/01125b.htm">pure act</a>, simply and in all ways perfect, nor in Him does any imperfection find place. Whence it most fittingly belongs to Him to be an active principle, and in no way whatsoever to be passive. On the other hand, the notion of active principle is consistent with active power. For active power is the principle of acting upon something else; whereas passive power is the principle of being acted upon by something else, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. v, 17). It remains, therefore, that in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is active power in the highest degree.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Active power is not contrary to act, but is founded upon it, for everything acts according as it is actual: but passive power is contrary to act; for a thing is passive according as it is <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a>. Whence this <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> is not in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but only active power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Whenever act is distinct from power, act must be nobler than power. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> action is not distinct from His power, for both are His divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; neither is His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> distinct from His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Hence it does not follow that there should be anything in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> nobler than His power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In creatures, power is the principle not only of action, but likewise of effect. Thus in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of power is retained, inasmuch as it is the principle of an effect; not, however, as it is a principle of action, for this is the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> itself; except, perchance, after our manner of understanding, inasmuch as the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, which pre-contains in itself all perfection that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things, can be understood either under the notion of action, or under that of power; as also it is understood under the notion of "suppositum" possessing <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and under that of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Accordingly the notion of power is retained in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in so far as it is the principle of an effect.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Power is predicated of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> not as something really distinct from His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and will, but as differing from them <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a>; inasmuch as power implies a notion of a principle putting into execution what the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> commands, and what <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> directs, which three things in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are identified. Or we may say, that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according as it is the effective principle, has the notion of power contained in it. Hence the consideration of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> precedes the consideration of His power, as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> precedes the operation and effect.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the power of God is infinite?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. For everything that is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> is imperfect according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Phys. iii, 6). But the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is far from imperfect. Therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every power is made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by its effect; otherwise it would be ineffectual. If, then, the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> were <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, it could produce an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> effect, but this is impossible.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proves (Phys. viii, 79) that if the power of any corporeal thing were <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, it would <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> instantaneous movement. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, however, does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> instantaneous movement, but moves the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> creature in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, and the corporeal creature in place and time, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. 20,22,23). Therefore, His power is not <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (De Trin. viii), that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> power is immeasurable. He is the living mighty one." Now everything that is immeasurable is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. Therefore the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), active power <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> according to the measure in which He is actual. Now His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, inasmuch as it is not limited by anything that receives it, as is clear from what has been said, when we discussed the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> of the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> (7, 1). Wherefore, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the active power in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. For in every agent is it found that the more perfectly an agent has the form by which it acts the greater its power to act. For instance, the hotter a thing is, the greater the power has it to give heat; and it would have <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power to give heat, were its own heat <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. Whence, since the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, through which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> acts, is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, as was shown above (Question 7, Article 1) it follows that His power likewise is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> is here speaking of an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> in regard to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> not limited by any form; and such <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. But the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is otherwise, as was shown above (Question 7, Article 1); and consequently so also His power. It does not follow, therefore, that it is imperfect.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The power of a univocal agent is wholly manifested in its effect. The generative power of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, for example, is not able to do more than beget <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But the power of a non-univocal agent does not wholly manifest itself in the production of its effect: as, for example, the power of the sun does not wholly manifest itself in the production of an animal generated from putrefaction. Now it is clear that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not a univocal agent. For nothing agrees with Him either in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> or in genus, as was shown above (3, 5; 4, 3). Whence it follows that His effect is always less than His power. It is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, therefore, that the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should be manifested so as to produce an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> effect. Yet even if it were to produce no effect, the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would not be ineffectual; because a thing is ineffectual which is ordained towards an end to which it does not attain. But the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not ordered toward its effect as towards an end; rather, it is the end of the effect produced by it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Phys. viii, 79) proves that if a body had <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power, it would <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a non-temporal movement. And he shows that the power of the mover of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, because it can move in an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> time. It remains, therefore, according to his reckoning, that the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power of a body, if such <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, would move without time; not, however, the power of an incorporeal mover. The reason of this is that one body moving another is a univocal agent; wherefore it follows that the whole power of the agent is made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in its motion. Since then the greater the power of a moving body, the more quickly does it move; the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> conclusion is that if its power were <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, it would move beyond comparison faster, and this is to move without time. An incorporeal mover, however, is not a univocal agent; whence it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the whole of its power should be manifested in motion, so as to move without time; and especially since it moves in accordance with the disposition of its will.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether God is omnipotent?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>. For movement and passiveness belong to everything. But this is impossible with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for He is immovable, as was said above (Question 2, Article 3). Therefore He is not <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is an act of some kind. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, nor "deny Himself" as it is said in <a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse13">2 Timothy 2:13</a>. Therefore He is not <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that He manifests His omnipotence "especially by sparing and having mercy" [Collect, 10th Sunday after Pentecost]. Therefore the greatest act possible to the divine power is to spare and have mercy. There are things much greater, however, than sparing and having mercy; for example, to create another world, and the like. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, upon the text, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath made foolish the wisdom of this world" (<a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse20">1 Corinthians 1:20</a>), a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath made the wisdom of this world foolish [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Hath not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>', etc.] by showing those things to be possible which it judges to be impossible." Whence it would seem that nothing is to be judged possible or impossible in reference to inferior <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, as the wisdom of this world judges them; but in reference to the divine power. If <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then, were <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>, all things would be possible; nothing, therefore impossible. But if we take away the impossible, then we destroy also the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>; for what <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> is impossible not to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>. Therefore there would be nothing at all that is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in things if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> were <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>. But this is an impossibility. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said: "No word shall be impossible with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse37">Luke 1:37</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> All confess that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>; but it seems difficult to explain in what His omnipotence precisely consists: for there may be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to the precise meaning of the word 'all' when we say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can do all things. If, however, we consider the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> aright, since power is said in reference to possible things, this phrase, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can do all things," is rightly understood to mean that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can do all things that are possible; and for this reason He is said to be <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>. Now according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. v, 17), a thing is said to be possible in two ways.

<p>First in relation to some power, thus whatever is subject to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> power is said to be possible to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p>Secondly absolutely, on account of the relation in which the very terms stand to each other. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be said to be <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> through being able to do all things that are possible to <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; for the divine power extends farther than that. If, however, we were to say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> because He can do all things that are possible to His power, there would be a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> circle in explaining the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of His power. For this would be saying nothing else but that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>, because He can do all that He is able to do.

<p>It remains therefore, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is called <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> because He can do all things that are possible absolutely; which is the second way of saying a thing is possible. For a thing is said to be possible or impossible absolutely, according to the relation in which the very terms stand to one another, possible if the predicate is not incompatible with the subject, as that <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> sits; and absolutely impossible when the predicate is altogether incompatible with the subject, as, for instance, that a man is a donkey.

<p>It must, however, be remembered that since every agent produces an effect like itself, to each active power there corresponds a thing possible as its proper object according to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of that act on which its active power is founded; for instance, the power of giving warmth is related as to its proper object to the being capable of being warmed. The divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, however, upon which the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of power in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is founded, is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, and is not limited to any genus of being; but possesses within itself the perfection of all being. Whence, whatsoever has or can have the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of being, is numbered among the absolutely possible things, in respect of which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is called <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>. Now nothing is opposed to the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of being except non-being. Therefore, that which implies being and non-being at the same time is repugnant to the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of an absolutely possible thing, within the scope of the divine omnipotence. For such cannot come under the divine omnipotence, not because of any defect in the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but because it has not the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a feasible or possible thing. Therefore, everything that does not imply a contradiction in terms, is numbered amongst those possible things, in respect of which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is called <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>: whereas whatever implies contradiction does not come within the scope of divine omnipotence, because it cannot have the aspect of possibility. Hence it is better to say that such things cannot be done, than that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot do them. Nor is this contrary to the word of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, saying: "No word shall be impossible with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." For whatever implies a contradiction cannot be a word, because no <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can possibly conceive such a thing.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said to be <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> in respect to His active power, not to passive power, as was shown above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Whence the fact that He is immovable or impassible is not repugnant to His omnipotence.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> To <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is to fall short of a perfect action; hence to be able to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is to be able to fall short in action, which is repugnant to omnipotence. Therefore it is that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because of His omnipotence. Nevertheless, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Topic. iv, 3) that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can deliberately do what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But this must be understood either on a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, the antecedent of which is impossible--as, for instance, if we were to say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things if He will. For there is no reason why a conditional proposition should not be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, though both the antecedent and consequent are impossible: as if one were to say: "If <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is a donkey, he has four feet." Or he may be understood to mean that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can do some things which now seem to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: which, however, if He did them, would then be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Or he is, perhaps, speaking after the common manner of the heathen, who thought that men became gods, like Jupiter or Mercury.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> omnipotence is particularly shown in sparing and having mercy, because in this is it made manifest that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has supreme power, that He freely forgives <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For it is not for one who is bound by laws of a superior to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of his own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>. Or, because by sparing and having mercy upon men, He leads them on to the participation of an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; which is the ultimate effect of the divine power. Or because, as was said above (Question 21, Article 4), the effect of the divine mercy is the foundation of all the divine works. For nothing is due to anyone, except on account of something already given him gratuitously by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In this way the divine omnipotence is particularly made manifest, because to it pertains the first foundation of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The absolute possible is not so called in reference either to higher <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, or to inferior <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, but in reference to itself. But the possible in reference to some power is named possible in reference to its proximate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Hence those things which it belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone to do immediately--as, for example, to create, to justify, and the like--are said to be possible in reference to a higher <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Those things, however, which are of such kind as to be done by inferior <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> are said to be possible in reference to those inferior <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. For it is according to the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the proximate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that the effect has contingency or <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, as was shown above (14, 1, ad 2). Thus is it that the wisdom of the world is deemed foolish, because what is impossible to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it judges to be impossible to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. So it is clear that the omnipotence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not take away from things their impossibility and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether God can make the past not to have been?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can make the past not to have been. For what is impossible in itself is much more impossible than that which is only impossible <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can do what is impossible in itself, as to give sight to the blind, or to raise the dead. Therefore, and much more can He do what is only impossible <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>. Now for the past not to have been is impossible <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>: thus for <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> not to be running is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> impossible, from the fact that his running is a thing of the past. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can make the past not to have been.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> could do, He can do now, since His power is not lessened. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> could have effected, before <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> ran, that he should not run. Therefore, when he has run, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> could effect that he did not run.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is a more excellent <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can supply <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> that is lost; therefore also lost <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. Therefore He can so effect that what was corrupt should not have been corrupt.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (Ep. 22 ad Eustoch.): "Although <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can do all things, He cannot make a thing that is corrupt not to have been corrupted." Therefore, for the same reason, He cannot effect that anything else which is past should not have been.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was said above (Question 7, Article 2), there does not fall under the scope of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> omnipotence anything that implies a contradiction. Now that the past should not have been implies a contradiction. For as it implies a contradiction to say that <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> is sitting, and is not sitting, so does it to say that he sat, and did not sit. But to say that he did sit is to say that it happened in the past. To say that he did not sit, is to say that it did not happen. Whence, that the past should not have been, does not come under the scope of divine power. This is what <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> means when he says (Contra Faust. xxix, 5): "Whosoever says, If <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is almighty, let Him make what is done as if it were not done, does not see that this is to say: If <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is almighty let Him effect that what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, by the very fact that it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>": and the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vi, 2): "Of this one thing alone is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> deprived--namely, to make undone the things that have been done."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although it is impossible <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> for the past not to have been, if one considers the past thing itself, as, for instance, the running of <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a>; nevertheless, if the past thing is considered as past, that it should not have been is impossible, not only in itself, but absolutely since it implies a contradiction. Thus, it is more impossible than the raising of the dead; in which there is nothing contradictory, because this is reckoned impossible in reference to some power, that is to say, some <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power; for such impossible things do come beneath the scope of divine power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in accordance with the perfection of the divine power, can do all things, and yet some things are not subject to His power, because they fall short of being possible; so, also, if we regard the immutability of the divine power, whatever <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> could do, He can do now. Some things, however, at one time were in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of possibility, whilst they were yet to be done, which now fall short of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of possibility, when they have been done. So is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> said not to be able to do them, because they themselves cannot be done.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can remove all corruption of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> and body from a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who has fallen; but the fact that she had been corrupt cannot be removed from her; as also is it impossible that the fact of having <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> or having lost <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> thereby can be removed from the sinner.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether God can do what He does not?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot do other than what He does. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot do what He has not foreknown and pre-ordained that He would do. But He neither foreknew nor pre-ordained that He would do anything except what He does. Therefore He cannot do except what He does.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can only do what ought to be done and what is right to be done. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not bound to do what He does not; nor is it right that He should do what He does not. Therefore He cannot do except what He does.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot do anything that is not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and befitting creation. But it is not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for creatures nor befitting them to be otherwise than as they are. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot do except what He does.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said: "Thinkest thou that I cannot ask My Father, and He will give Me presently more than twelve legions of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>?" (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse53">Matthew 26:53</a>). But He neither asked for them, nor did His Father show them to refute the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can do what He does not.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In this matter certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erred</a> in two ways. Some laid it down that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> acts from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> in such way that as from the action of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> nothing else can happen beyond what actually takes place--as, for instance, from the seed of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, a man must come, and from that of an olive, an olive; so from the divine operation there could not result other things, nor another order of things, than that which now is. But we showed above (Question 19, Article 3) that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not act from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, but that His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all things; nor is that will <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> and from any <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> determined to those things. Whence in no way at all is the present course of events produced by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from any <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, so that other things could not happen. Others, however, said that the divine power is restricted to this present course of events through the order of the divine wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> without which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does nothing. But since the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, is nothing else but His wisdom, it can indeed be fittingly said that there is nothing in the divine power which is not in the order of the divine wisdom; for the divine wisdom includes the whole potency of the divine power. Yet the order placed in creation by divine wisdom, in which order the notion of His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> consists, as said above (Question 21, Article 2), is not so adequate to the divine wisdom that the divine wisdom should be restricted to this present order of things. Now it is clear that the whole <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of order which a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> puts into things made by him is taken from their end. So, when the end is proportionate to the things made for that end, the wisdom of the maker is restricted to some definite order. But the divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is an end exceeding beyond all proportion things <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>. Whence the divine wisdom is not so restricted to any particular order that no other course of events could happen. Wherefore we must simply say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can do other things than those He has done.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In ourselves, in whom power and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> are distinct from will and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and again <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> from wisdom, and will from <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, there can be something in the power which is not in the just will nor in the wise <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. But in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, power and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, will and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, are one and the same. Whence, there can be nothing in the divine power which cannot also be in His just will or in His wise <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Nevertheless, because His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> cannot be determined from <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> to this or that order of things, except upon supposition, as was said above (Question 19, Article 3), neither are the wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> restricted to this present order, as was shown above; so nothing prevents there being something in the divine power which He does not will, and which is not included in the order which He has place in things. Again, because power is considered as executing, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as commanding, and the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and wisdom as directing; what is attributed to His power considered in itself, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said to be able to do in accordance with His absolute power. Of such a kind is everything which has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of being, as was said above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). What is, however, attributed to the divine power, according as it carries into execution the command of a just will, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said to be able to do by His ordinary power. In this manner, we must say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can do other things by His absolute power than those He has foreknown and pre-ordained He would do. But it could not happen that He should do anything which He had not foreknown, and had not pre-ordained that He would do, because His actual doing is subject to His foreknowledge and pre-ordination, though His power, which is His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, is not so. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does things because He wills so to do; yet the power to do them does not come from His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, but from His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is bound to nobody but Himself. Hence, when it is said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can only do what He ought, nothing else is meant by this than that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can do nothing but what is befitting to Himself, and just. But these words "befitting" and "just" may be understood in two ways: one, in direct connection with the verb "is"; and thus they would be restricted to the present order of things; and would concern His power. Then what is said in the objection is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>; for the sense is that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can do nothing except what is now fitting and just. If, however, they be joined directly with the verb "can" (which has the effect of extending the meaning), and then secondly with "is," the present will be signified, but in a confused and general way. The sentence would then be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in this sense: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot do anything except that which, if He did it, would be suitable and just."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although this order of things be restricted to what now <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>, the divine power and wisdom are not thus restricted. Whence, although no other order would be suitable and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the things which now are, yet <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can do other things and impose upon them another order.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether God can do better than what He does?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot do better than He does. For whatever <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does, He does in a most powerful and wise way. But a thing is so much the better done as it is more powerfully and wisely done. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot do anything better than He does.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> thus argues (Contra Maximin. iii, 8): "If <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> could, but would not, beget a Son His equal, He would have been <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a>." For the same reason, if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> could have made better things than He has done, but was not willing so to do, He would have been <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is far removed from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> makes everything of the best. He cannot therefore make anything better than He does.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, what is very <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and the best of all cannot be bettered; because nothing is better than the best. But as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion 10), "each thing that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has made is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and, taken all together they are very <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; because in them all consists the wondrous beauty of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> could not be made better by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and has the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> without measure; and so He cannot be better. Again <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is described as the highest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and thus cannot be better. And the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin Mary</a> is raised above all the choirs of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and so cannot be better than she is. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot therefore make all things better than He has made them.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse20">Ephesians 3:20</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is able to do all things more abundantly than we desire or understand."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of anything is twofold; one, which is of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of it--thus, for instance, to be rational pertains to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. As regards this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot make a thing better than it is itself; although He can make another thing better than it; even as He cannot make the number four greater than it is; because if it were greater it would no longer be four, but another number. For the addition of a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> difference in definitions is after the manner of the addition of unity of numbers (Metaph. viii, 10). Another kind of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is that which is over and above the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; thus, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of a man is to be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> or wise. As regards this kind of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can make better the things He has made. Absolutely speaking, however, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can make something else better than each thing made by Him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> When it is said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can make a thing better than He makes it, if "better" is taken substantively, this proposition is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. For He can always make something else better than each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> thing: and He can make the same thing in one way better than it is, and in another way not; as was explained above. If, however, "better" is taken as an adverb, implying the manner of the making; thus <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot make anything better than He makes it, because He cannot make it from greater wisdom and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. But if it implies the manner of the thing done, He can make something better; because He can give to things made by Him a better manner of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> as regards the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, although not as regards the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a son that he should be equal to his father, when he comes to maturity. But it is not of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of anything <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>, that it should be better than it was made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence the comparison fails.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, the present creation being supposed, cannot be better, on account of the most beautiful order given to things by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; in which the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> consists. For if any one thing were bettered, the proportion of order would be destroyed; as if one string were stretched more than it ought to be, the melody of the harp would be destroyed. Yet <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> could make other things, or add something to the present creation; and then there would be another and a better <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The humanity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, from the fact that it is united to the Godhead; and <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> from the fact that it is the fruition of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> from the fact that she is the mother of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; have all a certain <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> dignity from the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And on this account there cannot be anything better than these; just as there cannot be anything better than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.
