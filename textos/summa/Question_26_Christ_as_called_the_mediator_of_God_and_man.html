<h1>Question 26. Christ as called the mediator of God and man</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/4026.htm#article1"> Is it proper to Christ to be the Mediator of God and man?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4026.htm#article2"> Does this belong to Him by reason of His human nature?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether it is proper to Christ to be the Mediator of God and man?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is not proper to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be the Mediator of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> seem to be mediators between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, according to <a href="../bible/deu005.htm#verse5">Deuteronomy 5:5</a>: "I was the mediator and stood between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'the Lord'] and you at that time." But it is not proper to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and a prophet. Neither, therefore, is it proper to Him to be Mediator.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which is fitting to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, both <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and bad, cannot be said to be proper to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But to be between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is fitting to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv). It is also fitting to the bad <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>--that is, the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>: for they have something in common with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>--namely, "<a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>"; and something they have in common with men--namely, "passibility of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>" and consequently unhappiness; as appears from what <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei ix, 13,15). Therefore it is not proper to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be a Mediator of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it belongs to the office of Mediator to beseech one of those, between whom he mediates, for the other. But the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as it is written (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse26">Romans 8:26</a>), "asketh" <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "for us with unspeakable groanings." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is a Mediator between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore this is not proper to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse5">1 Timothy 2:5</a>): "There is . . . one Mediator of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Properly speaking, the office of a mediator is to join together and unite those between whom he mediates: for extremes are united in the mean [medio]. Now to unite men to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> perfectively belongs to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, through Whom men are reconciled to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse19">2 Corinthians 5:19</a>: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> reconciling the world to Himself." And, consequently, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> alone is the perfect Mediator of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and men, inasmuch as, by His death, He reconciled the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>, after saying, "Mediator of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>," added: "Who gave Himself a redemption for all."

<p>However, nothing hinders certain others from being called mediators, in some respect, between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, forasmuch as they cooperate in uniting men to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, dispositively or ministerially.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> were called mediators between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, dispositively and ministerially: inasmuch as they foretold and foreshadowed the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and perfect Mediator of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and men. As to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, they may be called mediators of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and men, inasmuch as they are the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Mediator by administering, in His stead, the saving <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei ix, 13), cannot rightly be called mediators between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and men. "For since, in common with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they have both beatitude and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, and none of these things in common with unhappy and mortal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, how much rather are they not aloof from men and akin to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, than established between them?" <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a>, however, says that they do occupy a middle place, because, in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, they are established below <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and above <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Moreover, they fulfill the office of mediator, not indeed principally and perfectively, but ministerially and dispositively: whence (<a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse11">Matthew 4:11</a>) it is said that "<a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> came and ministered unto Him"--namely, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. As to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that they have <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> in common with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and unhappiness in common with men. "Hence for this purpose does the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and unhappy <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> intervene, in order that he may hinder men from passing to a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>," and may allure them to an unhappy <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. Whence he is like "an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> mediator, who separates friends" [<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, De Civ. Dei xv].

<p>But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had beatitude in common with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, mortality in common with men. Hence "for this purpose did He intervene, that having fulfilled the span of His mortality, He might from dead men make <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>--which He showed in Himself by rising again; and that He might confer beatitude on those who were deprived of it--for which reason He never forsook us." Wherefore He is "the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> Mediator, Who reconciles enemies" (De Civ. Dei xv).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Since the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is in everything equal to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He cannot be said to be between, or a Mediator of, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and men: but <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> alone, Who, though equal to the Father in His Godhead, yet is less than the Father in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as stated above (Question 20, Article 1). Hence on <a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse20">Galatians 3:20</a>, "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is a Mediator [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Now a mediator is not of one, but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is one'," the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "Not the Father nor the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, however, is said "to ask for us," because He makes us ask.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether Christ, is the Mediator of God and men?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the Mediator of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and men. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Felic. x): "One is the Person of Christ: lest there be not one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, not one <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>; lest, the office of Mediator being denied, He be called the Son either of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, or merely the Son of a man." But He is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, not as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but as at the same time <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore neither should we say that, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> alone, He is Mediator of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has a common <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; so, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, He has a common <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> with men. But for the reason that, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He has the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, He cannot be called Mediator, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: for on <a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse5">1 Timothy 2:5</a>, "Mediator of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "As the Word, He is not a Mediator, because He is equal to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> 'with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,' and at the same time one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore neither, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, can He be called Mediator, on account of His having the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as men.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is called Mediator, inasmuch as He reconciled us to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and this He did by taking away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which separated us from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But to take away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, not as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is our Mediator, not as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei ix, 15): "Not because He is the Word, is Christ Mediator, since He Who is supremely <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and supremely <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> is far from us unhappy mortals; but He is Mediator, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We may consider two things in a mediator: first, that he is a mean; secondly, that he unites others. Now it is of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a mean to be distant from each extreme: while it unites by communicating to one that which belongs to the other. Now neither of these can be applied to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but only as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He does not differ from the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and power of dominion: nor have the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> anything that the Son has not, so that He be able to communicate to others something belonging to the Father or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as though it were belonging to others than Himself. But both can be applied to Him as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Because, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, He is distant both from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by dignity of both <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Again, it belongs to Him, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, to unite men to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by communicating to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> both precepts and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, and by offering satisfaction and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for men. And therefore He is most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> called Mediator, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> If we take the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, we consequently take from Him the singular fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which belongs to Him as the Only-begotten of the Father, as it is written (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John 1:14</a>). From which fulness it resulted that He was established over all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and approached nearer to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is in all things equal to the Father. But even in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> He is above all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Therefore, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, He can be Mediator, but not as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although it belongs to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to take away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> authoritatively, yet it belongs to Him, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, to satisfy for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. And in this sense He is called the Mediator of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and men.
