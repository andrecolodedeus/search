<h1>Question 26. The divine beatitude</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1026.htm#article1"> Does beatitude belong to God?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1026.htm#article2"> In regard to what is God called blessed does this regard His act of intellect?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1026.htm#article3"> Is He essentially the beatitude of each of the blessed?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1026.htm#article4"> Is all other beatitude included in the divine beatitude?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether beatitude belongs to God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that beatitude does not belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For beatitude according to <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> (De Consol. iv) "is a state made perfect by the aggregation of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things." But the aggregation of goods has no place in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; nor has composition. Therefore beatitude does not belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, beatitude or <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is the reward of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. i, 9). But reward does not apply to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; as neither does <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. Therefore neither does beatitude.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says: "Which in His times He shall show, who is the Blessed and only Almighty, the King of Kings and Lord of Lords." (<a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse15">1 Timothy 6:15</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Beatitude belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a very special manner. For nothing else is understood to be meant by the term beatitude than the perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; which is capable of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that it has a sufficiency of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which it possesses, to which it is competent that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or ill may befall, and which can control its own actions. All of these things belong in a most excellent manner to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, namely, to be perfect, and to possess <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>. Whence beatitude belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the highest degree.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Aggregation of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, after the manner not of composition, but of simplicity; for those things which in creatures is manifold, pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as was said above (4, 2; 13, 4), in simplicity and unity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It belongs as an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> to beatitude or <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> to be the reward of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, so far as anyone attains to beatitude; even as to be the term of generation belongs <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> to a being, so far as it passes from <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to act. As, then, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has being, though not begotten; so He has beatitude, although not acquired by <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether God is called blessed in respect of His intellect?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not called blessed in respect to His <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. For beatitude is the highest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is said to be in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in regard to His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, because <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> has reference to being which is according to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> (De Hebdom.). Therefore beatitude also is said to be in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in regard to His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, and not to His <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, Beatitude implies the notion of end. Now the end is the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as also is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore beatitude is said to be in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with reference to His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and not with reference to His <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxii, 7): "He is in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, Who whilst He rejoices in Himself, needs not further praise." To be in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, however, is the same as to be blessed. Therefore, since we enjoy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in respect to our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, because "vision is the whole of the reward," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xxii), it would seem that beatitude is said to be in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in respect of His <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Beatitude, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), is the perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Thus it is that, as everything desires the perfection of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> desires <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> to be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>. Now that which is most perfect in any <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> operation, by which in some sense it grasps everything. Whence the beatitude of every <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> consists in understanding. Now in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to be and to understand are one and the same thing; differing only in the manner of our understanding them. Beatitude must therefore be assigned to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in respect of His <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; as also to the blessed, who are called blesses [beati] by reason of the assimilation to His beatitude.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument proves that beatitude belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; not that beatitude pertains <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> to Him under the aspect of His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; but rather under the aspect of His <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Since beatitude is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it is the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; now the object is understood as prior to the act of a power. Whence in our manner of understanding, divine beatitude precedes the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> at rest in it. This cannot be other than the act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; and thus beatitude is to be found in an act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether God is the beatitude of each of the blessed?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the beatitude of each of the blessed. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a>, as was said above (6, 2 and 4). But it is quite impossible that there should be many supreme goods, as also is clear from what has been said above (Question 11, Article 3). Therefore, since it is of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of beatitude that it should be the <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a>, it seems that beatitude is nothing else but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, beatitude is the last end of the rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But to be the last end of the rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> belongs only to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore the beatitude of every blessed is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The beatitude of one is greater than that of another, according to <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse41">1 Corinthians 15:41</a>: "Star differeth from star in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>." But nothing is greater than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore beatitude is something different from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The beatitude of an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> consists in an act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. In this we may consider two things, namely, the object of the act, which is the thing understood; and the act itself which is to understand. If, then, beatitude be considered on the side of the object, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the only beatitude; for everyone is blessed from this sole fact, that he understands <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in accordance with the saying of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Confess. v, 4): "Blessed is he who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> Thee, though he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nought else." But as regards the act of understanding, beatitude is a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> thing in beatified creatures; but in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even in this way, it is an uncreated thing.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Beatitude, as regards its object, is the <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a> absolutely, but as regards its act, in beatified creatures it is their <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a>, not absolutely, but in that kind of goods which a creature can participate.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> End is twofold, namely, "objective" and "subjective," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Greater Ethics i, 3), namely, the "thing itself" and "its use." Thus to a miser the end is money, and its acquisition. Accordingly <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is indeed the last end of a rational creature, as the thing itself; but <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> beatitude is the end, as the use, or rather fruition, of the thing.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether all other beatitude is included in the beatitude of God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the divine beatitude does not embrace all other <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a>. For there are some <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a>. But nothing <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> can be in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore the divine beatitude does not embrace all other <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a certain beatitude, according to some, consists in things corporeal; as in pleasure, <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, and such like. Now none of these have to do with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since He is incorporeal. Therefore His beatitude does not embrace all other <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Beatitude is a certain perfection. But the divine perfection embraces all other perfection, as was shown above (Question 4, Article 2). Therefore the divine beatitude embraces all other <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Whatever is desirable in whatsoever beatitude, whether <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> or <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> wholly and in a more eminent degree in the divine beatitude. As to contemplative <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> possesses a continual and most certain <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of Himself and of all things else; and as to that which is active, He has the governance of the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. As to earthly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, which consists in delight, <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, power, dignity, and fame, according to <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> (De Consol. iii, 10), He possesses <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in Himself and all things else for His delight; instead of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> He has that complete self-sufficiency, which is promised by <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>; in place of power, He has omnipotence; for dignities, the government of all things; and in place of fame, He possesses the admiration of all creatures.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A particular kind of beatitude is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> according as it falls short of the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> beatitude; and thus it is not in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But whatever semblance it has, howsoever slight, of beatitude, the whole of it pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in the divine beatitude.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in things corporeal in a corporeal manner, is also in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but in a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> manner.

<p>We have now spoken enough concerning what pertains to the unity of the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.
