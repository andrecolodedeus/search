<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether there is order in charity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is no order in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But no order is assigned to the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Neither, therefore, should any order be assigned to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the First Truth, so is the object of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> the Sovereign Good. Now no order is appointed for <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but all things are <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> equally. Neither, therefore, ought there to be any order in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: whereas ordering belongs, not to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, but to the reason. Therefore no order should be ascribed to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/son002.htm#verse4">Canticles 2:4</a>): "He brought me into the cellar of wine, he set in order <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> in me."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. v, text. 16), the terms "before" and "after" are used in reference to some principle. Now order implies that certain things are, in some way, before or after. Hence wherever there is a principle, there must needs be also order of some kind. But it has been said above (23, 1; 25, 12) that the love of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> tends to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as to the principle of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, on the fellowship of which the friendship of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is based. Consequently there must needs be some order in things loved out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which order is in reference to the first principle of that love, which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> tends towards the last end considered as last end: and this does not apply to any other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated above (Question 23, Article 6). Now the end has the character of principle in matters of <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> and action, as was shown above (23, 7, ad 2; I-II, 1, ad 1). Wherefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, above all, implies relation to the First Principle, and consequently, in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> above all, we find an order in reference to the First Principle.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> pertains to the cognitive power, whose operation depends on the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> being in the knower. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is in an <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, whose operation consists in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> tending to things themselves. Now order is to be found in things themselves, and flows from them into our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Hence order is more appropriate to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> than to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p>And yet there is a certain order in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in so far as it is chiefly about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and secondarily about things referred to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Order belongs to reason as the faculty that orders, and to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power as to the faculty which is ordered. It is in this way that order is stated to be in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether God ought to be loved more than our neighbor?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> ought not to be loved more than our neighbor. For it is written (<a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse20">1 John 4:20</a>): "He that loveth not his brother whom he seeth, how can he love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Whom he seeth not?" Whence it seems to follow that the more a thing is visible the more lovable it is, since <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> begins with seeing, according to Ethic. ix, 5,12. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is less visible than our neighbor. Therefore He is less lovable, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, than our neighbor.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, likeness <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> love, according to <a href="../bible/sir013.htm#verse19">Sirach 13:19</a>: "Every beast loveth its like." Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> bears more likeness to his neighbor than to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> loves his neighbor, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, more than he loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, what <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> loves in a neighbor, is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Doctr. Christ. i, 22,27). Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not greater in Himself than He is in our neighbor. Therefore He is not more to be loved in Himself than in our neighbor. Therefore we ought not to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more than our neighbor.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A thing ought to be loved more, if others ought to be <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> on its account. Now we ought to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> our neighbor for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake, if, to wit, he leads us astray from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse26">Luke 14:26</a>: "If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> come to Me and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> not his father, and mother, and wife, end children, and brethren, and sisters . . . he cannot be My disciple." Therefore we ought to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, more than our neighbor.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Each kind of friendship regards chiefly the subject in which we chiefly find the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> on the fellowship of which that friendship is based: thus civil friendship regards chiefly the ruler of the state, on whom the entire common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the state depends; hence to him before all, the citizens owe fidelity and obedience. Now the friendship of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is based on the fellowship of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, which consists <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the First Principle, whence it flows to all who are capable of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.

<p>Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> ought to be loved chiefly and before all out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: for He is loved as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, whereas our neighbor is loved as receiving together with us a share of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> from Him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A thing is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of love in two ways: first, as being the reason for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a>. On this way <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of love, since each thing is loved according to its measure of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Secondly, a thing <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> love, as being a way to acquire love. It is in this way that seeing is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a>, not as though a thing were lovable according as it is visible, but because by seeing a thing we are led to love it. Hence it does not follow that what is more visible is more lovable, but that as an object of love we meet with it before others: and that is the sense of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle's</a> argument. For, since our neighbor is more visible to us, he is the first lovable object we meet with, because "the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> learns, from those things it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, to love what it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not," as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says in a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> (In Evang. xi). Hence it can be argued that, if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> loves not his neighbor, neither does he love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not because his neighbor is more lovable, but because he is the first thing to demand our love: and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is more lovable by reason of His greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The likeness we have to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> precedes and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the likeness we have to our neighbor: because from the very fact that we share along with our neighbor in something received from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we become like to our neighbor. Hence by reason of this likeness we ought to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more than we love our neighbor.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Considered in His <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is equally in all, in whomsoever He may be, for He is not lessened by being in anything. And yet our neighbor does not possess <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> equally with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, and our neighbor by participation.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether out of charity, man is bound to love God more than himself?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not bound, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more than himself. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ix, 8) that "a man's friendly relations with others arise from his friendly relations with himself." Now the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is stronger than its effect. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> friendship towards himself is greater than his friendship for anyone else. Therefore he ought to love himself more than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, one loves a thing in so far as it is one's own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now the reason for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> a thing is more loved than the thing itself which is loved for that reason, even as the principles which are the reason for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> a thing are more <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> loves himself more than any other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> loved by him. Therefore he does not love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more than himself.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a man loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as much as he loves to enjoy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But a man loves himself as much as he loves to enjoy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; since this is the highest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> a man can wish for himself. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not bound, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more than himself.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 22): "If thou oughtest to love thyself, not for thy own sake, but for the sake of Him in Whom is the rightest end of thy love, let no other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> take offense if him also thou lovest for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake." Now "the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a thing being such is yet more so." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ought to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more than himself.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> we receive from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is twofold, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Now the fellowship of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> goods bestowed on us by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the foundation of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love, in virtue of which not only <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, so long as his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> remains unimpaired, loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> above all things and more than himself, but also every single creature, each in its own way, i.e. either by an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, or by a rational, or by an animal, or at least by a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love, as stones do, for instance, and other things bereft of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, because each part <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> loves the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the whole more than its own particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. This is evidenced by its operation, since the principal inclination of each part is towards common action conducive to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the whole. It may also be seen in civic <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> whereby sometimes the citizens suffer damage even to their own property and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> for the sake of the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Wherefore much more is this realized with regard to the friendship of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> which is based on the fellowship of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p>Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ought, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of all, more than himself: since <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as in the universal and fountain principle of all who are able to have a share of that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> is speaking of friendly relations towards another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in whom the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is the object of friendship, resides in some restricted way; and not of friendly relations with another in whom the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> resides in totality.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The part does indeed love the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the whole, as becomes a part, not however so as to refer the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the whole to itself, but rather itself to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the whole.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> That a man wishes to enjoy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> pertains to that love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> which is love of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. Now we love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with the love of friendship more than with the love of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, because the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is greater in itself, than our share of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in enjoying Him. Hence, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> simply loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more than himself.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether our of charity, man ought to love himself more than his neighbor?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a man ought not, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, to love himself more than his neighbor. For the principal object of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated above (2; 25, 1,12). Now sometimes our neighbor is more closely united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than we are ourselves. Therefore we ought to love such a one more than ourselves.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the more we love a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, the more we avoid injuring him. Now a man, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, submits to injury for his neighbor's sake, according to <a href="../bible/pro012.htm#verse26">Proverbs 12:26</a>: "He that neglecteth a loss for the sake of a friend, is just." Therefore a man ought, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, to love his neighbor more than himself.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse5">1 Corinthians 13:5</a>) "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> seeketh not its own." Now the thing we love most is the one whose <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> we seek most. Therefore a man does not, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, love himself more than his neighbor.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse18">Leviticus 19:18</a>, <a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse39">Matthew 22:39</a>): "Thou shalt love thy neighbor (<a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse18">Leviticus 19:18</a>: 'friend') as thyself." Whence it seems to follow that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> love for himself is the model of his love for another.

<p>But the model exceeds the copy. Therefore, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, a man ought to love himself more than his neighbor.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There are two things in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, his <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and his corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. And a man is said to love himself by reason of his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> himself with regard to his <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as stated above (Question 25, Article 7): so that accordingly, a man ought, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, to love himself more than he loves any other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p>This is evident from the very reason for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a>: since, as stated above (25, 1,12), <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is loved as the principle of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, on which the love of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is founded; while <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, loves himself by reason of his being a partaker of the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and loves his neighbor by reason of his fellowship in that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now fellowship is a reason for love according to a certain union in relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore just as unity surpasses union, the fact that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> himself has a share of the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, is a more potent reason for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> than that another should be a partner with him in that share. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, ought to love himself more than his neighbor: in sign whereof, a man ought not to give way to any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which counteracts his share of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, not even that he may free his neighbor from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The love of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> takes its <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> not only from its object which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but also from the lover, who is the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that has <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, even as the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of any action depends in some way on the subject. Wherefore, though a better neighbor is nearer to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet because he is not as near to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who has <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is to himself, it does not follow that a man is bound to love his neighbor more than himself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ought to bear bodily injury for his friend's sake, and precisely in so doing he loves himself more as regards his <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> mind, because it pertains to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. On <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> matters, however, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ought not to suffer injury by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, in order to free his neighbor from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in his Rule (Ep. ccxi), the saying, "'<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> seeks not her own,' means that it prefers the common to the private <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." Now the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is always more lovable to the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> than his private <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, even as the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the whole is more lovable to the part, than the latter's own partial <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>).

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether a man ought to love his neighbor more than his own body?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a man is not bound to love his neighbor more than his own body. For his neighbor includes his neighbor's body. If therefore a man ought to love his neighbor more than his own body, it follows that he ought to love his neighbor's body more than his own.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a man ought to love his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> more than his neighbor's, as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>). Now a man's own body is nearer to his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> than his neighbor. Therefore we ought to love our body more than our neighbor.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a man imperils that which he loves less for the sake of what he loves more. Now every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not bound to imperil his own body for his neighbor's safety: this belongs to the perfect, according to <a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse13">John 15:13</a>: "Greater love than this no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hath, that a man lay down his life for his friends." Therefore a man is not bound, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, to love his neighbor more than his own body.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 27) that "we ought to love our neighbor more than our own body."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> we ought to love more that which has more fully the reason for being loved out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as stated above (2; 25, 12). Now fellowship in the full participation of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> which is the reason for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> one's neighbor, is a greater reason for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a>, than the participation of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> by way of overflow, which is the reason for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> one's own body. Therefore, as regards the welfare of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> we ought to love our neighbor more than our own body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. ix, 8) a thing seems to be that which is predominant in it: so that when we say that we ought to love our neighbor more than our own body, this refers to his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is his predominant part.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Our body is nearer to our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> than our neighbor, as regards the constitution of our own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: but as regards the participation of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, our neighbor's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is more closely associated with our own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, than even our own body is.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is immediately concerned with the care of his own body, but not with his neighbor's welfare, except perhaps in cases of urgency: wherefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> does not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> require a man to imperil his own body for his neighbor's welfare, except in a case where he is under <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to do so and if a man of his own accord offer himself for that purpose, this belongs to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether we ought to love one neighbor more than another?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that we ought not to love one neighbor more than another. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 28): "One ought to love all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> equally. Since, however, one cannot do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to all, we ought to consider those chiefly who by reason of place, time or any other circumstance, by a kind of chance, are more closely united to us." Therefore one neighbor ought not to be loved more than another.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, where there is one and the same reason for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> several, there should be no inequality of love. Now there is one and the same reason for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> all one's neighbors, which reason is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Doctr. Christ. i, 27). Therefore we ought to love all our neighbors equally.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to love a man is to wish him <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Rhet. ii, 4). Now to all our neighbors we wish an equal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, viz. everlasting life. Therefore we ought to love all our neighbors equally.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> One's <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to love a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is proportionate to the gravity of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> one commits in acting against that love. Now it is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to act against the love of certain neighbors, than against the love of others. Hence the commandment (<a href="../bible/lev010.htm#verse9">Leviticus 10:9</a>), "He that curseth his father or mother, dying let him die," which does not apply to those who <a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">cursed</a> others than the above. Therefore we ought to love some neighbors more than others.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There have been two opinions on this question: for some have said that we ought, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, to love all our neighbors equally, as regards our affection, but not as regards the outward effect. They held that the order of love is to be understood as applying to outward favors, which we ought to confer on those who are connected with us in preference to those who are unconnected, and not to the inward affection, which ought to be given equally to all including our enemies.

<p>But this is unreasonable. For the affection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which is the inclination of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, is not less orderly than the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, which is the inclination of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, for both inclinations flow from Divine wisdom. Now we observe in the physical order that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination in each thing is proportionate to the act or movement that is becoming to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of that thing: thus in earth the inclination of gravity is greater than in water, because it is becoming to earth to be beneath water. Consequently the inclination also of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which is the effect of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, must needs be proportionate to those actions which have to be performed outwardly, so that, to wit, the affection of our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> be more intense towards those to whom we ought to behave with greater kindness.

<p>We must, therefore, say that, even as regards the affection we ought to love one neighbor more than another. The reason is that, since the principle of love is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who loves, it must needs be that the affection of love increases in proportion to the nearness to one or the other of those principles. For as we stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), wherever we find a principle, order depends on relation to that principle.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Love can be unequal in two ways: first on the part of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> we wish our friend. On this respect we love all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> equally out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: because we wish them all one same generic <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, namely everlasting <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Secondly love is said to be greater through its action being more intense: and in this way we ought not to love all equally.

<p>Or we may reply that we have unequal love for certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in two ways: first, through our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> some and not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> others. As regards beneficence we are bound to observe this inequality, because we cannot do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to all: but as regards benevolence, love ought not to be thus unequal. The other inequality arises from our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> some more than others: and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> does not mean to exclude the latter inequality, but the former, as is evident from what he says of beneficence.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Our neighbors are not all equally related to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; some are nearer to Him, by reason of their greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, and those we ought, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, to love more than those who are not so near to Him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument considers the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of love on the part of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which we wish our friends.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether we ought to love those who are better more those who are more closely united us?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that we ought to love those who are better more than those who are more closely united to us. For that which is in no way hateful seems more lovable than that which is hateful for some reason: just as a thing is all the whiter for having less black mixed with it. Now those who are connected with us are hateful for some reason, according to <a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse26">Luke 14:26</a>: "If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> come to Me, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> not his father," etc. On the other hand <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> men are not hateful for any reason. Therefore it seems that we ought to love those who are better more than those who are more closely connected with us.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> above all, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is likened to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> loves more the better <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> also, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, ought to love the better <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> more than one who is more closely united to him.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in every friendship that ought to be loved most which has most to do with the foundation of that friendship: for, by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> friendship we love most those who are connected with us by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, our parents for instance, or our children. Now the friendship of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is founded upon the fellowship of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, which has more to do with better men than with those who are more closely united to us. Therefore, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, we ought to love better men more than those who are more closely connected with us.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse8">1 Timothy 5:8</a>): "If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> have not care of his own and especially of those of his house, he hath denied the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and is worse than an infidel." Now the inward affection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> ought to correspond to the outward effect. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> regards those who are nearer to us before those who are better.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Every act should be proportionate both to its object and to the agent. But from its object it takes its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, while, from the power of the agent it takes the mode of its intensity: thus movement has its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the term to which it tends, while the intensity of its speed arises from the disposition of the thing moved and the power of the mover. Accordingly love takes its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from its object, but its intensity is due to the lover.

<p>Now the object of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity's</a> love is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is the lover. Therefore the specific diversity of the love which is in accordance with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as regards the love of our neighbor, depends on his relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so that, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, we should wish a greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to one who is nearer to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for though the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> wishes to all, viz. everlasting <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, is one in itself, yet it has various degrees according to various shares of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, and it belongs to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> to wish <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to be maintained, in accordance with which better men have a fuller share of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. And this regards the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of love; for there are different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of love according to the different goods that we wish for those whom we love.

<p>On the other hand, the intensity of love is measured with regard to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who loves, and accordingly <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> loves those who are more closely united to him, with more intense affection as to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> he wishes for them, than he loves those who are better as to the greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> he wishes for them.

<p>Again a further difference must be observed here: for some neighbors are connected with us by their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> origin, a connection which cannot be severed, since that origin makes them to be what they are. But the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, wherein some are close to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, can come and go, increase and decrease, as was shown above (24, 4,10,11). Hence it is possible for one, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, to wish this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who is more closely united to one, to be better than another, and so reach a higher degree of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.

<p>Moreover there is yet another reason for which, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, we love more those who are more nearly connected with us, since we love them in more ways. For, towards those who are not connected with us we have no other friendship than <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, whereas for those who are connected with us, we have certain other friendships, according to the way in which they are connected. Now since the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> on which every other friendship of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> is based, is directed, as to its end, to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> on which <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is based, it follows that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> commands each act of another friendship, even as the art which is about the end commands the art which is about the means. Consequently this very act of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> someone because he is akin or connected with us, or because he is a fellow-countryman or for any like reason that is referable to the end of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, can be commanded by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, so that, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> both eliciting and commanding, we love in more ways those who are more nearly connected with us.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> We are commanded to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>, in our kindred, not their kinship, but only the fact of their being an obstacle between us and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In this respect they are not akin but hostile to us, according to <a href="../bible/mic007.htm#verse6">Micah 7:6</a>: "A men's enemies are they of his own household."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> conforms <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> proportionately, by making <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> comport himself towards what is his, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does towards what is His. For we may, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, will certain things as becoming to us which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not will, because it becomes Him not to will them, as stated above (I-II, 19, 10), when we were treating of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> elicits the act of love not only as regards the object, but also as regards the lover, as stated above. The result is that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who is more nearly united to us is more loved.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether we ought to love more those who are connected with us by ties of blood?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that we ought not to love more those who are more closely united to us by ties of blood. For it is written (<a href="../bible/pro018.htm#verse24">Proverbs 18:24</a>): "A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> amiable in society, shall be more friendly than a brother." Again, Valerius Maximus says (Fact. et Dict. Memor. iv 7): "The ties of friendship are most strong and in no way yield to the ties of blood." Moreover it is quite certain and undeniable, that as to the latter, the lot of birth is fortuitous, whereas we contract the former by an untrammelled will, and a solid pledge. Therefore we ought not to love more than others those who are united to us by ties of blood.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Officiis i, 7): "I love not less you whom I have begotten in the Gospel, than if I had begotten you in wedlock, for <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is no more eager to love than <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>." Surely we ought to love those whom we expect to be with us for ever more than those who will be with us only in this world. Therefore we should not love our kindred more than those who are otherwise connected with us.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "Love is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>," as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> states (Hom. in Evang. xxx). Now we are bound to do acts of love to others than our kindred: thus in the army a man must obey his officer rather than his father. Therefore we are not bound to love our kindred most of all.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The commandments of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> contain a special precept about the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> due to our parents (<a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse12">Exodus 20:12</a>). Therefore we ought to love more specially those who are united to us by ties of blood.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#7">Article 7</a>), we ought out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> to love those who are more closely united to us more, both because our love for them is more intense, and because there are more reasons for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> them. Now intensity of love arises from the union of lover and beloved: and therefore we should measure the love of different <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> according to the different kinds of union, so that a man is more loved in matters touching that particular union in respect of which he is loved. And, again, in comparing love to love we should compare one union with another. Accordingly we must say that friendship among blood relations is based upon their connection by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> origin, the friendship of fellow-citizens on their civic fellowship, and the friendship of those who are fighting side by side on the comradeship of battle. Wherefore in matters pertaining to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> we should love our kindred most, in matters concerning relations between citizens, we should prefer our fellow-citizens, and on the battlefield our fellow-soldiers. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ix, 2) that "it is our <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to render to each class of people such respect as is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and appropriate. This is in fact the principle upon which we seem to act, for we invite our relations to a wedding . . . It would seem to be a special <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to afford our parents the means of living . . . and to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> them."

<p>The same applies to other kinds of friendship.

<p>If however we compare union with union, it is evident that the union arising from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> origin is prior to, and more stable than, all others, because it is something affecting the very <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, whereas other unions supervene and may cease altogether. Therefore the friendship of kindred is more stable, while other friendships may be stronger in respect of that which is proper to each of them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In as much as the friendship of comrades originates through their own choice, love of this kind takes precedence of the love of kindred in matters where we are free to do as we choose, for instance in matters of action. Yet the friendship of kindred is more stable, since it is more <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, and preponderates over others in matters touching <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: consequently we are more beholden to them in the providing of necessaries.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> is speaking of love with regard to favors respecting the fellowship of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, namely, moral instruction. For in this matter, a man ought to provide for his <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> children whom he has begotten spiritually, more than for the sons of his body, whom he is bound to support in bodily sustenance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The fact that in the battle a man obeys his officer rather than his father proves, that he loves his father less, not simply but relatively, i.e. as regards the love which is based on fellowship in battle.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether a man ought, out of charity, to love his children more than his father?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that a man ought, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, to love his children more than his father. For we ought to love those more to whom we are more bound to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now we are more bound to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to our children than to our parents, since the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse14">2 Corinthians 12:14</a>): "Neither ought the children to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children." Therefore a man ought to love his children more than his parents.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> perfects <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But parents <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> love their children more than these love them, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. viii, 12). Therefore a man ought to love his children more than his parents.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> affections are conformed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> loves His children more than they love Him. Therefore we also ought to love our children more than our parents.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> [<a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, Hom. ii in Cant.] says: "We ought to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> first, then our parents, then our children, and lastly those of our household."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (4, ad 1; 7), the degrees of love may be measured from two standpoints. First, from that of the object. On this respect the better a thing is, and the more like to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the more is it to be loved: and in this way a man ought to love his father more than his children, because, to wit, he loves his father as his principle, in which respect he is a more exalted <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and more like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>Secondly, the degrees of love may be measured from the standpoint of the lover, and in this respect a man loves more that which is more closely connected with him, in which way a man's children are more lovable to him than his father, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. viii). First, because parents love their children as being part of themselves, whereas the father is not part of his son, so that the love of a father for his children, is more like a man's love for himself. Secondly, because parents <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> better that so and so is their child than vice versa. Thirdly, because children are nearer to their parents, as being part of them, than their parents are to them to whom they stand in the relation of a principle. Fourthly, because parents have loved longer, for the father begins to love his child at once, whereas the child begins to love his father after a lapse of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>; and the longer love lasts, the stronger it is, according to <a href="../bible/sir009.htm#verse14">Sirach 9:14</a>: "Forsake not an old friend, for the new will not be like to him."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The debt due to a principle is submission of respect and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, whereas that due to the effect is one of influence and care. Hence the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of children to their parents consists chiefly in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>: while that of parents to their children is especially one of care.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> for a man as father to love his children more, if we consider them as closely connected with him: but if we consider which is the more exalted <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, the son <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> loves his father more.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 32), <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> loves us for our <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and for His <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. Wherefore since our father is related to us as principle, even as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is, it belongs properly to the father to receive <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> from his children, and to the children to be provided by their parents with what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for them. Nevertheless in cases of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> the child is bound out of the favors received to provide for his parents before all.

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether a man ought to love his mother more than his father?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a man ought to love his mother more than his father. For, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Gener. Animal. i, 20), "the female produces the body in generation." Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> receives his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, not from his father, but from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by creation, as stated in I, 90, 2;118. Therefore a man receives more from his mother than from his father: and consequently he ought to love her more than him.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, where greater love is given, greater love is due. Now a mother loves her child more than the father does: for the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ix, 7) that "mothers have greater love for their children. For the mother labors more in child-bearing, and she <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> more surely than the father who are her children."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, love should be more fond towards those who have labored for us more, according to <a href="../bible/rom016.htm#verse6">Romans 16:6</a>: "Salute Mary, who hath labored much among you." Now the mother labors more than the father in giving birth and education to her child; wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/sir007.htm#verse29">Sirach 7:29</a>): "Forget not the groanings of thy mother." Therefore a man ought to love his mother more than his father.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on <a href="../bible/eze044.htm#verse25">Ezekiel 44:25</a> that "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ought to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father of all, and then his own father," and mentions the mother afterwards.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In making such comparisons as this, we must take the answer in the strict sense, so that the present question is whether the father as father, ought to be loved more than the mother as mother. The reason is that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> may make such a difference in such like matters, that friendship may be diminished or destroyed, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> remarks (Ethic. viii, 7). Hence <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> [<a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, Hom. ii in Cant.] says: "Good servants should be preferred to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> children."

<p>Strictly speaking, however, the father should be loved more than the mother. For father and mother are loved as principles of our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> origin. Now the father is principle in a more excellent way than the mother, because he is the active principle, while the mother is a passive and material principle. Consequently, strictly speaking, the father is to be loved more.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In the begetting of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the mother supplies the formless <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the body; and the latter receives its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> through the formative power that is in the semen of the father. And though this power cannot create the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, yet it disposes the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the body to receive that form.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This applies to another kind of love. For the friendship between lover and lover differs specifically from the friendship between child and parent: while the friendship we are speaking of here, is that which a man owes his father and mother through being begotten of them.

<p>The Reply to the Third Objection is evident.

<h2 id="article11">Article 11. Whether a man ought to love his wife more than his father and mother?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a man ought to love his wife more than his father and mother. For no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> leaves a thing for another unless he love the latter more. Now it is written (<a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse24">Genesis 2:24</a>) that "a man shell leave father and mother" on account of his wife. Therefore a man ought to love his wife more than his father and mother.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse33">Ephesians 5:33</a>) that a husband should "love his wife as himself." Now a man ought to love himself more than his parents. Therefore he ought to love his wife also more than his parents.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, love should be greater where there are more reasons for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a>. Now there are more reasons for love in the friendship of a man towards his wife. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. viii, 12) that "in this friendship there are the motives of utility, pleasure, and also of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, if husband and wife are <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>." Therefore a man's love for his wife ought to be greater than his love for his parents.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> According to <a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse28">Ephesians 5:28</a>, "men ought to love their wives as their own bodies." Now a man ought to love his body less than his neighbor, as stated above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>): and among his neighbors he should love his parents most. Therefore he ought to love his parents more than his wife.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#9">Article 9</a>), the degrees of love may be taken from the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> (which is loved), or from the union between those who love. On the part of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is the object loved, a man should love his parents more than his wife, because he loves them as his principles and considered as a more exalted <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p>But on the part of the union, the wife ought to be loved more, because she is united with her husband, as one flesh, according to <a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse6">Matthew 19:6</a>: "Therefore now they are not two, but one flesh." Consequently a man loves his wife more intensely, but his parents with greater reverence.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not in all respects leave his father and mother for the sake of his wife: for in certain cases a man ought to succor his parents rather than his wife. He does however leave all his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">kinsfolk</a>, and cleaves to his wife as regards the union of carnal connection and co-habitation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The words of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> do not mean that a man ought to love his wife equally with himself, but that a man's love for himself is the reason for his love of his wife, since she is one with him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There are also several reasons for a man's love for his father; and these, in a certain respect, namely, as regards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, are more weighty than those for which a man loves his wife; although the latter outweigh the former as regards the closeness of the union.

<p>As to the argument in the contrary sense, it must be observed that in the words quoted, the particle "as" denotes not equality of love but the motive of love. For the principal reason why a man loves his wife is her being united to him in the flesh.

<h2 id="article12">Article 12. Whether a man ought to love more his benefactor than one he has benefited?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a man ought to love his benefactor more than one he has benefited. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Catech. Rud. iv): "Nothing will incite another more to love you than that you love him first: for he must have a hard heart indeed, who not only refuses to love, but declines to return love already given." Now a man's benefactor forestalls him in the kindly <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore we ought to love our benefactors above all.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the more grievously we <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by ceasing to love a man or by working against him, the more ought we to love him. Now it is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to cease <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> a benefactor or to work against him, than to cease <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> one to whom one has hitherto done kindly actions. Therefore we ought to love our benefactors more than those to whom we are kind.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, of all things lovable, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is to be loved most, and then one's father, as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says [Comment. in Ezechiel xliv, 25]. Now these are our greatest benefactors. Therefore a benefactor should be loved above all others.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ix, 7), that "benefactors seem to love recipients of their benefactions, rather than vice versa."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (A9,11), a thing is loved more in two ways: first because it has the character of a more excellent <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, secondly by reason of a closer connection. On the first way we ought to love our benefactor most, because, since he is a principle of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> he has benefited, he has the character of a more excellent <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as stated above with regard to one's father (9).

<p>In the second way, however, we love those more who have received benefactions from us, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proves (Ethic. ix, 7) by four arguments. First because the recipient of benefactions is the handiwork of the benefactor, so that we are wont to say of a man: "He was made by so and so." Now it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to a man to love his own work (thus it is to be observed that poets love their own poems): and the reason is that we love "to be" and "to live," and these are made manifest in our "action." Secondly, because we all <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> love that in which we see our own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the benefactor has some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of his in the recipient of his benefaction, and the recipient some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in the benefactor; but the benefactor sees his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in the recipient, while the recipient sees his useful <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in the benefactor. Now it gives more pleasure to see one's <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> than one's useful <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, both because it is more enduring for usefulness quickly flits by, and the pleasure of calling a thing to mind is not like the pleasure of having it present and because it is more pleasant to recall <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> goods than the profit we have derived from others. Thirdly, because is it the lover's part to act, since he wills and works the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the beloved, while the beloved takes a passive part in receiving <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, so that to love surpasses being loved, for which reason the greater love is on the part of the benefactor. Fourthly because it is more difficult to give than to receive favors: and we are most fond of things which have cost us most trouble, while we almost despise what comes easy to us.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is some thing in the benefactor that incites the recipient to love him: whereas the benefactor loves the recipient, not through being incited by him, but through being moved thereto of his own accord: and what we do of our own accord surpasses what we do through another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The love of the beneficiary for the benefactor is more of a <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, wherefore the contrary is the greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. On the other hand, the love of the benefactor for the beneficiary is more spontaneous, wherefore it is quicker to act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> also loves us more than we love Him, and parents love their children more than these love them. Yet it does not follow that we love all who have received <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> from us, more than any of our benefactors. For we prefer such benefactors as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and our parents, from whom we have received the greatest favors, to those on whom we have bestowed lesser benefits.

<h2 id="article13">Article 13. Whether the order of charity endures in heaven?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the order of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> does not endure in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Vera Relig. xlviii): "Perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> consists in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> greater goods more, and lesser goods less." Now <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> will be perfect in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Therefore a man will love those who are better more than either himself or those who are connected with him.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, we love more him to whom we wish a greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now each one in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> wishes a greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for those who have more <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, else his will would not be conformed in all things to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will: and there to be better is to have more <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> each one loves more those who are better, and consequently he loves others more than himself, and one who is not connected with him, more than one who is.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> love will be entirely for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake, for then will be fulfilled the words of <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse28">1 Corinthians 15:28</a>: "That <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may be all in all." Therefore he who is nearer <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will be loved more, so that a man will love a better <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> more than himself, and one who is not connected with him, more than one who is.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> is not done away, but perfected, by <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Now the order of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> given above (A2,3,4) is derived from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: since all things <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> love themselves more than others. Therefore this order of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> will endure in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The order of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> must needs remain in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, as regards the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> above all things. For this will be realized simply when <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall enjoy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> perfectly. But, as regards the order between <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> himself and other men, a distinction would seem to be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, because, as we stated above (A7,9), the degrees of love may be distinguished either in respect of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which a man desires for another, or according to the intensity of love itself. On the first way a man will love better men more than himself, and those who are less <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, less than himself: because, by reason of the perfect conformity of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> to the Divine will, each of the blessed will desire everyone to have what is due to him according to Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Nor will that be a time for advancing by means of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> to a yet greater reward, as happens now while it is possible for a man to desire both the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and the reward of a better <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, whereas then the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of each one will rest within the limits determined by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But in the second way a man will love himself more than even his better neighbors, because the intensity of the act of love arises on the part of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who loves, as stated above (A7,9). Moreover it is for this that the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is bestowed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on each one, namely, that he may first of all direct his mind to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and this pertains to a man's love for himself, and that, in the second place, he may wish other things to be directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and even work for that end according to his capacity.

<p>As to the order to be observed among our neighbors, a man will simply love those who are better, according to the love of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Because the entire life of the blessed consists in directing their <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, wherefore the entire ordering of their love will be ruled with respect to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so that each one will love more and reckon to be nearer to himself those who are nearer to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For then one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will no longer succor another, as he needs to in the present life, wherein each <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has to succor those who are closely connected with him rather than those who are not, no <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> what be the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of their distress: hence it is that in this life, a man, by the inclination of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, loves more those who are more closely united to him, for he is under a greater <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to bestow on them the effect of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. It will however be possible in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> for a man to love in several ways one who is connected with him, since the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> love will not be banished from the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the blessed. Yet all these reasons are incomparably surpassed by that which is taken from nighness to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument should be granted as to those who are connected together; but as regards <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> himself, he ought to love himself so much the more than others, as his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is more perfect, since perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> directs <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> perfectly, and this belongs to love of oneself, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument considers the order of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> in respect of the degree of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> one wills the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> one loves.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will be to each one the entire reason of his love, for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> entire <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. For if we make the impossible supposition that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> were not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, He would not be <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> reason for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a>. Hence it is that in the order of love <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should love himself more than all else after <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.
