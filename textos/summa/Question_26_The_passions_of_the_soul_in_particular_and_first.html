<h1>Question 26. The passions of the soul in particular: and first, of love</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2026.htm#article1"> Is love in the concupiscible power?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2026.htm#article2"> Is love a passion?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2026.htm#article3"> Is love the same as dilection?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2026.htm#article4"> Is love properly divided into love of friendship, and love of concupiscence?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether love is in the concupiscible power?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that love is not in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> power. For it is written (<a href="../bible/wis008.htm#verse2">Wisdom 8:2</a>): "Her," namely wisdom, "have I loved, and have sought her out from my youth." But the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> power, being a part of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, cannot tend to wisdom, which is not apprehended by the senses. Therefore love is not in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> power.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, love seems to be identified with every <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>: for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 7): "Love, yearning for the object beloved, is desire; having and enjoying it, is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>; fleeing what is contrary to it, is fear; and feeling what is contrary to it, is sadness." But not every <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> power; indeed, fear, which is mentioned in this passage, is in the irascible power. Therefore we must not say absolutely that love is in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> power.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. iv) mentions a "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love." But <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love seems to pertain rather to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers, which belong to the vegetal <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore love is not simply in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> power.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Topic. ii, 7) that "love is in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> power."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Love is something pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; since <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is the object of both. Wherefore love differs according to the difference of appetites. For there is an <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> which arises from an apprehension <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a>, not in the subject of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, but in some other: and this is called the "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>." Because <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things seek what is suitable to them according to their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, by reason of an apprehension which is not in them, but in the Author of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as stated in the I, 6, 1, ad 2; I, 103, 1, ad 1,3. And there is another <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> arising from an apprehension in the subject of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, but from <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> and not from <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. Such is, in irrational animals, the "sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>," which, however, in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, has a certain share of liberty, in so far as it obeys reason. Again, there is another <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> following freely from an apprehension in the subject of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. And this is the rational or <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, which is called the "will."

<p>Now in each of these appetites, the name "love" is given to the principle movement towards the end loved. In the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> the principle of this movement is the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> subject's connaturalness with the thing to which it tends, and may be called "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love": thus the connaturalness of a heavy body for the centre, is by reason of its weight and may be called "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love." In like manner the aptitude of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> or of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, that is to say, its very complacency in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is called "sensitive love," or "<a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>" or "rational love." So that sensitive love is in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, just as <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> love is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. And it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> power, because it regards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> absolutely, and not under the aspect of difficulty, which is the object of the irascible faculty.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The words quoted refer to <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> or rational love.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Love is spoken of as being fear, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, desire and sadness, not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> but <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causally</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Natural love is not only in the powers of the vegetal <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but in all the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> powers, and also in all the parts of the body, and universally in all things: because, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv), "Beauty and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> are beloved by all things"; since each single thing has a connaturalness with that which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> suitable to it.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether love is a passion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that love is not a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>. For no power is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>. But every love is a power, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv). Therefore love is not a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, love is a kind of union or bond, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. viii, 10). But a union or bond is not a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, but rather a relation. Therefore love is not a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 22) that passion is a movement. But love does not imply the movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; for this is desire, of which movement love is the principle. Therefore love is not a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. viii, 5) that "love is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> is the effect of the agent on the patient. Now a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> agent produces a twofold effect on the patient: for in the first place it gives it the form; and secondly it gives it the movement that results from the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Thus the generator gives the generated body both weight and the movement resulting from weight: so that weight, from being the principle of movement to the place, which is connatural to that body by reason of its weight, can, in a way, be called "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love." In the same way the appetible object gives the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, first, a certain adaptation to itself, which consists in complacency in that object; and from this follows movement towards the appetible object. For "the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> movement is circular," as stated in De Anima iii, 10; because the appetible object moves the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, introducing itself, as it were, into its <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>; while the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> moves towards the realization of the appetible object, so that the movement ends where it began. Accordingly, the first change wrought in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> by the appetible object is called "love," and is nothing else than complacency in that object; and from this complacency results a movement towards that same object, and this movement is "desire"; and lastly, there is rest which is "<a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>." Since, therefore, love consists in a change wrought in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> by the appetible object, it is evident that love is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>: properly so called, according as it is in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty; in a wider and extended sense, according as it is in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Since power denotes a principle of movement or action, <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> calls love a power, in so far as it is a principle of movement in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Union belongs to love in so far as by reason of the complacency of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, the lover stands in relation to that which he loves, as though it were himself or part of himself. Hence it is clear that love is not the very relation of union, but that union is a result of love. Hence, too, <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says that "love is a unitive force" (Div. Nom. iv), and the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Polit. ii, 1) that union is the work of love.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although love does not denote the movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> in tending towards the appetible object, yet it denotes that movement whereby the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is changed by the appetible object, so as to have complacency therein.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether love is the same as dilection?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that love is the same as dilection. For <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that love is to dilection, "as four is to twice two, and as a rectilinear figure is to one composed of straight lines." But these have the same meaning. Therefore love and dilection denote the same thing.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the movements of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> differ by reason of their objects. But the objects of dilection and love are the same. Therefore these are the same.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if dilection and love differ, it seems that it is chiefly in the fact that "dilection refers to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, love to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things, as some have maintained," according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei xiv, 7). But they do not differ thus; because as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 7) the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> uses both words in reference to either <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or bad things. Therefore love and dilection do not differ: thus indeed <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> concludes (De Civ. Dei xiv, 7) that "it is not one thing to speak of love, and another to speak of dilection."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that "some <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men have held that love means something more Godlike than dilection does."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We find four words referring in a way, to the same thing: viz. love, dilection, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and friendship. They differ, however, in this, that "friendship," according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. viii, 5), "is like a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>," whereas "love" and "dilection" are expressed by way of act or passion; and "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>" can be taken either way.

<p>Moreover these three express act in different ways. For love has a wider signification than the others, since every dilection or <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is love, but not vice versa. Because dilection implies, in addition to love, a choice [electionem] made beforehand, as the very word denotes: and therefore dilection is not in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> power, but only in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and only in the rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> denotes, in addition to love, a certain perfection of love, in so far as that which is loved is held to be of great price, as the word itself implies [Referring to the Latin "carus" (dear)].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> is speaking of love and dilection, in so far as they are in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; for thus love is the same as dilection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The object of love is more general than the object of dilection: because love extends to more than dilection does, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Love and dilection differ, not in respect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but as stated. Yet in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> faculty love is the same as dilection. And it is in this sense that <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> speaks of love in the passage quoted: hence a little further on he adds that "a right <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is well-directed love, and a wrong <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is ill-directed love." However, the fact that love, which is <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> passion, inclines many to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, is the reason why some assigned the difference spoken of.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The reason why some held that, even when applied to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> itself, the word "love" signifies something more Godlike than "dilection," was because love denotes a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, especially in so far as it is in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; whereas dilection presupposes the judgment of reason. But it is possible for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to tend to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by love, being as it were passively drawn by Him, more than he can possibly be drawn thereto by his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, which pertains to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of dilection, as stated above. And consequently love is more Godlike than dilection.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether love is properly divided into love of friendship and love of concupiscence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that love is not properly divided into love of friendship and love of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. For "love is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, while friendship is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>," according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. viii, 5). But <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> cannot be the member of a division of <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Therefore love is not properly divided into love of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> and love of friendship.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a thing cannot be divided by another member of the same division; for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not a member of the same division as "animal." But <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is a member of the same division as love, as a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> distinct from love. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is not a division of love.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. viii, 3) friendship is threefold, that which is founded on "usefulness," that which is founded on "pleasure," and that which is founded on "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>." But useful and pleasant friendship are not without <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> should not be contrasted with friendship.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> We are said to love certain things, because we desire them: thus "a man is said to love wine, on account of its sweetness which he desires"; as stated in Topic. ii, 3. But we have no friendship for wine and suchlike things, as stated in Ethic. viii, 2. Therefore love of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is distinct from love of friendship.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 4), "to love is to wish <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to someone." Hence the movement of love has a twofold tendency: towards the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which a man wishes to someone (to himself or to another) and towards that to which he wishes some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Accordingly, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has love of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> towards the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that he wishes to another, and love of friendship towards him to whom he wishes <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p>Now the members of this division are related as primary and secondary: since that which is loved with the love of friendship is loved simply and for itself; whereas that which is loved with the love of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, is loved, not simply and for itself, but for something else. For just as that which has <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, is a being simply, while that which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in another is a relative being; so, because <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is convertible with being, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which itself has <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> simply; but that which is another's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, is a relative <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Consequently the love with which a thing is loved, that it may have some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, is love simply; while the love, with which a thing is loved, that it may be another's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, is relative love.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Love is not divided into friendship and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, but into love of friendship, and love of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. For a friend is, properly speaking, one to whom we wish <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: while we are said to desire, what we wish for ourselves.

<p>Hence the Reply to the Second Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> When friendship is based on usefulness or pleasure, a man does indeed wish his friend some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: and in this respect the character of friendship is preserved. But since he refers this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> further to his own pleasure or use, the result is that friendship of the useful or pleasant, in so far as it is connected with love of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, loses the character to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> friendship.
