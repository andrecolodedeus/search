<h1>Question 26. Those who can grant indulgences</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5026.htm#article1"> Can every parish priest grant indulgences?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5026.htm#article2"> Can a deacon or another, who is not a priest, grant indulgences?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5026.htm#article3"> Can a bishop grant them?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5026.htm#article4"> Can they be granted by one who is in mortal sin?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether every parish priest can grant indulgences?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that every <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> can grant <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>. For an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> derives its efficacy from the superabundance of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>. Now there is no congregation without some superabundance of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>. Therefore every <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, who has charge of a congregation, can grant <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, and, in like manner, so can every prelate.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every prelate stands for a multitude, just as an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> stands for himself. But any <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> can assign his own goods to another and thus offer satisfaction for a third <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Therefore a prelate can assign the property of the multitude subject to him, and so it seems that he can grant <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> To <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> is less than to grant <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>. But a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> cannot do the former. Therefore he cannot do the latter.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Indulgences are effective, in as much as the works of satisfaction done by one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> are applied to another, not only by virtue of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, but also by the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who did them being directed in some way to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to whom they are applied. Now a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> may be directed to another in three ways, specifically, generically and individually. Individually, as when one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> offers satisfaction for another particular <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; and thus anyone can apply his works to another. Specifically, as when a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for the congregation to which he belongs, for the members of his household, or for his benefactors, and directs his works of satisfaction to the same <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>: in this way the superior of a congregation can apply those works to some other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, by applying the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of those who belong to his congregation to some fixed <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. Generically, as when a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> directs his works for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in general; and thus he who presides over the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> can communicate those works, by applying his <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> to this or that <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. And since a man is a member of a congregation, and a congregation is a part of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, hence the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of private <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> includes the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the congregation, and of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Therefore he who presides over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> can communicate what belongs to an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> congregation or to an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: and he who presides over a congregation can communicate what belongs to an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but not conversely. Yet neither the first nor the second communication is called an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>, but only the third; and this for two reasons. First, because, although those communications loose <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from the debt of punishment in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet he is not freed from the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of fulfilling the satisfaction enjoined, to which he is bound by a commandment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; whereas the third communication frees <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> even from this <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>. Secondly, because in one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> or even in one congregation there is not such an unfailing supply of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> as to be sufficient both for the one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> or congregation and for all others; and consequently the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> is not freed from the entire debt of punishment unless satisfaction is offered for him individually, to the very amount that he owes. On the other hand, in the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> there is an unfailing supply of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, chiefly on account of the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Consequently he alone who is at the head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> can grant <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>. Since, however, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is the congregation of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, and since a congregation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> is of two kinds, the domestic, composed of members of the same <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and the civil, composed of members of the same nationality, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is like to a civil congregation, for the people themselves are called the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; while the various assemblies, or parishes of one diocese are likened to a congregation in the various families and services. Hence a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> alone is properly called a prelate of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, wherefore he alone, like a bridegroom, receives the <a href="../cathen/13059a.htm">ring</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Consequently full power in the dispensation of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in the public tribunal, belong to him alone as the public <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, but to others by delegation from him. Those <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who have charge of the people are not <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> strictly speaking, but assistants, hence, in <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> says: "The more fragile we are, the more we need these assistants": and for this reason they do not dispense all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, or <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> or other like <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> cannot grant <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether a deacon or another who is not a priest can grant an indulgence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, or one that is not a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> cannot grant an indulgence. Because remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is an effect of the keys. Now none but a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> has the keys. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> alone can grant <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a fuller remission of punishment is granted by <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> than by the tribunal of Penance. But a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> alone has power in the latter, and, therefore, he alone has power in the former.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The distribution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> treasury is entrusted to the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> as the government of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Now this is entrusted sometimes to one who is not a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Therefore he can grant <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, since they derive their efficacy from the distribution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> treasury.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The power of granting <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> follows <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, as stated above (Question 25, Article 2). And since <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> and others, who are not <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, can have <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> either delegated, as legates, or ordinary, as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>-elect, it follows that even those who are not <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> can grant <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, although they cannot <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> in the tribunal of Penance, since this follows the reception of orders.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections, because the granting of <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> belongs to the key of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> and not to the key of orders.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether a bishop can grant indulgences?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that even a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> cannot grant indulgences. Because the treasury of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is the common property of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Now the common property of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> cannot be distributed save by him who presides over the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Therefore the Pope alone can grant <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, none can remit punishments fixed by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, save the one who has the power to make the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Now punishments in satisfaction for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are fixed by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Therefore the Pope alone can remit these punishments, since he is the maker of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> stands the custom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in accordance with which <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> grant <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The Pope has the plenitude of pontifical power, being like a king in his kingdom: whereas the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are appointed to a share in his solicitude, like judges over each city. Hence them alone the Pope, in his letters, addresses as "brethren," whereas he calls all others his "sons." Therefore the plenitude of the power of granting <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> resides in the Pope, because he can grant them, as he lists, provided the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> be a lawful one: while, in <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, this power resides subject to the Pope's ordination, so that they can grant them within fixed limits and not beyond.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether indulgences can be granted by one who is in mortal sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> cannot be granted by one who is in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For a stream can no longer flow if cut off from its source. Now the source of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is cut off from one who is in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore such a one can convey nothing to others by granting <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is a greater thing to grant an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> than to receive one. But one who is in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot receive an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>, as we shall show presently (27, 1). Neither, therefore, can he grant one.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Indulgences are granted in virtue of the power conferred on the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Now mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> takes away, not power but <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Therefore one who is in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can grant <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The granting of <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. But a man does not, through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, lose <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Consequently <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> are equally valid, whether they be granted by one who is in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or by a most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; since he remits punishment, not by virtue of his own <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, but by virtue of the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> laid up in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> treasury.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The prelate who, while in a state of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, grants an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>, does not pour forth anything of his own, and so it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that he should receive an inflow from the source, in order that he may grant a valid <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Further, to grant an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> is more than to receive one, if we consider the power, but it is less, if we consider the personal profit.
