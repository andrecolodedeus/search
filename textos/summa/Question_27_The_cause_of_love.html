<h1>Question 27. The cause of love</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2027.htm#article1"> Is good the only cause of love?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2027.htm#article2"> Is knowledge a cause of love?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2027.htm#article3"> Is likeness a cause of love?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2027.htm#article4"> Is any other passion of the soul a cause of love?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether good is the only cause of love?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is not the only <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of love. For <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> love, except because it is loved. But it happens that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> also is loved, according to <a href="../bible/psa010.htm#verse6">Psalm 10:6</a>: "He that loveth <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, hateth his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>": else, every love would be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is not the only <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of love.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 4) that "we love those who acknowledge their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>." Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of love.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that not "the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" only but also "the beautiful is beloved by all."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. viii, 3): "Assuredly the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> alone is beloved." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> alone is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of love.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 26, Article 1), Love belongs to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power which is a passive faculty. Wherefore its object stands in relation to it as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of its movement or act. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of love must needs be love's object. Now the proper object of love is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; because, as stated above (26, 1,2), love implies a certain connaturalness or complacency of the lover for the thing beloved, and to everything, that thing is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is akin and proportionate to it. It follows, therefore, that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is the proper <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of love.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">Evil</a> is never loved except under the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, that is to say, in so far as it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in some respect, and is considered as being <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> simply. And thus a certain love is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, in so far as it tends to that which is not simply a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. It is in this way that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> "loves <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>," inasmuch as, by means of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is gained; pleasure, for instance, or money, or such like.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Those who acknowledge their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, are beloved, not for their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, but because they acknowledge them, for it is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thing to acknowledge one's faults, in so far as it excludes insincerity or hypocrisy.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The beautiful is the same as the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and they differ in aspect only. For since <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is what all seek, the notion of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is that which calms the desire; while the notion of the beautiful is that which calms the desire, by being seen or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Consequently those senses chiefly regard the beautiful, which are the most cognitive, viz. sight and hearing, as ministering to reason; for we speak of beautiful sights and beautiful sounds. But in reference to the other objects of the other senses, we do not use the expression "beautiful," for we do not speak of beautiful tastes, and beautiful odors. Thus it is evident that beauty adds to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> a relation to the cognitive faculty: so that "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" means that which simply pleases the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; while the "beautiful" is something pleasant to apprehend.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether knowledge is a cause of love?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of love. For it is due to love that a thing is sought. But some things are sought without being <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, for instance, the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>; for since "to have them is the same as to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Q83, qu. 35), if we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> them we should have them, and should not seek them. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of love.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to love what we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not seems like <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> something more than we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it. But some things are loved more than they are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>: thus in this life <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can be loved in Himself, but cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in Himself. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of love.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> were the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of love, there would be no love, where there is no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. But in all things there is love, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv); whereas there is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in all things. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of love.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> proves (De Trin. x, 1,2) that "none can love what he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of love, as being its object. But <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is not the object of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, except as apprehended. And therefore love demands some apprehension of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that is loved. For this reason the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. ix, 5,12) says that bodily sight is the beginning of sensitive love: and in like manner the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> beauty or <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is the beginning of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> love. Accordingly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of love for the same reason as <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is, which can be loved only if <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> He who seeks science, is not entirely without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> thereof: but <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> something about it already in some respect, either in a general way, or in some one of its effects, or from having heard it commended, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. x, 1,2). But to have it is not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it thus, but to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it perfectly.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Something is required for the perfection of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, that is not requisite for the perfection of love. For <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> belongs to the reason, whose function it is to distinguish things which in reality are united, and to unite together, after a fashion, things that are distinct, by comparing one with another. Consequently the perfection of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> requires that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> distinctly all that is in a thing, such as its parts, powers, and properties. On the other hand, love is in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, which regards a thing as it is in itself: wherefore it suffices, for the perfection of love, that a thing be loved according as it is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in itself. Hence it is, therefore, that a thing is loved more than it is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; since it can be loved perfectly, even without being perfectly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. This is most evident in regard to the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, which some love through having a certain general <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of them: for instance, they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that rhetoric is a science that enables <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to persuade others; and this is what they love in rhetoric. The same applies to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Even <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love, which is in all things, is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by a kind of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, not indeed <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things themselves, but in Him Who <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as stated above (26, 1; cf. I, 6, 1, ad 2).

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether likeness is a cause of love?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that likeness is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of love. For the same thing is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of contraries. But likeness is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>; for it is written (<a href="../bible/pro013.htm#verse10">Proverbs 13:10</a>) that "among the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> there are always contentions"; and the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. viii, 1) that "potters quarrel with one another." Therefore likeness is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of love.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. iv, 14) that "a man loves in another that which he would not be himself: thus he loves an actor, but would not himself be an actor." But it would not be so, if likeness were the proper <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of love; for in that case a man would love in another, that which he possesses himself, or would like to possess. Therefore likeness is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of love.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, everyone loves that which he needs, even if he have it not: thus a sick <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> loves health, and a poor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> loves <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>. But in so far as he needs them and lacks them, he is unlike them. Therefore not only likeness but also unlikeness is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of love.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 4) that "we love those who bestow money and health on us; and also those who retain their friendship for the dead." But all are not such. Therefore likeness is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of love.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/sir013.htm#verse19">Sirach 13:19</a>): "Every beast loveth its like."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Likeness, properly speaking, is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of love. But it must be observed that likeness between things is twofold. One kind of likeness arises from each thing having the same <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> actually: for example, two things possessing the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of whiteness are said to be alike. Another kind of likeness arises from one thing having <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a> and by way of inclination, a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> which the other has actually: thus we may say that a heavy body <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> outside its proper place is like another heavy body that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in its proper place: or again, according as <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> bears a resemblance to its act; since act is contained, in a manner, in the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> itself.

<p>Accordingly the first kind of likeness <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> love of friendship or well-being. For the very fact that two men are alike, having, as it were, one form, makes them to be, in a manner, one in that form: thus two men are one thing in the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of humanity, and two white men are one thing in whiteness. Hence the affections of one tend to the other, as being one with him; and he wishes <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to him as to himself. But the second kind of likeness <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> love of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, or friendship founded on usefulness or pleasure: because whatever is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, as such, has the desire for its act; and it takes pleasure in its realization, if it be a sentient and cognitive being.

<p>Now it has been stated above (Question 26, Article 4), that in the love of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, the lover, properly speaking, loves himself, in willing the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that he desires. But a man loves himself more than another: because he is one with himself substantially, whereas with another he is one only in the likeness of some form. Consequently, if this other's likeness to him arising from the participation of a form, hinders him from gaining the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that he loves, he becomes hateful to him, not for being like him, but for hindering him from gaining his own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. This is why "potters quarrel among themselves," because they hinder one another's gain: and why "there are contentions among the proud," because they hinder one another in attaining the position they covet.

<p>Hence the Reply to the First Objection is evident.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Even when a man loves in another what he loves not in himself, there is a certain likeness of proportion: because as the latter is to that which is loved in him, so is the former to that which he loves in himself: for instance, if a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> singer love a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> writer, we can see a likeness of proportion, inasmuch as each one has that which is becoming to him in respect of his art.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> He that loves what he needs, bears a likeness to what he loves, as <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> bears a likeness to its act, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> According to the same likeness of <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to its act, the illiberal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> loves the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who is liberal, in so far as he expects from him something which he desires. The same applies to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who is constant in his friendship as compared to one who is inconstant. For in either case friendship seems to be based on usefulness. We might also say that although not all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> have these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in the complete <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, yet they have them according to certain seminal principles in the reason, in force of which principles the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who is not <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> loves the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as being in conformity with his own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether any other passion of the soul is a cause of love?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that some other passion can be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of love. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. viii, 3) says that some are loved for the sake of the pleasure they give. But pleasure is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>. Therefore another passion is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of love.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, desire is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>. But we love some because we desire to receive something from them: as happens in every friendship based on usefulness. Therefore another passion is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of love.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. x, 1): "When we have no hope of getting a thing, we love it but half-heartedly or not at all, even if we see how beautiful it is." Therefore hope too is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of love.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> All the other emotions of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by love, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 7,9).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There is no other passion of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that does not presuppose love of some kind. The reason is that every other passion of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> implies either movement towards something, or rest in something. Now every movement towards something, or rest in something, arises from some kinship or aptness to that thing; and in this does love consist. Therefore it is not possible for any other passion of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be universally the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of every love. But it may happen that some other passion is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of some particular love: just as one <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> When a man loves a thing for the pleasure it affords, his love is indeed <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by pleasure; but that very pleasure is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a>, in its turn, by another preceding love; for none takes pleasure save in that which is loved in some way.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Desire for a thing always presupposes love for that thing. But desire of one thing can be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of another thing's being loved; thus he that desires money, for this reason loves him from whom he receives it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Hope <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> or increases love; both by reason of pleasure, because it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> pleasure; and by reason of desire, because hope strengthens desire, since we do not desire so intensely that which we have no hope of receiving. Nevertheless hope itself is of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that is loved.
