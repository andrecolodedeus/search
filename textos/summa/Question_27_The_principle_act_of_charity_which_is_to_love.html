<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether to be loved is more proper to charity than to love?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is more proper to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> to be loved than to love. For the better <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is to be found in those who are themselves better. But those who are better should be more loved. Therefore to be loved is more proper to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which is to be found in more subjects seems to be more in keeping with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and, for that reason, better. Now, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. viii, 8), "many would rather be loved than love, and lovers of flattery always abound." Therefore it is better to be loved than to love, and consequently it is more in keeping with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of anything being such is yet more so." Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> love because they are loved, for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Catech. Rud. iv) that "nothing incites another more to love you than that you love him first." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> consists in being loved rather than in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. viii, 8) that friendship consists in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> rather than in being loved. Now <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is a kind of friendship. Therefore it consists in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> rather than in being loved.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> To love belongs to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> as <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For, since <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, by its very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> it has an inclination to its proper act. Now to be loved is not the act of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> loved; for this act is to love: and to be loved is competent to him as coming under the common notion of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, in so far as another tends towards his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Hence it is clear that to love is more proper to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> than to be loved: for that which befits a thing by reason of itself and its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is more competent to it than that which is befitting to it by reason of something else. This can be exemplified in two ways. First, in the fact that friends are more commended for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> than for being loved, indeed, if they be loved and yet love not, they are blamed. Secondly, because a mother, whose love is the greatest, seeks rather to love than to be loved: for "some <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> observes (Ethic. viii, 8) "entrust their children to a nurse; they do love them indeed, yet seek not to be loved in return, if they happen not to be loved."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A better <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, through being better, is more lovable; but through having more perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, loves more. He loves more, however, in proportion to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> he loves. For a better <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not love that which is beneath him less than it ought to be loved: whereas he who is less <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> fails to love one who is better, as much as he ought to be loved.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. viii, 8), "men wish to be loved in as much as they wish to be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>." For just as <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is bestowed on a man in order to bear witness to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is in him, so by being loved a man is shown to have some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> alone is lovable. Accordingly men seek to be loved and to be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>, for the sake of something else, viz. to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> loved. On the other hand, those who have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> seek to love for the sake of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a>, as though this were itself the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, even as the act of any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Hence it is more proper to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> to wish to love than to wish to be loved.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Some love on account of being loved, not so that to be loved is the end of their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a>, but because it is a kind of way leading a man to love.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether to love considered as an act of charity is the same as goodwill?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that to love, considered as an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, is nothing else than goodwill. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 4) that "to love is to wish a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> well"; and this is goodwill. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is nothing but goodwill.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the act belongs to the same subject as the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is in the power of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as stated above (Question 24, Article 1). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is also an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. But it tends to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> only, and this is goodwill. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is nothing else than goodwill.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> reckons five things pertaining to friendship (Ethic. ix, 4), the first of which is that a man should wish his friend well; the second, that he should wish him to be and to live; the third, that he should take pleasure in his company; the fourth, that he should make choice of the same things; the fifth, that he should grieve and rejoice with him. Now the first two pertain to goodwill. Therefore goodwill is the first <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ix, 5) that "goodwill is neither friendship nor love, but the beginning of friendship." Now <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is friendship, as stated above (Question 23, Article 1). Therefore goodwill is not the same as to love considered as an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Goodwill properly speaking is that act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> whereby we wish well to another. Now this act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> differs from actual love, considered not only as being in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> but also as being in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> or will. For the love which is in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>. Now every <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> seeks its object with a certain eagerness. And the passion of love is not aroused suddenly, but is born of an earnest consideration of the object loved; wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a>, showing the difference between goodwill and the love which is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, says (Ethic. ix, 5) that goodwill does not imply impetuosity or desire, that is to say, has not an eager inclination, because it is by the sole judgment of his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> that one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> wishes another well. Again such like love arises from previous acquaintance, whereas goodwill sometimes arises suddenly, as happens to us if we look on at a boxing-match, and we wish one of the boxers to win.

<p>But the love, which is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, also differs from goodwill, because it denotes a certain union of affections between the lover and the beloved, in as much as the lover deems the beloved as somewhat united to him, or belonging to him, and so tends towards him. On the other hand, goodwill is a simple act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, whereby we wish a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> well, even without presupposing the aforesaid union of the affections with him. Accordingly, to love, considered as an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, includes goodwill, but such dilection or love adds union of affections, wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ix, 5) that "goodwill is a beginning of friendship."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a>, by thus defining "to love," does not describe it fully, but mentions only that part of its definition in which the act of love is chiefly manifested.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> To love is indeed an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> tending to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but it adds a certain union with the beloved, which union is not denoted by goodwill.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> These things mentioned by the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> belong to friendship because they arise from a man's love for himself, as he says in the same passage, in so far as a man does all these things in respect of his friend, even as he does them to himself: and this belongs to the aforesaid union of the affections.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether out of charity God ought to be loved for Himself?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is loved out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, not for Himself but for the sake of something else. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says in a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> (In Evang. xi): "The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> learns from the things it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, to love those it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not," where by things unknown he means the intelligible and the Divine, and by things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> he indicates the objects of the senses. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is to be loved for the sake of something else.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, love follows <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through something else, according to <a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse20">Romans 1:20</a>: "The invisible things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made." Therefore He is also loved on account of something else and not for Himself.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "hope begets <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>" as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says on <a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse1">Matthew 1:1</a>, and "fear leads to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>," according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> in his commentary on the First Canonical Epistle of John (In prim. canon. Joan. Tract. ix). Now hope looks forward to obtain something from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while fear shuns something which can be inflicted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is to be loved on account of some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> we hope for, or some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to be feared. Therefore He is not to be loved for Himself.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Doctr. Christ. i), to enjoy is to cleave to something for its own sake. Now "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is to be enjoyed" as he says in the same book. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is to be loved for Himself.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The preposition "for" denotes a relation of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>. Now there are four kinds of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, viz., final, formal, efficient, and material, to which a material disposition also is to be reduced, though it is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> simply but relatively. According to these four different <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> one thing is said to be loved for another. On respect of the final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, we love medicine, for instance, for health; in respect of the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">formal</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, we love a man for his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, because, to wit, by his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> he is formally <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and therefore lovable; in respect of the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, we love certain men because, for instance, they are the sons of such and such a father; and in respect of the disposition which is reducible to the genus of a material <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, we speak of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> something for that which disposed us to love it, e.g. we love a man for the favors received from him, although after we have begun to love our friend, we no longer love him for his favors, but for his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Accordingly, as regards the first three ways, we love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not for anything else, but for Himself. For He is not directed to anything else as to an end, but is Himself the last end of all things; nor does He require to receive any form in order to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, for His very <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, which is itself the exemplar of all other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things; nor again does <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> accrue to Him from aught else, but from Him to all other things. On the fourth way, however, He can be loved for something else, because we are disposed by certain things to advance in His love, for instance, by favors bestowed by Him, by the rewards we hope to receive from Him, or even by the punishments which we are minded to avoid through Him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> From the things it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> learns to love what it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not, not as though the things it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> were the reason for its <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> things it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not, through being the formal, final, or efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of this love, but because this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> disposes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to love the unknown.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is indeed acquired through other things, but after He is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, He is no longer <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through them, but through Himself, according to <a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse42">John 4:42</a>: "We now <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, not for thy saying: for we ourselves have heard Him, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this is indeed the Saviour of the world."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Hope and fear lead to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> by way of a certain disposition, as was shown above (17, 8; 19, 4,7,10).

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether God can be loved immediately in this life?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be loved immediately in this life. For the "unknown cannot be loved" as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. x, 1). Now we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> immediately in this life, since "we see now through a glass, in a dark manner" (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>). Neither, therefore, do we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him immediately.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, he who cannot do what is less, cannot do what is more. Now it is more to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him, since "he who is joined" to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by love, is "one spirit with Him" (<a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse17">1 Corinthians 6:17</a>). But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> immediately. Therefore much less can he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him immediately.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is severed from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/isa059.htm#verse2">Isaiah 59:2</a>: "Your iniquities have divided between you and your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> rather than in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is less able to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> immediately than to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him immediately.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, through being mediate, is said to be "enigmatic," and "falls away" in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, as stated in <a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>. But <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> "does not fall away" as stated in the same passage (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of the way adheres to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> immediately.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (I, 82, 3; 84, 7), the act of a cognitive power is completed by the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> being in the knower, whereas the act of an <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power consists in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> being inclined towards the thing in itself. Hence it follows that the movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power is towards things in respect of their own <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, whereas the act of a cognitive power follows the mode of the knower.

<p>Now in itself the very order of things is such, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is knowable and lovable for Himself, since He is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> itself, whereby other things are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and loved: but with regard to us, since our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is derived through the senses, those things are knowable first which are nearer to our senses, and the last term of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is that which is most remote from our senses.

<p>Accordingly, we must assert that to love which is an act of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, even in this state of life, tends to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> first, and flows on from Him to other things, and in this sense <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> immediately, and other things through <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. On the other hand, with regard to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, it is the reverse, since we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through other things, either as a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> through its effects, or by way of pre-eminence or negation as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> states (Div. Nom. i; cf. I, 12, 12).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although the unknown cannot be loved, it does not follow that the order of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is the same as the order of love, since love is the term of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and consequently, love can begin at once where <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> ends, namely in the thing itself which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through another thing.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Since to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is something greater than to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him, especially in this state of life, it follows that love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> presupposes <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And because this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> does not rest in creatures, but, through them, tends to something else, love begins there, and thence goes on to other things by a circular movement so to speak; for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> begins from creatures, tends to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and love begins with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the last end, and passes on to creatures.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Aversion from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is brought about by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is removed by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, but not by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> alone: hence <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, unites the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> immediately to Him with a chain of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> union.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether God can be loved wholly? [Cf. 184, 2]</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be loved wholly. For love follows <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be wholly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by us, since this would imply comprehension of Him. Therefore He cannot be wholly loved by us.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, love is a kind of union, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> shows (Div. Nom. iv). But the heart of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot be wholly united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is greater than our heart" (<a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse20">1 John 3:20</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be loved wholly.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> loves Himself wholly. If therefore He be loved wholly by another, this one will <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him as much as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> loves Himself.

<p>But this is unreasonable. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be wholly loved by a creature.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse5">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>): "Thou shalt love the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> with thy whole heart."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since love may be considered as something between lover and beloved, when we ask whether <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can be wholly loved, the question may be understood in three ways, first so that the qualification "wholly" be referred to the thing loved, and thus <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is to be loved wholly, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should love all that pertains to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>Secondly, it may be understood as though "wholly" qualified the lover: and thus again <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> ought to be loved wholly, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ought to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with all his might, and to refer all he has to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse5">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>: "Thou shalt love the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> with thy whole heart."

<p>Thirdly, it may be understood by way of comparison of the lover to the thing loved, so that the mode of the lover equal the mode of the thing loved. This is impossible: for, since a thing is lovable in proportion to its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> lovable, since His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. Now no creature can love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a>, because all power of creatures, whether it be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> or infused, is finite.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections, because the first three objections consider the question in this third sense, while the last takes it in the second sense.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether in loving God we ought to observe any mode?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that we ought to observe some mode in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the notion of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> consists in mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Nat. Boni iii, iv). Now the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the best thing in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, according to <a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse14">Colossians 3:14</a>: "Above all . . . things, have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>." Therefore there ought to be a mode of the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Morib. Eccl. viii): "Prithee, tell me which is the mode of love. For I fear lest I burn with the desire and love of my Lord, more or less than I ought." But it would be useless to seek the mode of the Divine love, unless there were one. Therefore there is a mode of the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. iv, 3), "the measure which <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> appoints to a thing, is its mode." Now the measure of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will, as also of external action, is the reason. Therefore just as it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the reason to appoint a mode to the exterior effect of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse1">Romans 12:1</a>: "Your reasonable service," so also the interior love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> requires a mode.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">Bernard</a> says (De Dilig. Deum 1) that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the measure is to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him without measure."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As appears from the words of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> quoted above (Objection 3) mode signifies a determination of measure; which determination is to be found both in the measure and in the thing measured, but not in the same way. For it is found in the measure <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, because a measure is of itself the determining and modifying rule of other things; whereas in the things measured, it is found relatively, that is in so far as they attain to the measure. Hence there can be nothing unmodified in the measure whereas the thing measured is unmodified if it fails to attain to the measure, whether by deficiency or by excess.

<p>Now in all matters of <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> and action the measure is the end, because the proper reason for all that we desire or do should be taken from the end, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proves (Phys. ii, 9). Therefore the end has a mode by itself, while the means take their mode from being proportionate to the end. Hence, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Polit. i, 3), "in every art, the desire for the end is endless and unlimited," whereas there is a limit to the means: thus the physician does not put limits to health, but makes it as perfect as he possibly can; but he puts a limit to medicine, for he does not give as much medicine as he can, but according as health demands so that if he give too much or too little, the medicine would be immoderate.

<p>Again, the end of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions and affections is the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whereby principally we attain to our last end, as stated above (Question 23, Article 6), wherefore the mode in the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, must not be taken as in a thing measured where we find too much or too little, but as in the measure itself, where there cannot be excess, and where the more the rule is attained the better it is, so that the more we love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the better our love is.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> That which is so by its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> takes precedence of that which is so through another, wherefore the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the measure which has the mode <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, takes precedence of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the thing measured, which has its mode through something else; and so too, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which has a mode as a measure has, stands before the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, which have a mode through being measured.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> adds in the same passage, "the measure of our love for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him with our whole heart," that is to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him as much as He can be loved, and this belongs to the mode which is proper to the measure.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> An affection, whose object is subject to reason's judgment, should be measured by reason. But the object of the Divine love which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> surpasses the judgment of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, wherefore it is not measured by reason but transcends it. Nor is there parity between the interior act and external acts of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For the interior <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> has the character of an end, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> ultimate <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> consists in his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cleaving to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa072.htm#verse28">Psalm 72:28</a>: "It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for me to adhere to my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>"; whereas the exterior acts are as means to the end, and so have to be measured both according to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and according to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether it is more meritorious to love an enemy than to love a friend?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem more <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> to love an enemy than to love a friend. For it is written (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse46">Matthew 5:46</a>): "If you love them that love you, what reward shall you have?" Therefore it is not deserving of reward to love one's friend: whereas, as the same passage proves, to love one's enemy is deserving of a reward. Therefore it is more <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> to love one's enemy than to love one's friend.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, an act is the more <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> through proceeding from a greater <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. But it belongs to the perfect children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to love their enemies, whereas those also who have imperfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> love their friends. Therefore it is more <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> to love one's enemy than to love one's friend.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, where there is more effort for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, there seems to be more <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, since "every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall receive his own reward according to his own labor" (<a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse8">1 Corinthians 3:8</a>). Now a man has to make a greater effort to love his enemy than to love his friend, because it is more difficult. Therefore it seems more <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> to love one's enemy than to love one's friend.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The better an action is, the more <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> it is. Now it is better to love one's friend, since it is better to love a better <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and the friend who loves you is better than the enemy who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> you. Therefore it is more <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> to love one's friend than to love one's enemy.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the reason for our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> our neighbor out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as stated above (Question 25, Article 1). When therefore it is asked which is better or more <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>, to love one's friend or one's enemy, these two loves may be compared in two ways, first, on the part of our neighbor whom we love, secondly, on the part of the reason for which we love him.

<p>In the first way, love of one's friend surpasses love of one's enemy, because a friend is both better and more closely united to us, so that he is a more suitable <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of love and consequently the act of love that passes over this matter, is better, and therefore its opposite is worse, for it is worse to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> a friend than an enemy.

<p>In the second way, however, it is better to love one's enemy than one's friend, and this for two reasons. First, because it is possible to love one's friend for another reason than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whereas <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the only reason for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> one's enemy. Secondly, because if we suppose that both are loved for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, our love for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be all the stronger through carrying a man's affections to things which are furthest from him, namely, to the love of his enemies, even as the power of a furnace is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be the stronger, according as it throws its heat to more distant objects. Hence our love for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be so much the stronger, as the more difficult are the things we accomplish for its sake, just as the power of fire is so much the stronger, as it is able to set fire to a less inflammable <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p>Yet just as the same fire acts with greater force on what is near than on what is distant, so too, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> loves with greater fervor those who are united to us than those who are far removed; and in this respect the love of friends, considered in itself, is more ardent and better than the love of one's enemy.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> must be taken in their strict sense: because the love of one's friends is not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sight when we love them merely because they are our friends: and this would seem to be the case when we love our friends in such a way that we love not our enemies. On the other hand the love of our friends is <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>, if we love them for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake, and not merely because they are our friends.

<p>The Reply to the other Objections is evident from what has been said in the article, because the two arguments that follow consider the reason for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a>, while the last considers the question on the part of those who are loved.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether it is more meritorious to love one's neighbor than to love God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is more <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> to love one's neighbor than to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the more <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> thing would seem to be what the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> preferred. Now the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> preferred the love of our neighbor to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse3">Romans 9:3</a>: "I wished myself to be an <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> for my brethren." Therefore it is more <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> to love one's neighbor than to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in a certain sense it seems to be less <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> to love one's friend, as stated above (<a href="#7">Article 7</a>). Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is our chief friend, since "He hath first loved us" (<a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse10">1 John 4:10</a>). Therefore it seems less <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whatever is more difficult seems to be more <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> and <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> since "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is about that which is difficult and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" (Ethic. ii, 3). Now it is easier to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than to love one's neighbor, both because all things love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, and because there is nothing unlovable in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and this cannot be said of one's neighbor. Therefore it is more <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> to love one's neighbor than to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> That on account of which a thing is such, is yet more so. Now the love of one's neighbor is not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>, except by reason of his being loved for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake. Therefore the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is more <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> than the love of our neighbor.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> This comparison may be taken in two ways. First, by considering both loves separately: and then, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the more <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>, because a reward is due to it for its own sake, since the ultimate reward is the enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to Whom the movement of the Divine love tends: hence a reward is promised to him that loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse21">John 14:21</a>): "He that loveth Me, shall be loved of My Father, and I will . . . manifest Myself to him." Secondly, the comparison may be understood to be between the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone on the one side, and the love of one's neighbor for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake, on the other. On this way love of our neighbor includes love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not include love of our neighbor. Hence the comparison will be between perfect love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, extending also to our neighbor, and inadequate and imperfect love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for "this commandment we have from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that he, who loveth <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, love also his brother" (<a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse21">1 John 4:21</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> According to one <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> did not desire this, viz. to be severed from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> for his brethren, when he was in a state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a>, but had formerly desired it when he was in a state of unbelief, so that we should not imitate him in this respect.

<p>We may also reply, with <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> (De Compunct. i, 8) [Hom. xvi in Ep. ad Rom.] that this does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> to have loved his neighbor more than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but that he loved <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more than himself. For he wished to be deprived for a time of the Divine fruition which pertains to love of one self, in order that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> might be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> in his neighbor, which pertains to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> love for his friends is sometimes less <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> in so far as he loves them for their sake, so as to fall short of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> reason for the friendship of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be loved for His own sake does not diminish the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, but is the entire reason for <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" has, more than the "difficult," to do with the reason of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore it does not follow that whatever is more difficult is more <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>, but only what is more difficult, and at the same time better.
