<h1>Question 27. The procession of the divine persons</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1027.htm#article1"> Is there procession in God?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1027.htm#article2"> Can any procession in God be called generation?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1027.htm#article3"> Can there be any other procession in God besides generation?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1027.htm#article4"> Can that other procession be called generation?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1027.htm#article5"> Are there more than two processions in God?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether there is procession in God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there cannot be any procession in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For procession signifies outward movement. But in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is nothing mobile, nor anything extraneous. Therefore neither is there procession in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, everything which proceeds differs from that whence it proceeds. But in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is no diversity; but supreme simplicity. Therefore in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is no procession.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to proceed from another seems to be against the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the first principle. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the first principle, as shown above (Question 2, Article 3). Therefore in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is no procession.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> says, "From <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> I proceeded" (<a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse42">John 8:42</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Divine Scripture</a> uses, in relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, names which signify procession. This procession has been differently understood. Some have understood it in the sense of an effect, proceeding from its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; so <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> took it, saying that the Son proceeds from the Father as His primary creature, and that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> proceeds from the Father and the Son as the creature of both. In this sense neither the Son nor the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> would be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and this is contrary to what is said of the Son, "That . . . we may be in His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Son. This is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/1jo005.htm#verse20">1 John 5:20</a>). Of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> it is also said, "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Know</a> you not that your members are the temple of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>?" (<a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse19">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>). Now, to have a temple is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> prerogative. Others take this procession to mean the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> proceeding to the effect, as moving it, or impressing its own likeness on it; in which sense it was understood by Sabellius, who said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father is called Son in assuming flesh from the Virgin, and that the Father also is called <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> in sanctifying the rational creature, and moving it to life. The words of the Lord contradict such a meaning, when He speaks of Himself, "The Son cannot of Himself do anything" (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse19">John 5:19</a>); while many other passages show the same, whereby we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the Father is not the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. Careful examination shows that both of these opinions take procession as meaning an outward act; hence neither of them affirms procession as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself; whereas, since procession always supposes action, and as there is an outward procession corresponding to the act tending to external <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, so there must be an inward procession corresponding to the act remaining within the agent. This applies most conspicuously to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, the action of which remains in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> agent. For whenever we understand, by the very fact of understanding there proceeds something within us, which is a conception of the object understood, a conception issuing from our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> power and proceeding from our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of that object. This conception is signified by the spoken word; and it is called the word of the heart signified by the word of the voice.

<p>As <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is above all things, we should understand what is said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not according to the mode of the lowest creatures, namely bodies, but from the similitude of the highest creatures, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>; while even the similitudes derived from these fall short in the representation of divine objects. Procession, therefore, is not to be understood from what it is in bodies, either according to local movement or by way of a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> proceeding forth to its exterior effect, as, for instance, like heat from the agent to the thing made hot. Rather it is to be understood by way of an intelligible emanation, for example, of the intelligible word which proceeds from the speaker, yet remains in him. In that sense the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> understands procession as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This objection comes from the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of procession in the sense of local motion, or of an action tending to external <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, or to an exterior effect; which kind of procession does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as we have explained.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Whatever proceeds by way of outward procession is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> distinct from the source whence it proceeds, whereas, whatever proceeds within by an intelligible procession is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> distinct; indeed, the more perfectly it proceeds, the more closely it is one with the source whence it proceeds. For it is clear that the more a thing is understood, the more closely is the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> conception joined and united to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> agent; since the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> by the very act of understanding is made one with the object understood. Thus, as the divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> is the very supreme perfection of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (14, 2), the divine Word is of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> perfectly one with the source whence He proceeds, without any kind of diversity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> To proceed from a principle, so as to be something outside and distinct from that principle, is irreconcilable with the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a first principle; whereas an intimate and uniform procession by way of an intelligible act is included in the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a first principle. For when we call the builder the principle of the house, in the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of such a principle is included that of his art; and it would be included in the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the first principle were the builder the first principle of the house. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is the first principle of all things, may be compared to things <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> as the architect is to things designed.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether any procession in God can be called generation?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that no procession in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can be called generation. For generation is change from non-existence to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and is opposed to corruption; while <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is the subject of both. Nothing of all this belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore generation cannot <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, procession <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to an intelligible mode, as above explained (1). But such a process is not called generation in us; therefore neither is it to be so called in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, anything that is generated derives <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> from its generator. Therefore such <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is a derived <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. But no derived <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> can be a self-subsistence. Therefore, since the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is self-subsisting (3, 4), it follows that no generated <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> can be the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. Therefore there is no generation in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/psa002.htm#verse7">Psalm 2:7</a>): "This day have I begotten Thee."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The procession of the Word in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is called generation. In <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> whereof we must observe that generation has a twofold meaning: one common to everything subject to generation and corruption; in which sense generation is nothing but change from non-existence to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. In another sense it is proper and belongs to living things; in which sense it signifies the origin of a living being from a conjoined living principle; and this is properly called birth. Not everything of that kind, however, is called begotten; but, strictly speaking, only what proceeds by way of similitude. Hence a hair has not the aspect of generation and sonship, but only that has which proceeds by way of a similitude. Nor will any likeness suffice; for a worm which is generated from animals has not the aspect of generation and sonship, although it has a generic similitude; for this kind of generation requires that there should be a procession by way of similitude in the same specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; as a man proceeds from a man, and a horse from a horse. So in living things, which proceed from <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a> to actual life, such as men and animals, generation includes both these kinds of generation. But if there is a being whose life does not proceed from <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to act, procession (if found in such a being) excludes entirely the first kind of generation; whereas it may have that kind of generation which belongs to living things. So in this manner the procession of the Word in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is generation; for He proceeds by way of intelligible action, which is a vital operation:--from a conjoined principle (as above described):--by way of similitude, inasmuch as the concept of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is a likeness of the object conceived:--and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, because in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the act of understanding and His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> are the same, as shown above (Question 14, Article 4). Hence the procession of the Word in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is called generation; and the Word Himself proceeding is called the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This objection is based on the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of generation in the first sense, importing the issuing forth from <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to act; in which sense it is not found in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The act of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> understanding in ourselves is not the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> itself of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; hence the word which proceeds within us by intelligible operation is not of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as the source whence it proceeds; so the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of generation cannot be properly and fully applied to it. But the divine act of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> is the very <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> itself of the one who understands (14, 4). The Word proceeding therefore proceeds as subsisting in the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and so is properly called begotten, and Son. Hence <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> employs terms which denote generation of living things in order to signify the procession of the divine Wisdom, namely, conception and birth; as is declared in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the divine Wisdom, "The depths were not as yet, and I was already conceived; before the hills, I was brought forth." (<a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse24">Proverbs 8:24</a>). In our way of understanding we use the word "conception" in order to signify that in the word of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is found the likeness of the thing understood, although there be no identity of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Not everything derived from another has <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in another subject; otherwise we could not say that the whole <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> being comes from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since there is no subject that could receive the whole <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. So, then, what is generated in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> receives its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> from the generator, not as though that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> were received into <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> or into a subject (which would conflict with the divine self-subsistence); but when we speak of His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> as received, we mean that He Who proceeds receives divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> from another; not, however, as if He were other from the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For in the perfection itself of the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> are contained both the Word intelligibly proceeding and the principle of the Word, with whatever belongs to His perfection (4, 2).

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether any other procession exists in God besides that of the Word?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that no other procession <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> besides the generation of the Word. Because, for whatever reason we admit another procession, we should be led to admit yet another, and so on to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitude</a>; which cannot be. Therefore we must stop at the first, and hold that there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> only one procession in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> possesses but one mode of self-communication; because operations derive unity and diversity from their terms. But procession in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is only by way of communication of the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore, as there is only one divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> (11, 4), it follows that only one procession <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if any other procession but the intelligible procession of the Word <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it could only be the procession of love, which is by the operation of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. But such a procession is identified with the intelligible procession of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the same as His <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> (19, 1). Therefore in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is no other procession but the procession of the Word.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> proceeds from the Father (<a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse26">John 15:26</a>); and He is distinct from the Son, according to the words, "I will ask My Father, and He will give you another Paraclete" (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse16">John 14:16</a>). Therefore in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> another procession <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> besides the procession of the Word.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There are two processions in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the procession of the Word, and another. In evidence whereof we must observe that procession <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, only according to an action which does not tend to anything external, but remains in the agent itself. Such an action in an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is that of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. The procession of the Word is by way of an intelligible operation. The operation of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> within ourselves involves also another procession, that of love, whereby the object loved is in the lover; as, by the conception of the word, the object spoken of or understood is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> agent. Hence, besides the procession of the Word in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in Him another procession called the procession of love.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> There is no need to go on to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitude</a> in the divine processions; for the procession which is accomplished within the agent in an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> terminates in the procession of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> All that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (3, 3, 4); whereas the same does not apply to others. Therefore the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is communicated by every procession which is not outward, and this does not apply to other <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Though will and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> are not diverse in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of will and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> requires the processions belonging to each of them to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in a certain order. For the procession of love occurs in due order as regards the procession of the Word; since nothing can be loved by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> unless it is conceived in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. So as there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> a certain order of the Word to the principle whence He proceeds, although in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and its concept are the same; so, although in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> are the same, still, inasmuch as love requires by its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that it proceed only from the concept of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, there is a distinction of order between the procession of love and the procession of the Word in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the procession of love in God is generation?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the procession of love in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is generation. For what proceeds by way of likeness of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> among living things is said to be generated and born. But what proceeds in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by way of love proceeds in the likeness of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; otherwise it would be extraneous to the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and would be an external procession. Therefore what proceeds in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by way of love, proceeds as generated and born.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as similitude is of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the word, so does it belong to love. Hence it is said, that "every beast loves its like" (<a href="../bible/sir013.htm#verse19">Sirach 13:19</a>). Therefore if the Word is begotten and born by way of likeness, it seems becoming that love should proceed by way of generation.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, what is not in any <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is not in the genus. So if there is a procession of love in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, there ought to be some special name besides this common name of procession. But no other name is applicable but generation. Therefore the procession of love in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is generation.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Were this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, it would follow that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> Who proceeds as love, would proceed as begotten; which is against the statement of <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is from the Father and the Son, not made, nor begotten, but proceeding."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The procession of love in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> ought not to be called generation. In evidence whereof we must consider that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> differ in this respect, that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is made actual by the object understood residing according to its own likeness in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; whereas the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is made actual, not by any similitude of the object willed within it, but by its having a certain inclination to the thing willed. Thus the procession of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is by way of similitude, and is called generation, because every generator begets its own like; whereas the procession of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not by way of similitude, but rather by way of impulse and movement towards an object.

<p>So what proceeds in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by way of love, does not proceed as begotten, or as son, but proceeds rather as spirit; which name expresses a certain vital movement and impulse, accordingly as anyone is described as moved or impelled by love to perform an action.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> All that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is one with the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence the proper notion of this or that procession, by which one procession is distinguished from another, cannot be on the part of this unity: but the proper notion of this or that procession must be taken from the order of one procession to another; which order is derived from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Hence, each procession in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> takes its name from the proper notion of will and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; the name being imposed to signify what its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> really is; and so it is that the Person proceeding as love receives the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but is not said to be born.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Likeness belongs in a different way to the word and to love. It belongs to the word as being the likeness of the object understood, as the thing generated is the likeness of the generator; but it belongs to love, not as though love itself were a likeness, but because likeness is the principle of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a>. Thus it does not follow that love is begotten, but that the one begotten is the principle of love.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> We can name <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> only from creatures (13, 1). As in creatures generation is the only principle of communication of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, procession in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has no proper or special name, except that of generation. Hence the procession which is not generation has remained without a special name; but it can be called spiration, as it is the procession of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether there are more than two processions in God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there are more than two processions in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. As <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and will are attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so is power. Therefore, if two processions <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will, it seems that there must also be a third procession of power.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> seems to be the greatest principle of procession, since <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is diffusive of itself. Therefore there must be a procession of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is greater power of fecundity than in us. But in us there is not only one procession of the word, but there are many: for in us from one word proceeds another; and also from one love proceeds another. Therefore in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there are more than two processions.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> In <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there are not more than two who proceed--the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Therefore there are in Him but two processions.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The divine processions can be derived only from the actions which remain within the agent. In a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which is <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, and in the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> these actions are two, the acts of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> and of will. The act of sensation, which also appears to be an operation within the agent, takes place outside the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, nor can it be reckoned as wholly removed from the sphere of external actions; for the act of sensation is perfected by the action of the sensible object upon sense. It follows that no other procession is possible in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> but the procession of the Word, and of Love.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Power is the principle whereby one thing acts on another. Hence it is that external action points to power. Thus the divine power does not imply the procession of a divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; but is indicated by the procession therefrom of creatures.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Hebdom.), <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> belongs to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and not to the operation, unless considered as the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p>Thus, as the divine processions must be denominated from certain actions; no other processions can be understood in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> according to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and the like attributes except those of the Word and of love, according as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> understands and loves His own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As above explained (14, 5; 19, 5), <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> understands all things by one simple act; and by one act also He wills all things. Hence there cannot <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in Him a procession of Word from Word, nor of Love from Love: for there is in Him only one perfect Word, and one perfect Love; thereby being manifested His perfect fecundity.
