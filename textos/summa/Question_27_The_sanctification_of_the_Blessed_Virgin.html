<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the Blessed Virgin was sanctified before her birth from the womb?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> was not sanctified before her birth from the womb. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse46">1 Corinthians 15:46</a>): "That was not first which is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> but that which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>; afterwards that which is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>." But by <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is born spiritually into a son of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> according to <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse13">John 1:13</a>: "(who) are born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." But birth from the womb is a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> birth. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> was not sanctified before her birth from the womb.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. ad Dardan.): "The sanctification, by which we become temples of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is only of those who are born again." But no one is born again, who was not born previously. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> was not sanctified before her birth from the womb.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whoever is sanctified by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is cleansed from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, both original and actual. If, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> was sanctified before her birth from the womb, it follows that she was then cleansed from <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. Now nothing but <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> could hinder her from entering the heavenly kingdom. If therefore she had died then, it seems that she would have entered the gates of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. But this was not possible before the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion of Christ</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse19">Hebrews 10:19</a>): "We have [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'having'] therefore a confidence in the entering into the Holies by His blood." It seems therefore that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> was not sanctified before her birth from the womb.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is contracted through the origin, just as actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is contracted through an act. But as long as one is in the act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, one cannot be cleansed from actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore neither could the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> be cleansed from <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> as long as she was in the act of origin, by <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in her mother's womb.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The Church celebrates the <a href="../cathen/10712b.htm">feast of our Lady's Nativity</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not celebrate feasts except of those who are <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>. Therefore even in her birth the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> was <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>. Therefore she was sanctified in the womb.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Nothing is handed down in the <a href="../bible/index.html">canonical Scriptures</a> concerning the sanctification of the Blessed Mary as to her being sanctified in the womb; indeed, they do not even mention her birth. But as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, in his tractate on the <a href="../cathen/02006b.htm">Assumption</a> of the Virgin, argues with reason, since her body was assumed into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and yet <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> does not relate this; so it may be reasonably argued that she was sanctified in the womb. For it is reasonable to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that she, who brought forth "the Only-Begotten of the Father full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>," received greater privileges of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> than all others: hence we read (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse28">Luke 1:28</a>) that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> addressed her in the words: "Hail full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>!"

<p>Moreover, it is to be observed that it was granted, by way of privilege, to others, to be sanctified in the womb; for instance, to <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremias</a>, to whom it was said (<a href="../bible/jer001.htm#verse5">Jeremiah 1:5</a>): "Before thou camest forth out of the womb, I sanctified thee"; and again, to <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a>, of whom it is written (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse15">Luke 1:15</a>): "He shall be filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> even from his mother's womb." It is therefore with reason that we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> to have been sanctified before her birth from the womb.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Even in the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, first was that which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, and afterwards that which is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>: for she was first conceived in the flesh, and afterwards sanctified in the spirit.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> speaks according to the common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, by reason of which no one is regenerated by the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, save those who are previously born. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> did not so limit His power to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, but that He can bestow His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, by special privilege, on some before they are born from the womb.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> was sanctified in the womb from <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, as to the personal stain; but she was not freed from the guilt to which the whole <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is subject, so as to enter into Paradise otherwise than through the Sacrifice of Christ; the same also is to be said of the Holy Fathers who lived before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is transmitted through the origin, inasmuch as through the origin the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is transmitted, and <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, properly speaking, affects the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. And this takes place when the off-spring conceived is animated. Wherefore nothing hinders the offspring conceived from being sanctified after animation: for after this it remains in the mother's womb not for the purpose of receiving <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but for a certain perfecting of that which it has already received.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the Blessed Virgin was sanctified before animation?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> was sanctified before animation. Because, as we have stated (1), more <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was bestowed on the Virgin <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> than on any <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>. Now it seems to have been granted to some, to be sanctified before animation. For it is written (<a href="../bible/jer001.htm#verse5">Jeremiah 1:5</a>): "Before I formed thee in the bowels of thy mother, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> thee": and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not infused before the formation of the body. Likewise <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a> (Comment. in Luc. i, 15): "As yet the spirit of life was not in him and already he possessed the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>." Much more therefore could the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> be sanctified before animation.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm</a> says (De Concep. Virg. xviii), "it was fitting that this Virgin should shine with such a purity that under <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> none greater can be <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagined</a>": wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/son004.htm#verse7">Canticles 4:7</a>): "Thou art all fair, O my love, and there is not a spot in thee." But the purity of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> would have been greater, if she had never been stained by the contagion of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. Therefore it was granted to her to be sanctified before her flesh was animated.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as it has been stated above, no feast is celebrated except of some <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>. But some keep the feast of the Conception of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>. Therefore it seems that in her very Conception she was <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>; and hence that she was sanctified before animation.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse16">Romans 11:16</a>): "If the root be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, so are the branches." Now the root of the children is their parents. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> could be sanctified even in her parents, before animation.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The things of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> were figures of the New, according to <a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse11">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>: "All things happened to them in figure." Now the sanctification of the tabernacle, of which it is written (<a href="../bible/psa045.htm#verse5">Psalm 45:5</a>): "The most High hath sanctified His own tabernacle," seems to signify the sanctification of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, who is called "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> Tabernacle," according to <a href="../bible/psa018.htm#verse6">Psalm 18:6</a>: "He hath set His tabernacle in the sun." But of the tabernacle it is written (<a href="../bible/exo040.htm#verse31">Exodus 40:31-32</a>): "After all things were perfected, the cloud covered the tabernacle of the testimony, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord filled it." Therefore also the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> was not sanctified until after all in her was perfected, viz. her body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The sanctification of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> cannot be understood as having taken place before animation, for two reasons. First, because the sanctification of which we are speaking, is nothing but the cleansing from <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>: for sanctification is a "perfect cleansing," as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. xii). Now <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot be taken away except by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, the subject of which is the rational creature alone. Therefore before the infusion of the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> was not sanctified.

<p>Secondly, because, since the rational creature alone can be the subject of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; before the infusion of the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the offspring conceived is not liable to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And thus, in whatever manner the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> would have been sanctified before animation, she could never have incurred the stain of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>: and thus she would not have needed redemption and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> which is by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, of whom it is written (<a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse21">Matthew 1:21</a>): "He shall save His people from their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." But this is unfitting, through implying that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not the "Saviour of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>," as He is called (<a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse10">1 Timothy 4:10</a>). It remains, therefore, that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> was sanctified after animation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The Lord says that He "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>" <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremias</a> before he was formed in the womb, by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, that is to say, of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>: but He says that He "sanctified" him, not before formation, but before he "came forth out of the womb," etc. As to what <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says, viz. that in <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a> there was not the spirit of life when there was already the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, by spirit of life we are not to understand the life-giving <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but the air which we breathe out [respiratus]. Or it may be said that in him as yet there was not the spirit of life, that is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as to its manifest and complete operations.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> If the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> had never incurred the stain of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, this would be derogatory to the dignity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by reason of His being the universal Saviour of all. Consequently after <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who, as the universal Saviour of all, needed not to be saved, the purity of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> holds the highest place. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not contract <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> in any way whatever, but was <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> in His very Conception, according to <a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse35">Luke 1:35</a>: "The Holy which shall be born of thee, shall be called the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> did indeed contract <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, but was cleansed therefrom before her birth from the womb. This is what is signified (<a href="../bible/job003.htm#verse9">Job 3:9</a>) where it is written of the night of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>: "Let it expect light," i.e. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, "and not see it"--(because "no defiled thing cometh into her," as is written in <a href="../bible/wis007.htm#verse25">Wisdom 7:25</a>), "nor the rising of the dawning of the day," that is of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, who in her birth was immune from <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Rome does not celebrate the Conception of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, yet it tolerates the custom of certain churches that do keep that feast, wherefore this is not to be entirely reprobated. Nevertheless the celebration of this feast does not give us to understand that she was <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> in her conception. But since it is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> when she was sanctified, the feast of her Sanctification, rather than the feast of her Conception, is kept on the day of her conception.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Sanctification is twofold. One is that of the whole <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: inasmuch as the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is freed from all corruption of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and punishment. This will take place at the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>. The other is personal sanctification. This is not transmitted to the children begotten of the flesh: because it does not regard the flesh but the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. Consequently, though the parents of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> were cleansed from <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, nevertheless she contracted <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, since she was conceived by way of fleshly <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> and the intercourse of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>: for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Nup. et Concup. i): "All flesh born of carnal intercourse is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the Blessed Virgin was cleansed from the infection of the fomes?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> was not cleansed from the infection of the fomes. For just as the fomes, consisting in the rebellion of the lower powers against the reason, is a punishment of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>; so also are death and other corporeal penalties. Therefore the fomes was not entirely removed from her.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse9">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>): "Power is made perfect in infirmity," which refers to the weakness of the fomes, by reason of which he (the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>) felt the "sting of the flesh." But it was not fitting that anything should be taken away from the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, pertaining to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore it was unfitting that the fomes should be entirely taken away from her.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii) that "the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> came upon" the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, "purifying her," before she conceived the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. But this can only be understood of purification from the fomes: for she committed no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Nat. et Grat. xxvi). Therefore by the sanctification in the womb she was not absolutely cleansed from the fomes.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/son004.htm#verse7">Canticles 4:7</a>): "Thou art all fair, O my love, and there is not a spot in thee!" But the fomes implies a blemish, at any rate in the flesh. Therefore the fomes was not in the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> on this point there are various opinions. For some have held that the fomes was entirely taken away in that sanctification whereby the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> was sanctified in the womb. Others say that it remained as far as it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a difficulty in doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but was taken away as far as it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a proneness to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Others again, that it was taken away as to the personal corruption, by which it makes us quick to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and slow to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: but that it remained as to the corruption of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, inasmuch as it is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of transmitting <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> to the offspring. Lastly, others say that, in her first sanctification, the fomes remained <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, but was fettered; and that, when she conceived the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, it was entirely taken away. In order to understand the question at issue, it must be observed that the fomes is nothing but a certain inordinate, but <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a>, <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, for actual <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> motion. Now sensual <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is said to be inordinate, in so far as it rebels against reason; and this it does by inclining to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, or hindering from <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Consequently it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the fomes to incline to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, or hinder from <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Wherefore to say that the fomes was in the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> without an inclination to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, is to combine two contradictory statements.

<p>In like manner it seems to imply a contradiction to say that the fomes remained as to the corruption of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but not as to the personal corruption. For, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Nup. et Concup. i.), it is <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> that transmits <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> to the offspring. Now <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> implies inordinate <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, not entirely subject to reason: and therefore, if the fomes were entirely taken away as to personal corruption, it could not remain as to the corruption of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p>It remains, therefore, for us to say, either that the fomes was entirely taken away from her by her first sanctification or that it was fettered. Now that the fomes was entirely taken away, might be understood in this way, that, by the abundance of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> bestowed on the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, such a disposition of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> powers was granted to her, that the lower powers were never moved without the command of her reason: just as we have stated to have been the case with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (15, 2), who certainly did not have the fomes of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; as also was the case with <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, before he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, by reason of original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: so that, in this respect, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of sanctification in the Virgin had the force of original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. And although this appears to be part of the dignity of the Virgin Mother, yet it is somewhat derogatory to the dignity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, without whose power no one had been freed from the first sentence of condemnation. And though, through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, some were freed from that condemnation, according to the spirit, before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, yet it does not seem fitting that any one should be freed from that condemnation, according to the flesh, except after His <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, for it was then that immunity from condemnation was first to appear. Consequently, just as before the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the flesh of Christ rising again, none obtained <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the flesh, so it seems unfitting to say that before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> appeared in sinless flesh, His Virgin Mother's or anyone else's flesh should be without the fomes, which is called "the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the flesh" or "of the members" (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse23">Romans 7:23-25</a>).

<p>Therefore it seems better to say that by the sanctification in the womb, the Virgin was not freed from the fomes in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, but that it remained fettered: not indeed by an act of her reason, as in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, since she had not the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> from the very first moment of her <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in her mother's womb, for this was the singular privilege of Christ: but by reason of the abundant <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> bestowed on her in her sanctification, and still more perfectly by Divine Providence preserving her sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in a singular manner, from any inordinate movement. Afterwards, however, at the conception of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh, in which for the first time immunity from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was to be conspicuous, it is to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that entire freedom from the fomes redounded from the Child to the Mother. This indeed is signified (<a href="../bible/eze043.htm#verse2">Ezekiel 43:2</a>): "Behold the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> came in by the way of the east," i.e. by the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, "and the earth," i.e. her flesh, "shone with His," i.e. Christ's, "majesty."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Death and such like penalties do not of themselves incline us to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Wherefore though Christ assumed them, He did not assume the fomes. Consequently in order that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> might be conformed to her Son, from "whose fulness" her <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was derived, the fomes was at first fettered and afterwards taken away: while she was not freed from death and other such penalties.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The "infirmity" of the flesh, that pertains to the fomes, is indeed to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men an occasional <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: but not the "sine qua non" of perfection: and it is quite enough to ascribe to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and abundant <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: nor is there any need to attribute to her every occasional <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of perfection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> effected a twofold purification in the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>. The first was, as it were, preparatory to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> conception: which did not cleanse her from the stain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> or fomes, but rather gave her mind a unity of purpose and disengaged it from a multiplicity of things (Cf. <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a>, Div. Nom. iv), since even the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are said to be purified, in whom there is no stain, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. vi). The second purification effected in her by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was by means of the conception of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> which was the operation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. And in respect of this, it may be said that He purified her entirely from the fomes.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether by being sanctified in the womb the Blessed Virgin was preserved from all actual sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that by being sanctified in the womb the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> was not preserved from all actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For, as we have already stated (3), after her first sanctification the fomes remained in the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin</a>. Now the motion of the fomes, even if it precede the act of the reason, is a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, albeit extremely slight, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in his work De Trinitate [Cf. Sent. ii, D, 24]. Therefore there was some venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Qq. Nov. et Vet. Test. lxxiii on <a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse35">Luke 2:35</a>: "Thy own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> a sword shall pierce") says that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> "was troubled with wondering <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> at the death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>." But <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> in matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> was not preserved from all actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> (Hom. xlv in Matth.) expounding the text: "Behold thy mother and thy brethren stand without, seeking thee," says: "It is clear that they did this from mere vain <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>." Again, on <a href="../bible/joh002.htm#verse3">John 2:3</a>: "They have no wine," the same <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says that "she wished to do them a favor, and raise herself in their esteem, by means of her Son: and perchance she succumbed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> frailty, just as did His brethren when they said: 'Manifest Thyself to the world.'" And a little further on he says: "For as yet she did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him as she ought." Now it is quite clear that all this was <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> was not preserved from all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Nat. et Grat. xxxvi): "In the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it is my wish to exclude absolutely all questions concerning the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Virgin Mary, on account of the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> due to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For since she conceived and brought forth Him who most certainly was guilty of no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that an abundance of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was given her that she might be in every way the conqueror of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> so prepares and endows those, whom He chooses for some particular office, that they are rendered capable of fulfilling it, according to <a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse6">2 Corinthians 3:6</a>: "(Who) hath made us fit ministers of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>." Now the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> was chosen by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be His Mother. Therefore there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, made her worthy of that office, according to the words spoken to her by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse30">Luke 1:30-31</a>): "Thou hast found <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: behold thou shalt conceive," etc. But she would not have been worthy to be the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, if she had ever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>. First, because the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of the parents reflects on the child, according to <a href="../bible/pro017.htm#verse6">Proverbs 17:6</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of children are their fathers": and consequently, on the other hand, the Mother's shame would have reflected on her Son. Secondly, because of the singular affinity between her and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who took flesh from her: and it is written (<a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse15">2 Corinthians 6:15</a>): "What concord hath <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> with <a href="../cathen/02408a.htm">Belial</a>?" Thirdly, because of the singular manner in which the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who is the "Divine Wisdom" (<a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse24">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>) dwelt in her, not only in her <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> but in her womb. And it is written (<a href="../bible/wis001.htm#verse4">Wisdom 1:4</a>): "Wisdom will not enter into a malicious <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, nor dwell in a body subject to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>."

<p>We must therefore confess simply that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> committed no actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, neither mortal nor venial; so that what is written (<a href="../bible/son004.htm#verse7">Canticles 4:7</a>) is fulfilled: "Thou art all fair, O my love, and there is not a spot in thee," etc.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> After her sanctification the fomes remained in the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, but fettered; lest she should be surprised by some sudden inordinate act, antecedent to the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. And although the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of her sanctification contributed to this effect, yet it did not suffice; for otherwise the result of her sanctification would have been to render impossible in her any sensual movement not preceded by an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, and thus she would. not have had the fomes, which is contrary to what we have said above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). We must therefore say that the above mentioned fettering (of the fomes) was perfected by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a> not permitting any inordinate motion to result from the fomes.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> (Hom. xvii in Luc.) and certain other <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> expound these words of Simeon as referring to the sorrow which she suffered at the time of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> (in Luc. 2:35) says that the sword signifies "Mary's <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> which took note of the heavenly <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>. For the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is living and effectual, and more piercing than any two-edged sword" (<a href="../bible/heb004.htm#verse12">Hebrews 4:12</a>).

<p>Others again take the sword to signify <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. But this is to be understood of the <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, not of unbelief, but of wonder and discussion. Thus <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a> says (Ep. ad Optim.) that "the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> while standing by the cross, and observing every detail, after the message of Gabriel, and the ineffable <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Divine Conception, after that wondrous manifestation of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, was troubled in mind": that is to say, on the one side seeing Him suffer such humiliation, and on the other considering His marvelous works.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In those words <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> goes too far. They may, however, be explained as meaning that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> corrected in her, not the inordinate motion of vain <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in regard to herself, but that which might be in the thoughts of others.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether, by her sanctification in the womb, the Blessed Virgin received the fulness of grace?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that, by her sanctification in the womb, the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> did not receive the fulness or perfection of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For this seems to be Christ's privilege, according to <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John 1:14</a>: "We saw Him [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>'] as the Only-Begotten [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'as it were of the Only-Begotten'] full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." But what is proper to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> ought not to be ascribed to some one else. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> did not receive the fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> at the time of her sanctification.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, nothing remains to be added to that which is full and perfect: for "the perfect is that which lacks nothing," as is said Phys. iii. But the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> received additional <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> afterwards when she conceived Christ; for to her was it said (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse35">Luke 1:35</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> shall come upon thee: and again, when she was assumed into <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>." Therefore it seems that she did not receive the fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> at the time of her first sanctification.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does nothing useless," as is said De Coelo et Mundo i. But it would have been useless for her to have certain <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>, for she would never have put them to use: since we do not read that she taught which is the act of wisdom; or that she worked <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, which is the act of one of the gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>. Therefore she had not the fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> said to her: "Hail, full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>" (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse28">Luke 1:28</a>); which words <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> expounds as follows, in a sermon on the <a href="../cathen/02006b.htm">Assumption</a> (cf. Ep. ad Paul. et Eustoch.): "Full indeed of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: for to others it is given in portions; whereas on Mary the fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was showered all at once."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In every genus, the nearer a thing is to the principle, the greater the part which it has in the effect of that principle, whence <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. iv) that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, being nearer to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, have a greater share than men, in the effects of the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the principle of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, authoritatively as to His Godhead, instrumentally as to His humanity: whence (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse17">John 1:17</a>) it is written: "<a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> came by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin Mary</a> was nearest to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in His humanity: because He received His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> from her. Therefore it was due to her to receive a greater fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> than others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gives to each one according to the purpose for which He has chosen him. And since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> and chosen to be "<a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> in power . . . of sanctification" (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse4">Romans 1:4</a>), it was proper to Him to have such a fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that it overflowed from Him into all, according to <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse16">John 1:16</a>: "Of His fulness we have all received." Whereas the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin Mary</a> received such a fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that she was nearest of all to the Author of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; so that she received within her Him Who is full of all <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; and by bringing Him forth, she, in a manner, dispensed <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to all.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things at first there is perfection of disposition, for instance when <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is perfectly disposed for the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Secondly, there is the perfection of the form; and this is the more excellent, for the heat that proceeds from the form of fire is more perfect than that which disposed to the form of fire. Thirdly, there is the perfection of the end: for instance when fire has its <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> in the most perfect degree, having mounted to its own place.

<p>In like manner there was a threefold perfection of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>. The first was a kind of disposition, by which she was made worthy to be the mother of Christ: and this was the perfection of her sanctification. The second perfection of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> was through the presence of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> Incarnate in her womb. The third perfection of the end is that which she has in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p>That the second perfection excels the first, and the third the second, appears (1) from the point of view of deliverance from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For at first in her sanctification she was delivered from <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>: afterwards, in the conception of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, she was entirely cleansed from the fomes: lastly, in her glorification she was also delivered from all affliction whatever. It appears (2) from the point of view of ordering to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. For at first in her sanctification she received <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> inclining her to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: in the conception of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> she received consummate <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> confirming her in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and in her glorification her <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was further consummated so as to perfect her in the enjoyment of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> received in a high degree both the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of wisdom and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and even of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, just as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had them. But she did not so receive them, as to put them and such like <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> to every use, as did Christ: but accordingly as it befitted her <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of life. For she had the use of wisdom in <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, according to <a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse19">Luke 2:19</a>: "But Mary kept all these words, pondering them in her heart." But she had not the use of wisdom as to teaching: since this befitted not the female sex, according to <a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse12">1 Timothy 2:12</a>: "But I suffer not a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to teach." The use of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> did not become her while she lived: because at that time the Teaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was to be confirmed by <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and therefore it was befitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> alone, and His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> who were the bearers of His doctrine, should work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. Hence of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a> it is written (<a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse41">John 10:41</a>) that he "did no sign"; that is, in order that all might fix their attention on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. As to the use of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, it is clear that she had it, from the canticle spoken by her: "My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> doth magnify the Lord" (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse46">Luke 1:46, etc.</a>).

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether after Christ, it was proper to the Blessed Virgin to be sanctified in the womb?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it was proper for the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, after <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, to be sanctified in the womb. For it has been said (4) that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> was sanctified in the womb, in order that she might be worthy to be the mother of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But this is proper to her. Therefore she alone was sanctified in the womb.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, some men seem to have been more closely connected with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> than <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremias</a> and <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a>, who are said to have been sanctified in the womb. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is specially called the Son of David and of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, by reason of the promise specially made to them concerning Christ. Isaias also <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophesied</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in the most express terms. And the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were in converse with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself. And yet these are not mentioned as having been sanctified in the womb. Therefore it was not befitting that either <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremias</a> or <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a> should be sanctified in the womb.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08413a.htm">Job</a> says of himself (<a href="../bible/job031.htm#verse18">Job 31:18</a>): "From my infancy mercy grew up with me; and it came out with me from [my mother's] womb." Nevertheless we do not for this reason say that he was sanctified in the womb. Neither therefore are we bound to say that <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremias</a> and <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a> were sanctified in the womb.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written of <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremias</a> (<a href="../bible/jer001.htm#verse5">Jeremiah 1:5</a>): "Before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee." And of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a> it is written (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse15">Luke 1:15</a>): "He shall be filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, even from his mother's womb."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Ep. ad Dardan.) seems to speak dubiously of their (<a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremias'</a> and <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist's</a>) sanctification in the womb. For the leaping of John in the womb "might," as he says, "signify the great <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>," viz. that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was the mother of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, "which was to be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to his elders, though as yet unknown to the infant. Hence in the Gospel it is written, not that the infant in her womb <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, but that it 'leaped': and our eyes are witness that not only infants leap but also cattle. But this was unwonted because it was in the womb. And therefore, just as other <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are wont to be done, this was done divinely, in the infant; not humanly by the infant. Perhaps also in this child the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> and will was so far accelerated that while yet in his mother's womb he was able to acknowledge, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and consent, whereas in other children we have to wait for these things till they grow older: this again I count as a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> result of the divine power."

<p>But since it is expressly said (of John) in the Gospel that "he shall be filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, even from his mother's womb"; and of <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremias</a>, "Before thou camest forth out of the womb, I sanctified thee"; it seems that we must needs assert that they were sanctified in the womb, although, while in the womb, they had not the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> (which is the point discussed by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>); just as neither do children enjoy the use of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> as soon as they are sanctified by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.

<p>Nor are we to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that any others, not mentioned by <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>, were sanctified in the womb. For such privileges of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which are bestowed on some, outside the common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, are ordered for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of others, according to <a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse7">1 Corinthians 12:7</a>: "The manifestation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> is given to every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> unto profit," which would not result from the sanctification of anyone unless it were made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>And although it is not possible to assign a reason for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> judgments, for instance, why He bestows such a <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> on one and not on another, yet there seems to be a certain fittingness in both of these being sanctified in the womb, by their foreshadowing the sanctification which was to be effected through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. First, as to His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, according to <a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse12">Hebrews 13:12</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, that He might sanctify the people by His own blood, suffered without the gate": which <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremias</a> foretold openly by words and by symbols, and most clearly foreshadowed by his own sufferings. Secondly, as to His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> (<a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse11">1 Corinthians 6:11</a>): "But you are washed, but you are sanctified"; to which <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> John prepared men by his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The blessed Virgin, who was chosen by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be His Mother, received a fuller <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of sanctification than <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a> and <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremias</a>, who were chosen to foreshadow in a special way the sanctification effected by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. A sign of this is that it was granted to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> thence-forward never to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> either mortally or venially: whereas to the others who were thus sanctified it was granted thenceforward not to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> mortally, through the protection of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In other respects these <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> might be more closely united to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> than <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremias</a> and <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a>. But the latter were most closely united to Him by clearly foreshadowing His sanctification, as explained above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The mercy of which <a href="../cathen/08413a.htm">Job</a> speaks is not the infused <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; but a certain <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination to the act of that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.
