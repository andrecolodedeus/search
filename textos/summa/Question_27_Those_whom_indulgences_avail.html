<h1>Question 27. Those whom indulgences avail</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5027.htm#article1"> Do indulgences avail those who are in mortal sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5027.htm#article2"> Do they avail religious?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5027.htm#article3"> Do they avail a person who does not fulfill the conditions for which the indulgence is given?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5027.htm#article4"> Do they avail him who grants them?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether an indulgence avails those who are in mortal sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> avails those who are in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> can <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and many other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things for another, even though he be in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> derive their efficacy from the application of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>' <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> to an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. Therefore they are effective in one who is in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the greater the need, the more room there is for pity. Now a man who is in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is in very great need. Therefore all the more should pity be extended to him by <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A dead member receives no inflow from the other members that are living. But one who is in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is like a dead member. Therefore he receives no inflow, through <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, from the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> of living members.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some hold that <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> avail those even who are in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for the acquiring of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but not for the remission of their punishment, since none can be freed from punishment who is not yet freed from guilt. For he who has not yet been reached by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> operation unto the remission of guilt, cannot receive the remission of his punishment from the minister of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> neither by <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> nor in the tribunal of Penance.

<p>But this opinion seems to be untrue. Because, although those <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> which are applied by means of an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>, might possibly avail a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> so that he could <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> (by way of congruity and impetration), yet it is not for this reason that they are applied, but for the remission of punishment. Hence they do not avail those who are in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and consequently, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> and confession are demanded as <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> for gaining all <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>. If however the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> were applied by such a form as this: "I grant you a share in the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>--or of one congregation, or of one specified <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>," then they might avail a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> so that he could <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> something, as the foregoing opinion holds.

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although he who is in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is in greater need of help, yet he is less capable of receiving it.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether indulgences avail religious?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> do not avail religious. For there is no reason to bring supplies to those who supply others out of their own abundance. Now <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> are derived from the abundance of works of satisfaction to be found in religious. Therefore it is unreasonable for them to profit by <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, nothing detrimental to religious life should be done in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But, if <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> were to avail religious, this would be detrimental to regular discipline, because religious would become lax on account of <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, and would neglect the penances imposed in chapter. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> do not avail religious.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Good brings harm to no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But the religious life is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thing. Therefore it does not take away from religious the profit to be derived from <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Indulgences avail both seculars and religious, provided they have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and satisfy the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> for gaining the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>: for religious can be helped by <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> no less than <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> living in the world.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although religious are in the state of perfection, yet they cannot live without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and so if at times they are liable to punishment on account of some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, they can expiate this debt by means of <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>. For it is not unreasonable that one who is well off absolutely speaking, should be in want at times and in some respect, and thus need to be supplied with what he lacks. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse2">Galatians 6:2</a>): "Bear ye one another's burdens."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> There is no reason why <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> should be detrimental to religious observance, because, as to the reward of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, religious <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> more by observing their rule than by gaining <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>; although, as to the remission of punishment, which is a lesser <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, they <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> less. Nor again do <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> remit the punishment enjoined in chapter, because the chapter is a judicial rather than a penitential tribunal. hence even those who are not <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> hold chapter. Absolution from punishment enjoined or due for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is given in the tribunal of Penance.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether an indulgence can ever be granted to one who does not fulfill the conditions required?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> can sometimes be granted to one who does not fulfill the required conditions. Because when a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is unable to perform a certain action his <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is taken for the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>. Now sometimes an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> is to be gained by giving an <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, which a poor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is unable to do, though he would do so willingly. Therefore he can gain the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can make satisfaction for another. Now an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> is directed to the remission of punishment, just as satisfaction is. Therefore one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can gain an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> for another; and so a man can gain an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> without doing that for which the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> is given.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> If the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is removed, the effect is removed. If therefore a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> fails to do that for which an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> is granted, and which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>, he does not gain the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Failing the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of a grant, no grant ensues. Hence, as an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> is granted on the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> does or gives a certain thing, if he fails in this, he does not gain the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward, but not of certain <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> rewards, such as the remission of punishment and the like.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> can by his <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> apply his own action to whomever he lists, and so he can make satisfaction for whomever he chooses. On the other hand, an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> cannot be applied to someone, except in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the grantor. Hence, since he applies it to the doer or giver of a particular action or thing, the doer cannot transfer this <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> to another. If, however, the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> were expressed thus: "Whosoever does this, or for whomsoever this is done, shall gain so much <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>," it would avail the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> for whom it is done. Nor would the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who does this action, give the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> to another, but he who grants the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> in this form.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether an indulgence avails the person who grants it?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> does not avail him who grants it. For the granting of an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Now no one can exercise <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> on himself. thus no one can <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> himself. Therefore no one can participate in an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> granted by himself.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if this were possible, he who grants an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> might gain the remission of the punishment of all his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> for some small <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, so that he would <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with impunity, which seems senseless.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to grant <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> and to <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> belong to the same power. Now a man cannot <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> himself. Therefore he cannot share in the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> of which he is the grantor.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> He would be worse off than others if he could not make use of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> treasury which he dispenses to others.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> An <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> should be given for some reason, in order for anyone to be enticed by the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> to perform some action that conduces to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now the prelate to whom is committed the care of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and of the furthering of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, does not need to entice himself thereto. Therefore he cannot grant an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> to himself alone; but he can avail himself of an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> that he grants for others, since it is based on a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for granting it to them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot exercise an act of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> on himself, but a prelate can avail himself of those things which are granted to others by the authority of his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, both in temporal and in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> matters: thus also a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> gives himself the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> which he gives to others. And so a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> too can apply to himself the suffrages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which he dispenses to others, the immediate effect of which suffrages, and not of his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, is the remission of punishment by means of <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>. The Reply to the Second Objection is clear from what had been said.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Excommunication is pronounced by way of sentence, which no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can pronounce on himself, for the reason that in the tribunal of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> the same <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot be both judge and accused. On the other hand an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> is not given under the form of a sentence, but by way of dispensation, which a man can apply to himself.
