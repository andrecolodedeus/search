<h1>Question 28. Joy</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3028.htm#article1"> Is joy an effect of charity?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3028.htm#article2"> Is this kind of joy compatible with sorrow?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3028.htm#article3"> Can this joy be full?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3028.htm#article4"> Is it a virtue?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether joy is effected in us by charity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is not effected in us by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For the absence of what we love <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> sorrow rather than <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Whom we love by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, is absent from us, so long as we are in this state of life, since "while we are in the body, we are absent from the Lord" (<a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse6">2 Corinthians 5:6</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> sorrow in us rather than <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is chiefly through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> that we <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Now mourning, which pertains to sorrow, is reckoned among those things whereby we <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse5">Matthew 5:5</a>: "Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted." Therefore sorrow, rather than <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, is an effect of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> distinct from hope, as shown above (Question 17, Article 6). Now <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is the effect of hope, according to <a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse12">Romans 12:12</a>: "Rejoicing in hope." Therefore it is not the effect of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans 5:5</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is poured forth in our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, Who is given to us." But <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in us by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> according to <a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse17">Romans 14:17</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> is not meat and drink, but <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and peace, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (I-II, 25, 1,2,3), when we were treating of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and sorrow proceed from love, but in contrary ways. For <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by love, either through the presence of the thing loved, or because the proper <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the thing loved <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> and endures in it; and the latter is the case chiefly in the love of benevolence, whereby a man rejoices in the well-being of his friend, though he be absent. On the other hand sorrow arises from love, either through the absence of the thing loved, or because the loved object to which we wish well, is deprived of its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or afflicted with some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Whose <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is unchangeable, since He is His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, and from the very fact that He is loved, He is in those who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him by His most excellent effect, according to <a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse16">1 John 4:16</a>: "He that abideth in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, abideth in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in him." Therefore <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, which is about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> So long as we are in the body, we are said to be "absent from the Lord," in comparison with that presence whereby He is present to some by the vision of "sight"; wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> goes on to say (<a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse6">2 Corinthians 5:6</a>): "For we walk by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and not by sight." Nevertheless, even in this life, He is present to those who love Him, by the indwelling of His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The mourning that <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, is about those things that are contrary to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Wherefore it amounts to the same that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> this mourning, and this <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since to rejoice in a certain <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> amounts to the same as to grieve for things that are contrary to it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There can be <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in two ways. First, when we rejoice in the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> considered in itself; secondly, when we rejoice in the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as participated by us. The former <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is the better, and proceeds from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> chiefly: while the latter <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> proceeds from hope also, whereby we look forward to enjoy the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, although this enjoyment itself, whether perfect or imperfect, is obtained according to the measure of one's <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the spiritual joy, which results from charity, is compatible with an admixture of sorrow?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> that results from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is compatible with an admixture of sorrow. For it belongs to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> to rejoice in our neighbor's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse4">1 Corinthians 13:4-6</a>: "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> . . . rejoiceth not in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, but rejoiceth with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." But this <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is compatible with an admixture of sorrow, according to <a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse15">Romans 12:15</a>: "Rejoice with them that rejoice, weep with them that weep." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is compatible with an admixture of sorrow.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Hom. in Evang. xxxiv), "penance consists in deploring past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and in not committing again those we have deplored." But there is no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> penance without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> has an admixture of sorrow.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> desires to be with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> according to <a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse23">Philippians 1:23</a>: "Having a desire to be dissolved and to be with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." Now this desire gives rise, in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, to a certain sadness, according to <a href="../bible/psa119.htm#verse5">Psalm 119:5</a>: "Woe is me that my sojourning is prolonged!" Therefore the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> admits of a seasoning of sorrow.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> about the Divine wisdom. Now such like <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> has no admixture of sorrow, according to <a href="../bible/wis008.htm#verse16">Wisdom 8:16</a>: "Her conversation hath no bitterness." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is incompatible with an admixture of sorrow.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1, ad 3), a twofold <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> arises from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. One, the more excellent, is proper to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; and with this <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> we rejoice in the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> considered in itself. This <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is incompatible with an admixture of sorrow, even as the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is its object is incompatible with any admixture of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse4">Philippians 4:4</a>): "Rejoice in the Lord always."

<p>The other is the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> whereby we rejoice in the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as participated by us. This participation can be hindered by anything contrary to it, wherefore, in this respect, the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is compatible with an admixture of sorrow, in so far as a man grieves for that which hinders the participation of the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, either in us or in our neighbor, whom we love as ourselves.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Our neighbor does not weep save on account of some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Now every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> implies lack of participation in the sovereign <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: hence <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> makes us weep with our neighbor in so far as he is hindered from participating in the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> divide between us and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/isa059.htm#verse2">Isaiah 59:2</a>; wherefore this is the reason why we grieve for our past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, or for those of others, in so far as they hinder us from participating in the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although in this unhappy abode we participate, after a fashion, in the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and love, yet the unhappiness of this life is an obstacle to a perfect participation in the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: hence this very sorrow, whereby a man grieves for the delay of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, is connected with the hindrance to a participation of the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the spiritual joy which proceeds from charity, can be filled?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> which proceeds from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> cannot be filled. For the more we rejoice in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the more is our <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in Him filled. But we can never rejoice in Him as much as it is meet that we should rejoice in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> which is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, surpasses the creature's <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> which is finite. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can never be filled.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which is filled cannot be increased. But the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, even of the blessed, can be increased, since one's <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is greater than another's. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be filled in a creature.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, comprehension seems to be nothing else than the fulness of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Now, just as the cognitive power of a creature is finite, so is its <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power. Since therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be comprehended by any creature, it seems that no creature's <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can be filled.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> (<a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse11">John 15:11</a>): "That My <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> may be in you, and your <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> may be filled."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Fulness of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> can be understood in two ways; first, on the part of the thing rejoiced in, so that one rejoice in it as much as it is meet that one should rejoice in it, and thus <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> alone in Himself is filled, because it is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>; and this is condignly due to the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: but the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of any creature must needs be finite. Secondly, fulness of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> may be understood on the part of the one who rejoices. Now <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is compared to desire, as rest to movement, as stated above (I-II, 25, 1,2), when we were treating of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>: and rest is full when there is no more movement. Hence <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is full, when there remains nothing to be desired. But as long as we are in this world, the movement of desire does not cease in us, because it still remains possible for us to approach nearer to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as was shown above (24, 4,7). When once, however, perfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> has been attained, nothing will remain to be desired, because then there will be full enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, wherein <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will obtain whatever he had desired, even with regard to other goods, according to <a href="../bible/psa102.htm#verse5">Psalm 102:5</a>: "Who satisfieth thy desire with <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things." Hence desire will be at rest, not only our desire for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but all our desires: so that the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the blessed is full to perfection--indeed over-full, since they will obtain more than they were capable of desiring: for "neither hath it entered into the heart of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, what things <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath prepared for them that love Him" (<a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse9">1 Corinthians 2:9</a>). This is what is meant by the words of <a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse38">Luke 6:38</a>: "Good measure and pressed down, and shaken together, and running over shall they give into your bosom." Yet, since no creature is capable of the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> condignly due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it follows that this perfectly full <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is not taken into <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but, on the contrary, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> enters into it, according to <a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse21">Matthew 25:21</a>: "Enter into the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of thy Lord."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument takes the fulness of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in reference to the thing in which we rejoice.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When each one attains to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> he will reach the term appointed to him by Divine <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, and nothing further will remain to which he may tend, although by reaching that term, some will approach nearer to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than others. Hence each one's <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> will be full with regard to himself, because his desire will be fully set at rest; yet one's <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> will be greater than another's, on account of a fuller participation of the Divine <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Comprehension denotes fulness of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in respect of the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, so that it is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as much as it can be. There is however a fulness of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in respect of the knower, just as we have said of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse9">Colossians 1:9</a>): "That you may be filled with the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, in all wisdom and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> understanding."

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether joy is a virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is contrary to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now sorrow is set down as a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, as in the case of sloth and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> also should be accounted a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as love and hope are <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, the object of which is "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," so also is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. Now love and hope are reckoned to be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> also should be reckoned a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> are about acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But we are commanded to rejoice in the Lord, according to <a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse4">Philippians 4:4</a>: "Rejoice in the Lord always." Therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is not numbered among the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, nor among the moral, nor among the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as is evident from what has been said above (I-II, 57,60,62).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (I-II, 55, 2,4), <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is an operative <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, wherefore by its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> it has an inclination to a certain act. Now it may happen that from the same <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> there proceed several ordinate and homogeneous acts, each of which follows from another. And since the subsequent acts do not proceed from the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> except through the preceding act, hence it is that the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is defined and named in reference to that preceding act, although those other acts also proceed from the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now it is evident from what we have said about the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> (I-II, 25, 2,4) that love is the first affection of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, and that desire and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> follow from it. Hence the same <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> inclines us to love and desire the beloved <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and to rejoice in it. But in as much as love is the first of these acts, that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> takes its name, not from <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, nor from desire, but from love, and is called <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> distinct from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, but an act, or effect, of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: for which reason it is numbered among the Fruits (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse22">Galatians 5:22</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The sorrow which is a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by inordinate self-love, and this is not a special <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, but a general source of the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, as stated above (I-II, 77, 4); so that it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to account certain particular sorrows as special <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, because they do not arise from a special, but from a general <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. On the other hand love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is accounted a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, namely <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, to which <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> must be referred, as its proper act, as stated above (here andk22).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Hope proceeds from love even as <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> does, but hope adds, on the part of the object, a special character, viz. "difficult," and "possible to obtain"; for which reason it is accounted a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. On the other hand <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> does not add to love any special aspect, that might <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The Law prescribes <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, as being an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, albeit not its first act.
