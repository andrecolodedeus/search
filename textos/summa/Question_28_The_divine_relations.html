<h1>Question 28. The divine relations</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1028.htm#article1"> Are there real relations in God?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1028.htm#article2"> Are those relations the divine essence itself, or extrinsic to it?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1028.htm#article3"> Can there be several relations distinct from each other in God?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1028.htm#article4"> The number of these relations</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether there are real relations in God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there are no real relations in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Trin. iv), "All possible predicaments used as regards the Godhead refer to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>; for nothing can be predicated relatively." But whatever really <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can be predicated of Him. Therefore no real relation <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Trin. iv) that, "Relation in the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> of the Father to the Son, and of both to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, is the relation of the same to the same." But a relation of this kind is only a <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> one; for every real relation requires and implies in reality two terms. Therefore the divine relations are not real relations, but are formed only by the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the relation of paternity is the relation of a principle. But to say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the principle of creatures does not import any real relation, but only a <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> one. Therefore paternity in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not a real relation; while the same applies for the same reason to the other relations in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the divine generation proceeds by way of an intelligible word. But the relations following upon the operation of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> are <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> relations. Therefore paternity and filiation in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, consequent upon generation, are only <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> relations.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The Father is denominated only from paternity; and the Son only from filiation. Therefore, if no real paternity or filiation <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it would follow that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not really Father or Son, but only in our manner of understanding; and this is the Sabellian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> relations <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> really; in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> whereof we may consider that in relations alone is found something which is only in the apprehension and not in reality. This is not found in any other genus; forasmuch as other genera, as <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> and <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, in their strict and proper meaning, signify something inherent in a subject. But relation in its own proper meaning signifies only what refers to another. Such regard to another <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> sometimes in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of things, as in those things which by their own very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> are ordered to each other, and have a mutual inclination; and such relations are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> real relations; as in a heavy body is found an inclination and order to the centre; and hence there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in the heavy body a certain respect in regard to the centre and the same applies to other things. Sometimes, however, this regard to another, signified by relation, is to be found only in the apprehension of reason comparing one thing to another, and this is a <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> relation only; as, for instance, when reason compares <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to animal as the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> to the genus. But when something proceeds from a principle of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, then both the one proceeding and the source of procession, agree in the same order; and then they have real relations to each other. Therefore as the divine processions are in the identity of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as above explained (27, 2, 4), these relations, according to the divine processions, are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> real relations.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Relationship is not predicated of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> according to its proper and formal meaning, that is to say, in so far as its proper meaning denotes comparison to that in which relation is inherent, but only as denoting regard to another. Nevertheless <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> did not wish to exclude relation in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but he wished to show that it was not to be predicated of Him as regards the mode of inherence in Himself in the strict meaning of relation; but rather by way of relation to another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The relation signified by the term "the same" is a <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> relation only, if in regard to absolutely the same thing; because such a relation can <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> only in a certain order observed by reason as regards the order of anything to itself, according to some two aspects thereof. The case is otherwise, however, when things are called the same, not numerically, but generically or specifically. Thus <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> likens the divine relations to a relation of identity, not in every respect, but only as regards the fact that the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is not diversified by these relations, as neither is it by relation of identity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As the creature proceeds from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in diversity of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is outside the order of the whole creation, nor does any relation to the creature arise from His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; for He does not produce the creature by <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but by His <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will, as is above explained (14, 3 and 4; 19, 8). Therefore there is no real relation in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to the creature; whereas in creatures there is a real relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; because creatures are contained under the divine order, and their very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> entails dependence on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. On the other hand, the divine processions are in one and the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence no parallel <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Relations which result from the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> operation alone in the objects understood are <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> relations only, inasmuch as reason observes them as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> between two objects perceived by the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. Those relations, however, which follow the operation of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> between the word <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectually</a> proceeding and the source whence it proceeds, are not <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> relations only, but are real relations; inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and the reason are real things, and are really related to that which proceeds from them intelligibly; as a corporeal thing is related to that which proceeds from it corporeally. Thus paternity and filiation are real relations in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether relation in God is the same as His essence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the divine relation is not the same as the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. v) that "not all that is said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said of His <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, for we say some things relatively, as Father in respect of the Son: but such things do not refer to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>." Therefore the relation is not the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. vii) that, "every relative expression is something besides the relation expressed, as master is a man, and <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> is a man." Therefore, if relations <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, there must be something else besides relation in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This can only be His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> differs from relation.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of relation is the being referred to another, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Praedic. v). So if relation is the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, it follows that the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> itself a relation to something else; whereas this is repugnant to the perfection of the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, which is supremely absolute and self-subsisting (3, 4). Therefore relation is not the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Everything which is not the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is a creature. But relation really belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and if it is not the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, it is a creature; and it cannot claim the adoration of <a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>; contrary to what is sung in the Preface: "Let us <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> the distinction of the Persons, and the equality of their Majesty."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is reported that Gilbert de la Porree <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erred</a> on this point, but revoked his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> later at the council of Rheims. For he said that the divine relations are assistant, or externally affixed.

<p>To perceive the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> here expressed, we must consider that in each of the nine genera of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> there are two points for remark. One is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> belonging to each one of them considered as an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>; which commonly applies to each of them as inherent in a subject, for the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> is to inhere. The other point of remark is the proper <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of each one of these genera. In the genera, apart from that of "relation," as in <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> and <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, even the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the genus itself is derived from a respect to the subject; for <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> is called the measure of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> is the disposition of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of relation is not taken from its respect to that in which it is, but from its respect to something outside. So if we consider even in creatures, relations formally as such, in that aspect they are said to be "assistant," and not intrinsically affixed, for, in this way, they signify a respect which affects a thing related and tends from that thing to something else; whereas, if relation is considered as an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, it inheres in a subject, and has an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in it. Gilbert de la Porree considered relation in the former mode only.

<p>Now whatever has an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in creatures, when considered as transferred to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; for there is no <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; since all in Him is His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. So, in so far as relation has an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in creatures, relation really <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> in no way distinct therefrom. But in so far as relation implies respect to something else, no respect to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is signified, but rather to its opposite term.

<p>Thus it is manifest that relation really <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is really the same as His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and only differs in its mode of intelligibility; as in relation is meant that regard to its opposite which is not expressed in the name of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Thus it is clear that in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> relation and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> do not differ from each other, but are one and the same.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> These words of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> do not imply that paternity or any other relation which is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not in its very being the same as the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; but that it is not predicated under the mode of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in Him to Whom it is applied; but as a relation. So there are said to be two predicaments only in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since other predicaments import habitude to that of which they are spoken, both in their generic and in their specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; but nothing that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can have any relation to that wherein it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> or of whom it is spoken, except the relation of identity; and this by reason of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> supreme simplicity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As the relation which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in creatures involves not only a regard to another, but also something absolute, so the same applies to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet not in the same way. What is contained in the creature above and beyond what is contained in the meaning of relation, is something else besides that relation; whereas in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is no distinction, but both are one and the same; and this is not perfectly expressed by the word "relation," as if it were comprehended in the ordinary meaning of that term. For it was above explained (13, 2), in treating of the divine names, that more is contained in the perfection of the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> than can be signified by any name. Hence it does not follow that there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> anything besides relation in reality; but only in the various names imposed by us.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If the divine perfection contained only what is signified by relative names, it would follow that it is imperfect, being thus related to something else; as in the same way, if nothing more were contained in it than what is signified by the word "wisdom," it would not in that case be a subsistence. But as the perfection of the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is greater than can be included in any name, it does not follow, if a relative term or any other name applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> signify something imperfect, that the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is in any way imperfect; for the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> comprehends within itself the perfection of every genus (4, 2).

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the relations in God are really distinguished from each other?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the divine relations are not really distinguished from each other. For things which are identified with the same, are identified with each other. But every relation in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is really the same as the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Therefore the relations are not really distinguished from each other.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as paternity and filiation are by name distinguished from the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, so likewise are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and power. But this kind of distinction does not make any real distinction of the divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and power. Therefore neither does it make any real distinction of paternity and filiation.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is no real distinction but that of origin. But one relation does not seem to arise from another. Therefore the relations are not really distinguished from each other.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Trin.) that in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> contains the unity; and relation multiplies the trinity." Therefore, if the relations were not really distinguished from each other, there would be no real trinity in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but only an ideal trinity, which is the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of Sabellius.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The attributing of anything to another involves the attribution likewise of whatever is contained in it. So when "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" is attributed to anyone, a rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is likewise attributed to him. The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of relation, however, <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> means regard of one to another, according as one is relatively opposed to another. So as in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is a real relation (1), there must also be a real opposition. The very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of relative opposition includes distinction. Hence, there must be real distinction in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not, indeed, according to that which is absolute--namely, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, wherein there is supreme unity and simplicity--but according to that which is relative.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Phys. iii), this argument holds, that whatever things are identified with the same thing are identified with each other, if the identity be real and <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a>; as, for instance, a <a href="../cathen/15087a.htm">tunic</a> and a garment; but not if they differ <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a>. Hence in the same place he says that although action is the same as motion, and likewise passion; still it does not follow that action and passion are the same; because action implies reference as of something "from which" there is motion in the thing moved; whereas passion implies reference as of something "which is from" another. Likewise, although paternity, just as filiation, is really the same as the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; nevertheless these two in their own proper <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> and definitions import opposite respects. Hence they are distinguished from each other.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Power and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> do not import any opposition in their respective <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>; and hence there is no parallel argument.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although relations, properly speaking, do not arise or proceed from each other, nevertheless they are considered as opposed according to the procession of one from another.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether in God there are only four real relations--paternity, filiation, spiration, and procession?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there are not only four real relations--paternity, filiation, spiration and procession. For it must be observed that in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> the relations of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> agent to the object understood; and of the one willing to the object willed; which are real relations not comprised under those above specified. Therefore there are not only four real relations in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, real relations in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are understood as coming from the intelligible procession of the Word. But intelligible relations are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> multiplied, as <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a> says. Therefore in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> series of real relations.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> (15, 1); and are only distinguished from each other by reason of their regard to things, as above stated. Therefore in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there are many more <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> relations.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, equality, and likeness, and identity are relations: and they are in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. Therefore several more relations are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than the above named.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, it may also contrariwise be said that there are fewer relations in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than those above named. For, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Phys. iii text 24), "It is the same way from Athens to Thebes, as from Thebes to Athens." By the same way of reasoning there is the same relation from the Father to the Son, that of paternity, and from the Son to the Father, that of filiation; and thus there are not four relations in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. v), every relation is based either on <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, as double and half; or on action and passion, as the doer and the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, the father and the son, the master and the servant, and the like. Now as there is no <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for He is great without <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. i, 1) it follows that a real relation in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can be based only on action. Such relations are not based on the actions of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> according to any extrinsic procession, forasmuch as the relations of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to creatures are not real in Him (13, 7). Hence, it follows that real relations in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can be understood only in regard to those actions according to which there are internal, and not external, processions in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. These processions are two only, as above explained (27, 5), one derived from the action of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, the procession of the Word; and the other from the action of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, the procession of love. In respect of each of these processions two opposite relations arise; one of which is the relation of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> proceeding from the principle; the other is the relation of the principle Himself. The procession of the Word is called generation in the proper sense of the term, whereby it is applied to living things. Now the relation of the principle of generation in perfect living beings is called paternity; and the relation of the one proceeding from the principle is called filiation. But the procession of Love has no proper name of its own (27, 4); and so neither have the ensuing relations a proper name of their own. The relation of the principle of this procession is called spiration; and the relation of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> proceeding is called procession: although these two names belong to the processions or origins themselves, and not to the relations.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In those things in which there is a difference between the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and its object, and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and its object, there can be a real relation, both of science to its object, and of the willer to the object willed. In <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, however, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and its object are one and the same; because by understanding Himself, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> understands all other things; and the same applies to His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and the object that He wills. Hence it follows that in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> these kinds of relations are not real; as neither is the relation of a thing to itself. Nevertheless, the relation to the word is a real relation; because the word is understood as proceeding by an intelligible action; and not as a thing understood. For when we understand a stone; that which the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> conceives from the thing understood, is called the word.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Intelligible relations in ourselves are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> multiplied, because a man understands a stone by one act, and by another act understands that he understands the stone, and again by another, understands that he understands this; thus the acts of understanding are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> multiplied, and consequently also the relations understood. This does not apply to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, inasmuch as He understands all things by one act alone.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Ideal relations <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> as understood by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence it does not follow from their plurality that there are many relations in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> these many relations.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Equality and similitude in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are not real relations; but are only <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> relations (42, 3, ad 4).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The way from one term to another and conversely is the same; nevertheless the mutual relations are not the same. Hence, we cannot conclude that the relation of the father to the son is the same as that of the son to the father; but we could conclude this of something absolute, if there were such between them.
