<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether union is an effect of love?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that union is not an effect of love. For absence is incompatible with union. But love is compatible with absence; for the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse18">Galatians 4:18</a>): "Be zealous for that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thing always" (speaking of himself, according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a>), "and not only when I am present with you." Therefore union is not an effect of love.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every union is either according to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, thus form is united to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> to subject, and a part to the whole, or to another part in order to make up the whole: or according to likeness, in genus, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, or <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>. But love does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> union of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; else love could not be between things <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> distinct. On the other hand, love does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> union of likeness, but rather is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by it, as stated above (Question 27, Article 3). Therefore union is not an effect of love.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the sense in act is the sensible in act, and the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in act is the thing actually understood. But the lover in act is not the beloved in act. Therefore union is the effect of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> rather than of love.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that every love is a "unitive love."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The union of lover and beloved is twofold. The first is real union; for instance, when the beloved is present with the lover. The second is union of affection: and this union must be considered in relation to the preceding apprehension; since movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> follows apprehension. Now love being twofold, viz. love of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> and love of friendship; each of these arises from a kind of apprehension of the oneness of the thing loved with the lover. For when we love a thing, by desiring it, we apprehend it as belonging to our well-being. In like manner when a man loves another with the love of friendship, he wills <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to him, just as he wills <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to himself: wherefore he apprehends him as his other self, in so far, to wit, as he wills <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to him as to himself. Hence a friend is called a man's "other self" (Ethic. ix, 4), and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. iv, 6), "Well did one say to his friend: Thou half of my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>."

<p>The first of these unions is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> "effectively" by love; because love moves <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to desire and seek the presence of the beloved, as of something suitable and belonging to him. The second union is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> "formally" by love; because love itself is this union or bond. In this sense <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. viii, 10) that "love is a vital principle uniting, or seeking to unite two together, the lover, to wit, and the beloved." For in describing it as "uniting" he refers to the union of affection, without which there is no love: and in saying that "it seeks to unite," he refers to real union.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of real union. That is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to pleasure as being its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; desire implies the real absence of the beloved: but love remains whether the beloved be absent or present.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Union has a threefold relation to love. There is union which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> love; and this is <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> union, as regards the love with which one loves oneself; while as regards the love wherewith one loves other things, it is the union of likeness, as stated above (Question 27, Article 3). There is also a union which is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> love itself. This union is according to a bond of affection, and is likened to <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> union, inasmuch as the lover stands to the object of his love, as to himself, if it be love of friendship; as to something belonging to himself, if it be love of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. Again there is a union, which is the effect of love. This is real union, which the lover seeks with the object of his love. Moreover this union is in keeping with the demands of love: for as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> relates (Polit. ii, 1), "Aristophanes stated that lovers would wish to be united both into one," but since "this would result in either one or both being destroyed," they seek a suitable and becoming union--to live together, speak together, and be united together in other like things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowledge</a> is perfected by the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> being united, through its likeness, to the knower. But the effect of love is that the thing itself which is loved, is, in a way, united to the lover, as stated above. Consequently the union <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by love is closer than that which is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether mutual indwelling is an effect of love?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that love does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> mutual indwelling, so that the lover be in the beloved and vice versa. For that which is in another is contained in it. But the same cannot be container and contents. Therefore love cannot <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> mutual indwelling, so that the lover be in the beloved and vice versa.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, nothing can penetrate within a whole, except by means of a division of the whole. But it is the function of the reason, not of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> where love resides, to divide things that are really united. Therefore mutual indwelling is not an effect of love.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if love involves the lover being in the beloved and vice versa, it follows that the beloved is united to the lover, in the same way as the lover is united to the beloved. But the union itself is love, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore it follows that the lover is always loved by the object of his love; which is evidently <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Therefore mutual indwelling is not an effect of love.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse16">1 John 4:16</a>): "He that abideth in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> abideth in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in him." Now <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore, for the same reason, every love makes the beloved to be in the lover, and vice versa.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> This effect of mutual indwelling may be understood as referring both to the apprehensive and to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power. Because, as to the apprehensive power, the beloved is said to be in the lover, inasmuch as the beloved abides in the apprehension of the lover, according to <a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse7">Philippians 1:7</a>, "For that I have you in my heart": while the lover is said to be in the beloved, according to apprehension, inasmuch as the lover is not satisfied with a superficial apprehension of the beloved, but strives to gain an intimate <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of everything pertaining to the beloved, so as to penetrate into his very <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Thus it is written concerning the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, Who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> Love, that He "searcheth all things, yea the deep things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse10">1 Corinthians 2:10</a>).

<p>As the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, the object loved is said to be in the lover, inasmuch as it is in his affections, by a kind of complacency: <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> him either to take pleasure in it, or in its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, when present; or, in the absence of the object loved, by his longing, to tend towards it with the love of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, or towards the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that he wills to the beloved, with the love of friendship: not indeed from any extrinsic <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> (as when we desire one thing on account of another, or wish <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to another on account of something else), but because the complacency in the beloved is rooted in the lover's heart. For this reason we speak of love as being "intimate"; and "of the bowels of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>." On the other hand, the lover is in the beloved, by the love of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> and by the love of friendship, but not in the same way. For the love of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is not satisfied with any external or superficial possession or enjoyment of the beloved; but seeks to possess the beloved perfectly, by penetrating into his heart, as it were. Whereas, in the love of friendship, the lover is in the beloved, inasmuch as he reckons what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to his friend, as being so to himself; and his friend's will as his own, so that it seems as though he felt the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or suffered the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of his friend. Hence it is proper to friends "to desire the same things, and to grieve and rejoice at the same," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ix, 3 and Rhet. ii, 4). Consequently in so far as he reckons what affects his friend as affecting himself, the lover seems to be in the beloved, as though he were become one with him: but in so far as, on the other hand, he wills and acts for his friend's sake as for his own sake, looking on his friend as identified with himself, thus the beloved is in the lover.

<p>In yet a third way, mutual indwelling in the love of friendship can be understood in regard to reciprocal love: inasmuch as friends return love for love, and both desire and do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things for one another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The beloved is contained in the lover, by being impressed on his heart and thus becoming the object of his complacency. On the other hand, the lover is contained in the beloved, inasmuch as the lover penetrates, so to speak, into the beloved. For nothing hinders a thing from being both container and contents in different ways: just as a genus is contained in its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and vice versa.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The apprehension of the reason precedes the movement of love. Consequently, just as the reason divides, so does the movement of love penetrate into the beloved, as was explained above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the third kind of mutual indwelling, which is not to be found in every kind of love.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether ecstasy is an effect of love?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a> is not an effect of love. For <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a> seems to imply loss of reason. But love does not always result in loss of reason: for lovers are masters of themselves at times. Therefore love does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the lover desires the beloved to be united to him. Therefore he draws the beloved to himself, rather than betakes himself into the beloved, going forth out from himself as it were.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, love unites the beloved to the lover, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). If, therefore, the lover goes out from himself, in order to betake himself into the beloved, it follows that the lover always loves the beloved more than himself: which is evidently <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a> is not an effect of love.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that "the Divine love produces <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a>," and that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself suffered <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a> through love." Since therefore according to the same author (Div. Nom. iv), every love is a participated likeness of the Divine Love, it seems that every love <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> To suffer <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a> means to be placed outside oneself. This happens as to the apprehensive power and as to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power. As to the apprehensive power, a man is said to be placed outside himself, when he is placed outside the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> proper to him. This may be due to his being raised to a higher <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; thus, a man is said to suffer <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a>, inasmuch as he is placed outside the connatural apprehension of his sense and reason, when he is raised up so as to comprehend things that surpass sense and reason: or it may be due to his being cast down into a state of debasement; thus a man may be said to suffer <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a>, when he is overcome by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> passion or <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>. As to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, a man is said to suffer <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a>, when that power is borne towards something else, so that it goes forth out from itself, as it were.

<p>The first of these ecstasies is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by love dispositively in so far, namely, as love makes the lover dwell on the beloved, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), and to dwell intently on one thing draws the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> from other things. The second <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by love directly; by love of friendship, simply; by love of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> not simply but in a restricted sense. Because in love of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, the lover is carried out of himself, in a certain sense; in so far, namely, as not being satisfied with enjoying the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that he has, he seeks to enjoy something outside himself. But since he seeks to have this extrinsic <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for himself, he does not go out from himself simply, and this movement remains finally within him. On the other hand, in the love of friendship, a man's affection goes out from itself simply; because he wishes and does <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to his friend, by caring and providing for him, for his sake.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the first kind of <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument applies to love of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, which, as stated above, does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a> simply.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> He who loves, goes out from himself, in so far as he wills the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of his friend and works for it. Yet he does not will the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of his friend more than his own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: and so it does not follow that he loves another more than himself.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether zeal is an effect of love?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that zeal is not an effect of love. For zeal is a beginning of contention; wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse3">1 Corinthians 3:3</a>): "Whereas there is among you zeal [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'envying'] and contention," etc. But contention is incompatible with love. Therefore zeal is not an effect of love.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the object of love is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which communicates itself to others. But zeal is opposed to communication; since it seems an effect of zeal, that a man refuses to share the object of his love with another: thus husbands are said to be jealous of [zelare] their wives, because they will not share them with others. Therefore zeal is not an effect of love.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, there is no zeal without <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, as neither is there without love: for it is written (<a href="../bible/psa072.htm#verse3">Psalm 72:3</a>): "I had a zeal on occasion of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>." Therefore it should not be set down as an effect of love any more than of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said to be a zealot, on account of his great love for all things."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Zeal, whatever way we take it, arises from the intensity of love. For it is evident that the more intensely a power tends to anything, the more vigorously it withstands opposition or resistance. Since therefore love is "a movement towards the object loved," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. 83, qu. 35), an intense love seeks to remove everything that opposes it.

<p>But this happens in different ways according to love of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, and love of friendship. For in love of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> he who desires something intensely, is moved against all that hinders his gaining or quietly enjoying the object of his love. It is thus that husbands are said to be jealous of their wives, lest association with others <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> a hindrance to their exclusive <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> rights. In like manner those who seek to excel, are moved against those who seem to excel, as though these were a hindrance to their excelling. And this is the zeal of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, of which it is written (<a href="../bible/psa036.htm#verse1">Psalm 36:1</a>): "Be not emulous of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> doers, nor <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> [zelaveris] them that work <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>."

<p>On the other hand, love of friendship seeks the friend's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: wherefore, when it is intense, it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a man to be moved against everything that opposes the friend's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. In this respect, a man is said to be zealous on behalf of his friend, when he makes a point of repelling whatever may be said or done against the friend's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. In this way, too, a man is said to be zealous on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> behalf, when he endeavors, to the best of his means, to repel whatever is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> or will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; according to <a href="../bible/1ki019.htm#verse14">1 Kings 19:14</a>: "With zeal I have been zealous for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>." Again on the words of <a href="../bible/joh002.htm#verse17">John 2:17</a>: "The zeal of Thy house hath eaten me up," a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says that "a man is eaten up with a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> zeal, who strives to remedy whatever <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> he perceives; and if he cannot, bears with it and laments it."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> is speaking in this passage of the zeal of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>; which is indeed the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of contention, not against the object of love, but for it, and against that which is opposed to it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Good is loved inasmuch as it can be communicated to the lover. Consequently whatever hinders the perfection of this communication, becomes hateful. Thus zeal arises from love of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But through defect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, it happens that certain small goods cannot, in their entirety, be possessed by many at the same time: and from the love of such things arises the zeal of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>. But it does not arise, properly speaking, in the case of those things which, in their entirety, can be possessed by many: for no one envies another the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> entirely by many; except perhaps one may <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> another his superiority in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The very fact that a man <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> whatever is opposed to the object of his love, is the effect of love. Hence zeal is set down as an effect of love rather than of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether love is a passion that wounds the lover?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that love wounds the lover. For languor denotes a hurt in the one that languishes. But love <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> languor: for it is written (<a href="../bible/son002.htm#verse5">Canticles 2:5</a>): "Stay me up with flowers, compass me about with apples; because I languish with love." Therefore love is a wounding passion.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, melting is a kind of dissolution. But love melts that in which it is: for it is written (<a href="../bible/son005.htm#verse6">Canticles 5:6</a>): "My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> melted when my beloved spoke." Therefore love is a dissolvent: therefore it is a corruptive and a wounding passion.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, fervor denotes a certain excess of heat; which excess has a corruptive effect. But love <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> fervor: for <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Coel. Hier. vii) in reckoning the properties belonging to the <a href="../cathen/13725b.htm">Seraphim's</a> love, includes "hot" and "piercing" and "most fervent." Moreover it is said of love (<a href="../bible/son008.htm#verse6">Canticles 8:6</a>) that "its lamps are fire and flames." Therefore love is a wounding and corruptive passion.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that "everything loves itself with a love that holds it together," i.e. that preserves it. Therefore love is not a wounding passion, but rather one that preserves and perfects.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (26, 1,2; 27, 1), love denotes a certain adapting of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power to some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now nothing is hurt by being adapted to that which is suitable to it; rather, if possible, it is perfected and bettered. But if a thing be adapted to that which is not suitable to it, it is hurt and made worse thereby. Consequently love of a suitable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> perfects and betters the lover; but love of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is unsuitable to the lover, wounds and worsens him. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is perfected and bettered chiefly by the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: but is wounded and worsened by the love of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/hos009.htm#verse10">Hosea 9:10</a>: "They became abominable, as those things which they loved."

<p>And let this be understood as applying to love in respect of its formal element, i.e. in regard to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. But in respect of the material element in the passion of love, i.e. a certain bodily change, it happens that love is hurtful, by reason of this change being excessive: just as it happens in the senses, and in every act of a power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that is exercised through the change of some bodily organ.

<p>In reply to the objections, it is to be observed that four proximate effects may be ascribed to love: viz. melting, enjoyment, languor, and fervor. Of these the first is "melting," which is opposed to freezing. For things that are frozen, are closely bound together, so as to be hard to pierce. But it belongs to love that the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is fitted to receive the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is loved, inasmuch as the object loved is in the lover, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Consequently the freezing or hardening of the heart is a disposition incompatible with love: while melting denotes a softening of the heart, whereby the heart shows itself to be ready for the entrance of the beloved. If, then, the beloved is present and possessed, pleasure or enjoyment ensues. But if the beloved be absent, two <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> arise; viz. sadness at its absence, which is denoted by "languor" (hence Cicero in De Tusc. Quaest. iii, 11 applies the term "ailment" chiefly to sadness); and an intense desire to possess the beloved, which is signified by "fervor." And these are the effects of love considered formally, according to the relation of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power to its object. But in the passion of love, other effects ensue, proportionate to the above, in respect of a change in the organ.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether love is cause of all that the lover does?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the lover does not do everything from love. For love is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, as stated above (Question 26, Article 2). But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not do everything from passion: but some things he does from choice, and some things from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, as stated in Ethic. v, 8. Therefore not everything that a man does, is done from love.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is a principle of movement and action in all animals, as stated in De Anima iii, 10. If, therefore, whatever a man does is done from love, the other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> faculty are superfluous.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, nothing is produced at one and the same time by contrary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. But some things are done from <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. Therefore all things are not done from love.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that "all things, whatever they do, they do for the love of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Every agent acts for an end, as stated above (Question 1, Article 2). Now the end is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> desired and loved by each one. Wherefore it is evident that every agent, whatever it be, does every action from love of some kind.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This objection takes love as a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. But here we are speaking of love in a general sense, inasmuch as it includes <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, rational, animal, and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love: for it is in this sense that <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> speaks of love in chapter iv of De Divinis Nominibus.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above (05; 27, 4) desire, sadness and pleasure, and consequently all the other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, result from love. Wherefore every act proceeds from any passion, proceeds also from love as from a first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: and so the other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, which are proximate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, are not superfluous.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Hatred also is a result of love, as we shall state further on (29, 2).
