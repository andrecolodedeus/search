<h1>Question 28. The solemn rite of penance</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5028.htm#article1"> Can a penance be published or solemnized?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5028.htm#article2"> Can a solemn penance be repeated?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5028.htm#article3"> Should public penance be imposed on women?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether a penance should be published or solemnized?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a penance should not be published or solemnized. Because it is not lawful for a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, even through fear, to divulge anyone's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, however <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> it may be. Now a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is published by a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> penance. Therefore a penance should not be solemnized.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the judgment should follow the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the tribunal. Now penance is a judgment pronounced in a secret tribunal. Therefore it should not be published or solemnized.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "Every deficiency is made <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by penance" as <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> [Cf. Hypognost. iii, among the spurious works ascribed to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>] states. Now solemnization has a contrary effect, since it involves the penitent in many deficiencies: for a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> cannot be promoted to the ranks of the clergy nor can a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> be promoted to higher orders, after doing <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> penance. Therefore Penance should not be solemnized.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Penance is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Now some kind of <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> is observed in every sacrament. Therefore there should be some <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> in Penance.

<p>Further, the medicine should suit the disease. Now a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is sometimes public, and by its example draws many to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore the penance which is its medicine should also be public and <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> so as to give edification to many.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some penances should be public and <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> for four reasons. First, so that a public <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may have a public remedy; secondly, because he who has committed a very grave crime deserves the greatest confusion even in this life; thirdly, in order that it may deter others; fourthly, that he may be an example of repentance, lest those should <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, who have committed grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> does not divulge the confession by imposing such a penance, though people may suspect the penitent of having committed some great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For a man is not certainly taken to be guilty, because he is punished, since sometimes one does penance for another: thus we read in the Lives of the Fathers of a certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who, in order to incite his companion to do penance, did penance together with him. And if the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be public, the penitent, by fulfilling his penance, shows that he has been to confession.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> penance, as to its imposition, does not go beyond the limits of a secret tribunal, since, just as the confession is made secretly, so the penance is imposed secretly. It is the execution of the penance, that goes beyond the limits of the secret tribunal: and there is nothing objectionable in this.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although Penance cancels all deficiencies, by restoring <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to his former state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a>, yet it does not always restore him to his former dignity. Hence <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> after doing penance for fornication are not given the veil, because they do not recover the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. In like manner, after doing public penance, a sinner does not recover his former dignity so as to be eligible for the clerical state and a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who would ordain such a one ought to be deprived of the power of ordaining, unless perhaps the needs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> or custom require it. In that case such a one would be admitted to <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>by way of exception, but not to the sacred orders. First, on account of the dignity of the latter; secondly, for fear of relapse; thirdly, in order to avoid the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> which the people might take through recollection of his former <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; fourthly, because he would not have the face to correct others, by reason of the publicity of his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether a solemn penance can be repeated?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> penance can be repeated. For those <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which do not imprint a character, can be solemnized a second time, such as the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> and the like. But Penance does not imprint a character, therefore it can be solemnized over again.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, penance is solemnized on account of the gravity and publicity of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now, after doing penance, a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> may commit the same <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> over again, or even more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> penance should be imposed again.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Solemn penance signifies the expulsion of the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from paradise. Now this was done but once. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> penance should be imposed once only.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Solemn penance ought not to be repeated, for three reasons. First, lest frequency bring it into contempt. Secondly, on account of its signification; for it signifies the expulsion of the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from paradise, which happened only once; thirdly, because the solemnization indicates, in a way, that one makes profession of continual repentance. Wherefore repetition is inconsistent with solemnization. And if the sinner fall again, he is not precluded from doing penance, but a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> penance should not be imposed on him again.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In those <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which are solemnized again and again, repetition is not inconsistent with <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a>, as it is in the present case. Hence the comparison fails.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although, if we consider his crime, he ought to do the same penance again, yet the repeated solemnization is not becoming, for the reasons stated above.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether solemn penance should be imposed on women and clerics, and whether any priest can impose it?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> penance should not be imposed on <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. Because, when this penance is imposed on a man, he has to cut his hair off. But this becomes not a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse15">1 Corinthians 11:15</a>. Therefore she should not do <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> penance.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> It also seems that it ought to be imposed on <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>. For it is enjoined on account of a grievous crime. Now the same <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is more grievous in a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> than in a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>. Therefore it ought to be imposed on a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> more than on a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> It also seems that it can be imposed by any priest. Because to <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> in the tribunal of Penance belongs to one who has the keys. Now an ordinary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> has the keys. Therefore he can administer this penance.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Every <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> penance is public, but not vice versa. For <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> penance is done as follows: "On the first day of Lent, these penitents clothed in sackcloth, with bare feet, their faces to the ground, and their hair shorn away, accompanied by their <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, present themselves to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city at the door of the church. Having brought them into the church the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> with all his clergy recites the seven penitential psalms, and then imposes his hand on them, sprinkles them with <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> water, puts ashes on their heads, covers their shoulders with a hairshirt, and sorrowfully announces to them that as <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was expelled from paradise, so are they expelled from the church. He then orders the ministers to put them out of the church, and the clergy follow reciting the responsory: 'In the sweat of thy brow,' etc. Every year on the day of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> Supper they are brought back into the church by their <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and there shall they be until the octave day of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, without however being admitted to Communion or to the kiss of peace. This shall be done every year as long as entrance into the church is forbidden them. The final reconciliation is reserved to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who alone can impose <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> penance" [Cap. lxiv, dist. 50].

<p>This penance can be imposed on men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; but not on <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, for fear of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>. Nor ought such a penance to be imposed except for a crime which has disturbed the whole of the city.

<p>On the other hand public but not <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> penance is that which is done in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but without the foregoing <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a>, such as a pilgrimage throughout the world with a staff. A penance of this kind can be repeated, and can be imposed by a mere <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, even on a cleric. Sometimes however a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> penance is taken to signify a public one: so that authorities speak of <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> penance in different senses.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> hair is a sign of her subjection, a man's is not. Hence it is not proper for a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to put aside her hair when doing penance, as it is for a man.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although in the same kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> offends more grievously than a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, yet a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> penance is not imposed on him, lest his orders should be an object of contempt. Thus deference is given not to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> but to his orders.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Grave <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> need great care in their cure. Hence the imposition of a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> penance, which is only applied for the most grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, is reserved to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.
