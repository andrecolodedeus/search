<h1>Question 28. The virginity of the Mother of God</h1>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the Mother of God was a virgin in conceiving Christ?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> was not a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> in conceiving <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For no child having father and mother is conceived by a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> mother. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is said to have had not only a mother, but also a father, according to <a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse33">Luke 2:33</a>: "His father and mother were wondering at those things which were spoken concerning Him": and further on (<a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse48">Luke 2:48</a>) in the same chapter she says: "Behold I and Thy father [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Thy father and I'] have sought Thee sorrowing." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not conceived of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> mother.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further (<a href="../bible/mat001.htm">Matthew 1</a>) it is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was the Son of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and David, through <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> being descended from David. But this <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> would have availed nothing if <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> were not the father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Mother conceived Him of the seed of <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>; and consequently that she was not a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> in conceiving Him.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse4">Galatians 4:4</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>." But according to the customary mode of speaking, the term "<a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>" applies to one who is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of a man. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not conceived by a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> mother.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, things of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> have the same mode of generation: since generation is specified by its terminus just as are other motions. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> belonged to the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> as other men, according to <a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse7">Philippians 2:7</a>: "Being made in the likeness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> found as a man." Since therefore other men are begotten of the mingling of male and female, it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was begotten in the same manner; and that consequently He was not conceived of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> mother.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> form has its determinate <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, outside which it cannot be. But the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> form appears to be the semen of male and female. If therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was not conceived of the semen of male and female, it would not have been <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body; which cannot be asserted. It seems therefore that He was not conceived of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> mother.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/isa007.htm#verse14">Isaiah 7:14</a>): "Behold a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> shall conceive."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We must confess simply that the Mother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> in conceiving for to deny this belongs to the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the Ebionites and Cerinthus, who held <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be a mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and maintained that He was born of both sexes.

<p>It is fitting for four reasons that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should be born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. First, in order to maintain the dignity or the Father Who sent Him. For since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, it was not fitting that He should have another father than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: lest the dignity belonging to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be transferred to another.

<p>Secondly, this was befitting to a property of the Son Himself, Who is sent. For He is the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>: and the word is conceived without any interior corruption: indeed, interior corruption is incompatible with perfect conception of the word. Since therefore flesh was so assumed by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, as to be the flesh of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, it was fitting that it also should be conceived without corruption of the mother.

<p>Thirdly, this was befitting to the dignity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> humanity in which there could be no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, since by it the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the world was taken away, according to <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse29">John 1:29</a>: "Behold the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (i.e. the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a> without stain) "who taketh away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the world." Now it was not possible in a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> already corrupt, for flesh to be born from sexual intercourse without incurring the infection of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. Whence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Nup. et Concup. i): "In that union," viz. the marriage of Mary and <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>, "the nuptial intercourse alone was lacking: because in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> flesh this could not be without fleshly <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> which arises from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and without which He wished to be conceived, Who was to be without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>."

<p>Fourthly, on account of the very end of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which was that men might be born again as sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, "not of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the flesh, nor of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse13">John 1:13</a>), i.e. of the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of which fact the very conception of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was to appear as an exemplar. Whence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Sanct. Virg.): "It behooved that our Head, by a notable <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, should be born, after the flesh, of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, that He might thereby signify that His members would be born, after the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> Church."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> says on <a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse33">Luke 1:33</a>: <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> is called the father of the Saviour, not that he really was His father, as the Photinians pretended: but that he was considered by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to be so, for the safeguarding of Mary's <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">good name</a>. Wherefore Luke adds (<a href="../bible/luk003.htm#verse23">Luke 3:23</a>): "Being, as it was supposed, the son of <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>."

<p>Or, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Cons. Evang. ii), <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> is called the father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> just as "he is called the husband of Mary, without fleshly mingling, by the mere bond of marriage: being thereby united to Him much more closely than if he were adopted from another <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. Consequently that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not begotten of <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> by fleshly union is no reason why <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> should not be called His father; since he would be the father even of an adopted son not born of his wife."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on <a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse18">Matthew 1:18</a>: "Though <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> was not the father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> and Saviour, the order of His genealogy is traced down to <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>"--first, because "the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> are not wont to trace the female line in genealogies": secondly, "Mary and <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> were of the same tribe"; wherefore by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> he was bound to take her as being of his kin. Likewise, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Nup. et Concup. i), "it was befitting to trace the genealogy down to <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>, lest in that marriage any slight should be offered to the male sex, which is indeed the stronger: for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> suffered nothing thereby, since both <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> and Mary were of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of David."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says on this passage, the word "'mulier,' is here used instead of 'femina,' according to the custom of the Hebrew tongue: which applies the term signifying <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to those of the female sex who are <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> This argument is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of those things which come into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> by the way of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: since <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, just as it is fixed to one particular effect, so it is determinate to one mode of producing that effect. But as the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> extends to the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>: just as it is not determinate to one effect, so neither is it determinate to one mode of producing any effect whatever. Consequently, just as it was possible for the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be produced, by the Divine power, "from the slime of the earth," so too was it possible for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body to be made, by Divine power, from a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> without the seed of the male.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Gener. Animal. i, ii, iv), in conception the seed of the male is not by way of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but by way of agent: and the female alone supplies the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Wherefore though the seed of the male was lacking in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> conception, it does not follow that due <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> was lacking.

<p>But if the seed of the male were the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the fetus in animal conception, it is nevertheless manifest that it is not a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> remaining under one form, but subject to transformation. And though the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power cannot transmute other than determinate <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to a determinate form; nevertheless the Divine power, which is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, can transmute all <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to any form whatsoever. Consequently, just as it transmuted the slime of the earth into <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam's</a> body, so could it transmute the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> supplied by His Mother into <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, even though it were not the sufficient <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> for a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> conception.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether Christ's Mother was a virgin in His birth?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Mother was not a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> in His Birth. For <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says on <a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse23">Luke 2:23</a>: "He who sanctified a strange womb, for the birth of a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, He it is who opened His Mother's womb, that He might go forth unspotted." But opening of the womb excludes <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. Therefore Christ's Mother was not a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> in His Birth.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, nothing should have taken place in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which would make His body to seem unreal. Now it seems to pertain not to a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> but to an unreal body, to be able to go through a closed passage; since two bodies cannot be in one place at the same time. It was therefore unfitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body should come forth from His Mother's closed womb: and consequently that she should remain a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> in giving birth to Him.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says in the Homily for the octave of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> [xxvi in Evang., that by entering after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> where the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were gathered, the doors being shut, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> "showed that His body was the same in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> but differed in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>": so that it seems that to go through a closed passage pertains to a glorified body. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was not glorified in its conception, but was passible, having "the likeness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> flesh," as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse3">Romans 8:3</a>). Therefore He did not come forth through the closed womb of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> In a sermon of the Council of Ephesus (P. III, Cap. ix) it is said: "After giving birth, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>: but <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> enhances her fruitfulness, and effects her motherhood, while in no way does it injure her <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>." Therefore Christ's Mother was a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> also in giving birth to Him.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Without any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> whatever we must assert that the Mother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> even in His Birth: for the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says not only: "Behold a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> shall conceive," but adds: "and shall bear a son." This indeed was befitting for three reasons. First, because this was in keeping with a property of Him whose Birth is in question, for He is the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>. For the word is not only conceived in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> without corruption, but also proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> without corruption. Wherefore in order to show that body to be the body of the very <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, it was fitting that it should be born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> incorrupt. Whence in the sermon of the Council of Ephesus (quoted above) we read: "Whosoever brings forth mere flesh, ceases to be a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. But since she gave birth to the Word made flesh, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> safeguarded her <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> so as to manifest His Word, by which Word He thus manifested Himself: for neither does our word, when brought forth, corrupt the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>; nor does <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> Word, deigning to be born, destroy <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>."

<p>Secondly, this is fitting as regards the effect of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>: since He came for this purpose, that He might take away our corruption. Wherefore it is unfitting that in His Birth He should corrupt His Mother's <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. Thus <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a sermon on the Nativity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>: "It was not right that He who came to heal corruption, should by His advent violate integrity."

<p>Thirdly, it was fitting that He Who commanded us to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> our father and mother should not in His Birth lessen the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> due to His Mother.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says this in expounding the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist's</a> quotation from the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>: "Every male opening the womb shall be called <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> to the Lord." This, says <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>, "is said in regard to the wonted manner of birth; not that we are to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> in coming forth violated the abode of her sacred womb, which His entrance therein had hallowed." Wherefore the opening here spoken of does not imply the unlocking of the enclosure of virginal purity; but the mere coming forth of the infant from the maternal womb.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> wished so to show the reality of His body, as to manifest His Godhead at the same time. For this reason He mingled wondrous with lowly things. Wherefore, to show that His body was real, He was born of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. But in order to manifest His Godhead, He was born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, for "such a Birth befits a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," as <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says in the Christmas <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Some have held that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in His Birth, assumed the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of "subtlety," when He came forth from the closed womb of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>; and that He assumed the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of "agility" when with dry feet He walked on the sea. But this is not consistent with what has been decided above (<a href="#14">Article 14</a>). For these <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of a glorified body result from an overflow of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> on to the body, as we shall explain further on, in treating of glorified bodies (XP, 82): and it has been said above (13, 3, ad 1; 16, 1, ad 2) that before His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> Christ "allowed His flesh to do and to suffer what was proper to it" (Damascene, De Fide Orth. iii): nor was there such an overflow of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> from His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> on to His body.

<p>We must therefore say that all these things took place <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> by Divine power. Whence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Sup. Joan. Tract. 121): "To the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of a body in which was the Godhead closed doors were no obstacle. For <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> He had power to enter in by doors not open, in Whose Birth His Mother's <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> remained inviolate." And <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says in an epistle (Ad Caium iv) that "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> excelled <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in doing that which is proper to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: this is shown in His <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> conception, of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, and in the unstable waters bearing the weight of earthly feet."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether Christ's Mother remained a virgin after His birth?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Mother did not remain a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> after His Birth. For it is written (<a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse18">Matthew 1:18</a>): "Before <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> and Mary came together, she was found with child of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." Now the Evangelist would not have said this--"before they came together"--unless he were certain of their subsequent coming together; for no one says of one who does not eventually dine "before he dines" (cf. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, Contra Helvid.). It seems, therefore, that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> subsequently had intercourse with <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>; and consequently that she did not remain a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> after (Christ's) Birth.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in the same passage (<a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse20">Matthew 1:20</a>) are related the words of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>: "Fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife." But marriage is consummated by carnal intercourse. Therefore it seems that this must have at some time taken place between Mary and <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>: and that, consequently she did not remain a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> after (Christ's) Birth.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, again in the same passage a little further on (<a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse24">Matthew 1:24-25</a>) we read: "And" (<a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>) "took unto him his wife; and he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> her not till she brought forth her <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> Son." Now this conjunction "till" is wont to designate a fixed time, on the completion of which that takes place which previously had not taken place. And the verb "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>" refers here to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by intercourse (cf. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, Contra Helvid.); just as (<a href="../bible/gen004.htm#verse1">Genesis 4:1</a>) it is said that "<a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> his wife." Therefore it seems that after (Christ's) Birth, the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>; and, consequently, that she did not remain a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> after the Birth (of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>).

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, "<a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a>" can only be said of one who has brothers afterwards: wherefore (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse29">Romans 8:29</a>): "Whom He foreknew, He also <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to be made conformable to the image of His Son; that He might be the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> among many brethren." But the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> calls <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> by His Mother. Therefore she had other children after <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Mother did not remain a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> after His Birth.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/joh002.htm#verse12">John 2:12</a>): "After this He went down to Capharnaum, He"--that is, Christ--"and His Mother and His brethren." But brethren are those who are begotten of the same parent. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> had other sons after <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse55">Matthew 27:55-56</a>): "There were there"--that is, by the cross of Christ--"many <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> afar off, who had followed <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> from <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, ministering unto Him; among whom was <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Mary Magdalen</a>, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee." Now this Mary who is called "the mother of James and Joseph" seems to have been also the Mother of Christ; for it is written (<a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse25">John 19:25</a>) that "there stood by the cross of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, Mary His Mother." Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Mother did not remain a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> after His Birth.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/eze044.htm#verse2">Ezekiel 44:2</a>): "This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall pass through it; because the Lord the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> hath entered in by it." Expounding these words, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a sermon (De Annunt. Dom. iii): "What means this closed gate in the House of the Lord, except that Mary is to be ever inviolate? What does it mean that 'no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall pass through it,' save that <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> shall not know her? And what is this--'The Lord alone enters in and goeth out by it'--except that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> shall impregnate her, and that the Lord of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> shall be born of her? And what means this--'it shall be shut for evermore'--but that Mary is a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> before His Birth, a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> in His Birth, and a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> after His Birth?"

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Without any hesitation we must abhor the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of Helvidius, who dared to assert that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Mother, after His Birth, was carnally <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>, and bore other children. For, in the first place, this is derogatory to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> perfection: for as He is in His Godhead the Only-Begotten of the Father, being thus His Son in every respect perfect, so it was becoming that He should be the Only-begotten son of His Mother, as being her perfect offspring.

<p>Secondly, this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is an insult to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, whose "shrine" was the virginal womb ["Sacrarium Spiritus Sancti" (Office of B. M. V., Ant. ad Benedictus, T. P.), wherein He had formed the flesh of Christ: wherefore it was unbecoming that it should be desecrated by intercourse with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p>Thirdly, this is derogatory to the dignity and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> Mother: for thus she would seem to be most ungrateful, were she not content with such a Son; and were she, of her own accord, by carnal intercourse to forfeit that <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> which had been <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> preserved in her.

<p>Fourthly, it would be tantamount to an imputation of extreme presumption in <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>, to assume that he attempted to violate her whom by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> to have conceived by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p>We must therefore simply assert that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, as she was a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> in conceiving Him and a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> in giving Him birth, did she remain a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> ever afterwards.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (Contra Helvid. i): "Although this particle 'before' often indicates a subsequent event, yet we must observe that it not infrequently points merely to some thing previously in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>: nor is there need that what was in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> take place eventually, since something may occur to prevent its happening. Thus if a man say: 'Before I dined in the port, I set sail,' we do not understand him to have dined in port after he set sail: but that his mind was set on dining in port." In like manner the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> says: "Before they came together" Mary "was found with child, of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>," not that they came together afterwards: but that, when it seemed that they would come together, this was forestalled through her conceiving by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, the result being that afterwards they did not come together.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Nup. et Concup. i): "The <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> is called (<a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph's</a>) wife from the first promise of her espousals, whom he had not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> nor ever was to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by carnal intercourse." For, as <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says on <a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse27">Luke 1:27</a>: "The fact of her marriage is declared, not to insinuate the loss of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, but to witness to the reality of the union."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Some have said that this is not to be understood of carnal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but of acquaintance. Thus <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says [Opus Imperf. in Matth., Hom. 1: among the spurious works ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>] that "<a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> did not know her, until she gave birth, being unaware of her dignity: but after she had given birth, then did he know her. Because by reason of her child she surpassed the whole world in beauty and dignity: since she alone in the narrow abode of her womb received Him Whom the world cannot contain."

<p>Others again refer this to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by sight. For as, while <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was speaking with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, his face was so bright "that the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> could not steadfastly behold it"; so Mary, while being "overshadowed" by the brightness of the "power of the Most High," could not be gazed on by <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>, until she gave birth. But afterwards she is acknowledged by <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>, by looking on her face, not by <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lustful</a> contact.

<p> <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, however, grants that this is to be understood of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by intercourse; but he observes that "before" or "until" has a twofold sense in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>. For sometimes it indicates a fixed time, as <a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse19">Galatians 3:19</a>: The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> "was set because of transgressions, until the seed should come, to whom He made the promise." On the other hand, it sometimes indicates an indefinite time, as in <a href="../bible/psa122.htm#verse2">Psalm 122:2</a>: "Our eyes are unto the Lord our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, until He have mercy on us"; from which it is not to be gathered that our eyes are turned from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as soon as His mercy has been obtained. In this sense those things are indicated "of which we might <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> if they had not been written down: while others are left out to be supplied by our understanding. Thus the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> says that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> was not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by her husband until she gave birth, that we may be given to understand that still less did he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> her afterwards" (Adversus Helvid. v).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> are wont to designate as the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a>, not only a child who is followed by others, but also the one that is born first. "Otherwise, if a child were not <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> unless followed by others, the first-fruits would not be due as long as there was no further produce" [ <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, Adversus Helvid. x]: which is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, since according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> the first-fruits had to be redeemed within a month (<a href="../bible/num018.htm#verse16">Numbers 18:16</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Some, as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on <a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse49">Matthew 12:49-50</a>, "suppose that the brethren of the Lord were <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph's</a> sons by another wife. But we understand the brethren of the Lord to be not sons of <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>, but cousins of the Saviour, the sons of Mary, His Mother's sister." For "<a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> speaks of brethren in four senses; namely, those who are united by being of the same parents, of the same nation, of the same <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, by common affection." Wherefore the brethren of the Lord are so called, not by birth, as being born of the same mother; but by relationship, as being blood-relations of His. But <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (Contra Helvid. ix), is rather to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to have remained a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, "since he is not said to have had another wife," and "a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not live otherwise than chastely."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> Mary who is called "the mother of James and Joseph" is not to be taken for the Mother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>, who is not wont to be named in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> save under this designation of her dignity--"the Mother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>." This Mary is to be taken for the wife of Alphaeus, whose son was James the less, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as the "<a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brother of the Lord</a>" (<a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse19">Galatians 1:19</a>).

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the Mother of God took a vow of virginity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> did not take a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/deu007.htm#verse14">Deuteronomy 7:14</a>): "No one shall be barren among you of either sex." But sterility is a consequence of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. Therefore the keeping of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> was contrary to the commandment of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. But before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was born the old <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was still in force. Therefore at that time the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> could not lawfully take a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse25">1 Corinthians 7:25</a>): "Concerning <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> I have no commandment of the Lord; but I give counsel." But the perfection of the counsels was to take its beginning from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who is the "end of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>," as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse4">Romans 10:4</a>). It was not therefore becoming that the Virgin should take a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on <a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse12">1 Timothy 5:12</a>, that "for those who are vowed to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, it is reprehensible not only to marry, but also to desire to be <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a>." But the Mother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> committed no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for which she could be reprehended, as stated above (Question 27, Article 4). Since therefore she was "espoused," as related by <a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse27">Luke 1:27</a> it seems that she did not take a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Sanct. Virg. iv): "Mary answered the announcing <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>: 'How shall this be done, because I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>?' She would not have said this unless she had already vowed her <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As we have stated in the II-II, 88, 6, works of perfection are more praiseworthy when performed in fulfilment of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. Now it is clear that for reasons already given (1,2,3) <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> had a special place in the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>. It was therefore fitting that her <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> should be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. Nevertheless because, while the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> was in force both men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> were bound to attend to the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of begetting, since the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was spread according to carnal origin, until <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was born of that people; the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> is not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to have taken an absolute <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, before being espoused to <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>, although she desired to do so, yet yielding her own will to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> judgment. Afterwards, however, having taken a husband, according as the custom of the time required, together with him she took a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Because it seemed to be forbidden by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> not to take the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> steps for leaving a posterity on earth, therefore the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> did not <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> absolutely, but under the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> that it were pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. When, however, she <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that it was acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, she made the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> absolute, before the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> <a href="../cathen/01541c.htm">Annunciation</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as the fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> perfectly, yet some beginning of the fulness preceded in His Mother; so also the observance of the counsels, which is an effect of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, began its perfection in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but was begun after a fashion in His Virgin Mother.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> These words of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> are to be understood of those who <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> absolutely. Christ's Mother did not do this until she was espoused to Joseph. After her espousals, however, by their common consent she took a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> together with her spouse.
