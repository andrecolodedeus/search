<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether Extreme Unction is a sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. For just as oil is used on sick people, so is it on catechumens. But anointing of catechumens with oil is not a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Therefore neither is the <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> of the sick with oil.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> were figures of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>. But there was no figure of <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. Therefore it is not a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Eccl. Hier. iii, v) every sacrament aims at either cleansing, or enlightening, or perfecting. Now <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> does not aim at either cleansing, or enlightening, for this is ascribed to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> alone, or perfecting, for according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Eccl. Hier. ii), this belongs to Confirmation and the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> supply <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> defects sufficiently with respect to every state of life. Now no other than <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> does this for those who are departing from this life. Therefore it is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p>Further, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are neither more nor less than <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> remedies. Now <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> remedy, since it avails for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, according to <a href="../bible/jam005.htm#verse15">James 5:15</a>. Therefore it is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Among the visible operations of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, some are <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, some are <a href="../cathen/13292d.htm">sacramentals</a>, as Exorcism. The difference between these is that a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is an action of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that reaches to the principal effect intended in the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, whereas a sacramental is an action which, though it does not reach to that effect, is nevertheless directed towards that principal action. Now the effect intended in the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> is the healing of the disease of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/isa027.htm#verse9">Isaiah 27:9</a>): "This is all the fruit, that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> . . . should be taken away." Since then <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> reaches to this effect, as is clear from the words of James, and is not ordained to any other sacrament as an accessory thereto, it is evident that <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> is not a sacramental but a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The oil with which catechumens are anointed does not convey the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to them by its unction, for that belongs to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. It does, however, dispose them to receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, as stated above (III, 71, 3). Hence that unction is not a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> as <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> is.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This sacrament prepares <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> immediately, since it is given to those who are departing from this life. And as, under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, it was not yet time to enter into <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, because "the Law brought nobody [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'nothing'] to perfection" (<a href="../bible/heb007.htm#verse19">Hebrews 7:19</a>), so this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> had not to be foreshadowed therein by some corresponding sacrament, as by a figure of the same kind. Nevertheless it was somewhat foreshadowed remotely by all the healings related in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> makes no mention of <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a>, as neither of Penance, nor of Matrimony, because he had no <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> to decide any question about the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, save in so far as they serve to illustrate the orderly disposition of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical hierarchy</a>, as regards the ministers, their actions, and the recipients. Nevertheless since <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> confers <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that it possesses an enlightening and cleansing power, even as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, though not so copious.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether Extreme Unction is one sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> is not one sacrament. Because the oneness of a thing depends on its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, since being and oneness are derived from the same source. Now the form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is said several times during the one administration, and the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is applied to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> anointed in respect of various parts of his body. Therefore it is not one sacrament.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the unction itself is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, for it would be absurd to say that the oil is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. But there are several unctions. Therefore there are several <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, one sacrament should be performed by one minister. But the case might occur that <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> could not be conferred by one minister: thus if the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> die after the first unction, another <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> would have to proceed with the others. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> is not one sacrament.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> As immersion is in relation to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, so is unction to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. But several immersions are but one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a>. Therefore the several unctions in <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> are also one sacrament.

<p>Further, if it were not one sacrament, then after the first unction, it would not be <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> for the perfection of the sacrament that the second unction should be performed, since each sacrament has perfect being of itself. But that is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Therefore it is one sacrament.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Strictly speaking, a thing is one numerically in three ways. First, as something indivisible, which is neither actually nor <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a> several--as a point, and unity. Secondly, as something continuous, which is actually one, but <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a> several--as a line. Thirdly, as something complete, that is composed of several parts--as a house, which is, in a way, several things, even actually, although those several things go together towards making one. In this way each sacrament is said to be one thing, in as much as the many things which are contained in one sacrament, are united together for the purpose of signifying or <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> one thing, because a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is a sign of the effect it produces. Hence when one action suffices for a perfect signification, the unity of the sacrament consists in that action only, as may be seen in Confirmation. When, however, the signification of the sacrament can be both in one and in several actions, then the sacrament can be complete both in one and in several actions, even as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> in one immersion and in three, since washing which is signified in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, can be completed by one immersion and by several. But when the perfect signification cannot be expressed except by means of several actions, then these several actions are <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> for the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as is exemplified in the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, for the refreshment of the body which signifies that of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, can only be attained by means of meat and drink. It is the same in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, because the healing of the internal wounds cannot be perfectly signified save by the application of the remedy to the various sources of the wounds. Hence several actions are <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the perfection of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The unity of a complete whole is not destroyed by reason of a diversity of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> or form in the parts of that whole. Thus it is evident that there is neither the same <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> nor the same form in the flesh and in the bones of which one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is composed. In like manner too, in the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, and in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, the diversity of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> does not destroy the unity of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although those actions are several simply, yet they are united together in one complete action, viz. the anointing of all the external senses, whence arises the infernal malady.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although, in the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, if the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> die after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the bread, another <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> can go on with the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the wine, beginning where the other left off, or can begin over again with fresh <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, in <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> he cannot begin over again, but should always go on, because to anoint the same part a second time would produce as much effect as if one were to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> a host a second time, which ought by no means to be done. Nor does the plurality of ministers destroy the unity of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, because they only act as instruments, and the unity of a smith's work is not destroyed by his using several hammers.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether this sacrament was instituted by Christ?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> was not instituted by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For mention is made in the Gospel of the institution of those <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> instituted, for instance the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. But no mention is made of <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a>. Therefore it was not instituted by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> says explicitly (Sent. iv, D, 23) that it was instituted by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not institute it Himself.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> showed forth the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which He instituted, as in the case of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. But He did not bestow this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> on anyone. Therefore He did not institute it Himself.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> are more excellent than those of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. But all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> were instituted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore much more do all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> owe their institution to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself.

<p>Further, to make an institution and to remove it belongs to the same authority. Now the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who enjoys the same authority in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">successors of the apostles</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> themselves possessed, cannot do away with the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> did not institute it, but <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There are two opinions on this point. For some hold that this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> and Confirmation were not instituted by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself, but were left by Him to be instituted by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; for the reason that these two <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, on account of the plenitude of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> conferred in them, could not be instituted before the mission of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> in perfect plenitude. Hence they are <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> in such a way as not to be foreshadowed in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. But this argument is not very cogent, since, just as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, before His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, promised the mission of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> in His plenitude, so could He institute these <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p>Wherefore others hold that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself instituted all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, but that He Himself published some, which present greater difficulty to our <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, while he reserved some to be published by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, such as <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> and Confirmation. This opinion seems so much the more probable, as the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> belong to the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, wherefore their institution pertains to the lawgiver; besides, they derive their efficacy from their institution, which efficacy is given them by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> did and said many things which are not related in the Gospel. For the evangelists were intent on handing down chiefly those things that were <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> or concerned the building of the ecclesiastical edifice. Hence they related the institution by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, Penance, the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> and orders, rather than of <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> and Confirmation, which are not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, nor do they concern the building or division of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. As a matter of fact however an anointing done by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> is mentioned in the Gospel (<a href="../bible/mar006.htm#verse13">Mark 6:13</a>) where it is said that they "anointed the sick with oil."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> says it was instituted by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> because its institution was made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us by the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not show forth any sacrament except such as He received by way of example: but He could not be a recipient of Penance and <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a>, since there was no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in Him: hence He did not show them forth.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether olive oil is a suitable matter for this sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that olive oil is not a suitable <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> for this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. For this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is ordained immediately to the state of incorruption. Now incorruption is signified by balsam which is contained in <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>. Therefore chrism would be a more suitable <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> for this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> healing. Now <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> healing is signified by the use of wine, as may be gathered from the parable of the wounded <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> (<a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse34">Luke 10:34</a>). Therefore wine also would be more suitable a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> for this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, where there is the greater danger, the remedy should be a common one. But olive oil is not a common remedy, since the olive is not found in every country. Therefore, since this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is given to the dying, who are in the greatest danger, it seems that olive oil is not a suitable <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> oil is appointed (<a href="../bible/jam005.htm#verse14">James 5:14</a>) as the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Now, properly speaking, oil is none but olive oil. Therefore this is the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> healing is signified by anointing with oil, as is evident from <a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse6">Isaiah 1:6</a> where we read: " . . . swelling sores: they are not . . . dressed nor fomented with oil." Therefore the suitable <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> for this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is oil.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> healing, which is given at the end of life, ought to be complete, since there is no other to follow; it ought also to be gentle, lest hope, of which the dying stand in utmost need, be shattered rather than fostered. Now oil has a softening effect, it penetrates to the very heart of a thing, and spreads over it. Hence, in both the foregoing respects, it is a suitable <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> for this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. And since oil is, above all, the name of the liquid extract of olives, for other liquids are only called oil from their likeness to it, it follows that olive oil is the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> which should be employed in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The incorruption of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is something not contained in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>: and there is no need for the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to signify such a thing. Hence it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for balsam to be included in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, because on account of its fragrance it is indicative of a <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">good name</a>, which is no longer <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, for its own sake, to those who are dying; they need only a clear <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> which is signified by oil.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Wine heals by its roughness, oil by its softness, wherefore healing with wine pertains to Penance rather than to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Though olive oil is not produced everywhere, yet it can easily be transported from one place to another. Moreover this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is not so <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the dying cannot obtain <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> without it.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the oil ought to be consecrated?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the oil need not be consecrated. Because there is a sanctification in the use of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, through the form of words. Therefore another sanctification is superfluous if it be applied to the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the efficacy and signification of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are in their very <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But the signification of the effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, is suitable to oil on account of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> properties, and the efficacy thereof is due to the Divine institution. Therefore its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> does not need to be sanctified.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is a more perfect sacrament than <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a>. But, so far as the essentials of the sacrament are concerned, the baptismal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> needs no sanctification. Neither therefore does the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> need to be sanctified.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> In all other anointings the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is previously <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>. Therefore since this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is an anointing, it requires <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some hold that mere oil is the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, and that the sacrament itself is perfected in the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the oil by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. But this is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> since we <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> when treating of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> that that sacrament alone consists in the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> (2, 1, ad 2).

<p>We must therefore say that this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> consists in the anointing itself, just as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> consists in the washing, and that the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> oil. Three reasons may be assigned why <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is needed in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> and in certain others. The first is that all sacramental efficacy is derived from Christ: wherefore those <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which He Himself used, derived their efficacy from His use of them, even as, by the contact of His flesh, He bestowed the force of regeneration on the waters. But He did not use this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, nor any bodily anointing, wherefore in all anointings a <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is required. The second reason is that this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> confers a plenitude of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, so as to take away not only <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> but also the remnants of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and bodily sickness. The third reason is that its effect on the body, viz. bodily health, is not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> property of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. wherefore it has to derive this efficacy from being <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The first <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> sanctifies the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in itself, but the second regards rather the use of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> considered as actually producing its effect. Hence neither is superfluous, because instruments also receive their efficacy from the craftsman, both when they are made, and when they are used for action.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The efficacy which the sacrament derives from its institution, is applied to this particular <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> when it is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>. The Reply to the Third Objection is gathered from what has been said.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the matter of this sacrament need be consecrated by a bishop?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> need not be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Because the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the Eucharistic elements surpasses that of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. But a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> can <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>. Therefore he can do so in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> also.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in material works the higher art never prepares the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> for the lower, because the art which applies the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is more excellent than that which prepares it, as stated in Phys. ii, text. 25. Now a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is above a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Therefore he does not prepare the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> which is applied by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. But a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> dispenses this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as we shall state further on (31). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> does not belong to a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> In other anointings also the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Therefore the same applies to this.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The minister of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> produces the effect, not by his own power, as though he were the principal agent, but by the efficacy of the sacrament which he dispenses. This efficacy comes, in the first place, from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and from Him flows down to others in due order, viz. to the people through the medium of the ministers who dispense the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and to the lower ministers through the medium of the higher ministers who sanctify the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Wherefore, in all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which require a sanctified <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, the first <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is performed by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and the application thereof sometimes by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, in order to show that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> power is derived from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa132.htm#verse2">Psalm 132:2</a>: "Like the precious ointment on the head," i.e. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, "that ran down upon the beard of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>" first, and then "to the skirt of his garment."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> consists in the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and not in its use. Consequently, strictly speaking, that which is the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the sacrament is not a <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> thing. Hence no <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is required beforehand: but the altar and such like things, even the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> himself, need to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, all of which can be done by none but a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>: so that in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> also, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> power is shown to be derived from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> observes (Eccl. Hier. iii). The reason why a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> can perform that <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> which is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> by itself, and not that which, as a sacramental, is directed to a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> consisting in something used by the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, is that in respect of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body no order is above the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, whereas, in respect of <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">Christ's mystic body</a> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopate</a> is above the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, as we shall state further on (40, 4).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The sacramental <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is not one that is made into something else by him that uses it, as occurs in the mechanical arts: it is one, in virtue of which something is done, so that it partakes somewhat of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, in so far as it is the instrument of a Divine operation. Hence the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> needs to acquire this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> from a higher art or power, since among efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, the more prior the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the more perfect it is, whereas in material <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, the more prior the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, the more imperfect it is.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether this sacrament has a form?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> has no form. Because, since the efficacy of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> is derived from their institution, as also from their form, the latter must needs be appointed by the institutor of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. But there is no account of the form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> being instituted either by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> or by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. Therefore this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> has no form.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is observed everywhere in the same way. Now nothing is so <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> that has a form, as that very form. Therefore, as in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> there is no form commonly used by all, since various words are in use, it seems that this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> has no form.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> no form is needed except for the sanctification of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, because the water is "sanctified by the word of life so as to wash <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> away," as Hugh states (De Sacram. ii). Now the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is already <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>. Therefore it needs no form of words.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> says (Sent. iv, D, 1) that every sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> consists in things and words. Now the words are the sacramental form. Therefore, since this is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, it seems that it has a form.

<p>Further, this is confirmed by the rite of the Universal Church, who uses certain words in the bestowal of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some have held that no form is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. This, however, seems derogatory to the effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, since every sacrament signifies its effect. Now the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is indifferent as regards its effect, and consequently cannot be determined to any particular effect save by the form of words. Hence in all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, since they effect what they signify, there must needs be things and words. Moreover <a href="../cathen/08275b.htm">James</a> (<a href="../bible/jam005.htm#verse14">5:14-15</a>) seems to ascribe the whole force of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, which is the form thereof, as we shall state further on (ad 2: 8,9). Wherefore the foregoing opinion seems presumptuous and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>; and for that reason we should hold with the common opinion that this, like all the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, has a fixed form.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> is proposed to all alike: and so, the form of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, which can be conferred by all, should be expressed in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>, as also the form of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, which in regard to that sacrament, expresses <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Now the forms of the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are not contained in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>, but were handed down to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, who received them from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> declares (<a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse23">1 Corinthians 11:23</a>): "For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered to you," etc.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The words which are <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the form, viz. the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of deprecation, are said by all; but other words which pertain to the well-being thereof, are not said by all.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> has a certain sanctification of its own from the very contact of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour's</a> flesh; but the form of words sanctifies it so that it has a sanctifying force. In like manner when the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> has been sanctified in itself, it requires sanctification in its use, so that it may sanctify actually.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether the form of this sacrament should be expressed by way of assertion or of petition?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> should be expressed by way of assertion rather than of petition. Because all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> have a sure effect. But sureness of effect is not expressed in the sacramental forms except by way of assertion, as when we say: "This is My body" or "I <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> thee." Therefore the form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> should be expressed as an assertion.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the minister should be expressed in the sacramental forms because it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of conferring a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is not expressed except by an assertion. Therefore, etc.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in some churches the following words are said in the conferring of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>: "I anoint these eyes with <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> oil in the name of the Father," etc., which is in keeping with the forms of the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Therefore it seems that such is the form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The form of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> must needs be one that is observed everywhere. Now the words employed according to the custom of all the churches are not those quoted above, but take the form of a petition viz.: "Through this <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">holy unction</a>, and His most tender mercy, may the Lord pardon thee whatever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> thou hast committed, by sight," etc. Therefore the form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is expressed as a petition.

<p>Further, this seems to follow from the words of James, who ascribes the effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>," says he (<a href="../bible/jam005.htm#verse15">5:15</a>), "shall save the sick <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." Since then a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> takes its efficacy from its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, it seems that the form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is expressed as a petition.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is expressed by way of a petition, as appears from the words of James, and from the custom of the Roman Church, who uses no other than words of supplication in conferring this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Several reasons are assigned for this: first, because the recipient of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is deprived of his strength, so that he needs to be helped by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>; secondly, because it is given to the dying, who are on the point of quitting the courts of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and rest in the hands of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, for which reason they are committed to Him by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; thirdly, because the effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is not such that it always results from the minister's <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, even when all essentials have been duly observed, as is the case with the character in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> and Confirmation, transubstantiation in the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in Penance (given <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>) which remission is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a> but not to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Consequently the form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> cannot be expressed in the indicative mood, as in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> just mentioned.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This sacrament, like the others mentioned, considered in itself, is sure of its effect. yet this effect can be hindered through the insincerity of the recipient (though by his <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> he submit to the sacrament), so that he receives no effect at all. Hence there is no parity between this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, and the others wherein some effect always ensues.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is sufficiently expressed by the act which is mentioned in the form, viz.: "By this <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">holy unction</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> These words in the indicative mood, which some are wont to say before the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, are not the sacramental form, but are a preparation for the form, in so far as they determine the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the minister.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether the foregoing prayer is a suitable form for this sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the foregoing <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is not a suitable form for this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. For in the forms of the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> mention is made of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, for instance in Confirmation, whereas this is not done in the aforesaid words. Therefore it is not a suitable form.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as the effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is bestowed on us by the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so are the effects of the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. But mention is made in the forms of the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, not of the Divine mercy, but rather of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. Therefore the same should be done here.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 23) to have a twofold effect. But in the foregoing words mention is made of only one effect, viz. the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and not of the healing of the body to which end James directs the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to be made (<a href="../bible/jam005.htm#verse15">James 5:15</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> shall save the sick <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." Therefore the above form is unsuitable.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> given above (<a href="#8">Article 8</a>) is a suitable form for this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, for it includes the sacrament by the words: "By this <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">holy unction</a>," and that which works in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, viz. "the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," and the effect, viz. "remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> may be understood in the act of anointing, whereas the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of Confirmation cannot be implied by the act expressed in the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Hence there is no parity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The object of mercy is misery: and because this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is given when we are in a state of misery, i.e. of sickness, mention of mercy is made in this rather than in other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The form should contain mention of the principal effect, and of that which always ensues in virtue of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, unless there be something lacking on the part of the recipient. Now bodily health is not an effect of this kind, as we shall state further on (30, 1 ,2), though it does ensue at times, for which reason James ascribes this effect to the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> which is the form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.
