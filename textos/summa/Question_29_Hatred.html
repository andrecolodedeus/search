<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether evil is the cause and object of hatred?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not the object and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. For everything that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>, as such, is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. If therefore <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> be the object of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, it follows that nothing but the lack of something can be the object of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>: which is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is praise-worthy; hence (<a href="../bible/2ma003.htm#verse1">2 Maccabees 3:1</a>) some are praised for that "the laws were very well kept, because of the godliness of Onias the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>'] had no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." If, therefore, nothing but <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> be the object of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, it would follow that all <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is commendable: and this is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the same thing is not at the same time both <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But the same thing is lovable and hateful to different subjects. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is not only of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but also of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Hatred is the opposite of love. But the object of love is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as stated above (26, 1; 27, 1). Therefore the object of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is the result of apprehension (though this apprehension is not in the same subject as the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>), it seems that what applies to the inclination of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, applies also to the animal <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, which does result from an apprehension in the same subject, as stated above (Question 26, Article 1). Now, with regard to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, it is evident, that just as each thing is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> attuned and adapted to that which is suitable to it, wherein consists <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love; so has it a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> dissonance from that which opposes and destroys it; and this is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. So, therefore, in the animal <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, or in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, love is a certain harmony of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> with that which is apprehended as suitable; while <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is dissonance of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> from that which is apprehended as repugnant and hurtful. Now, just as whatever is suitable, as such, bears the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; so whatever is repugnant, as such, bears the aspect of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And therefore, just as <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is the object of love, so <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is the object of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Being, as such, has not the aspect of repugnance but only of fittingness; because being is common to all things. But being, inasmuch as it is this determinate being, has an aspect of repugnance to some determinate being. And in this way, one being is hateful to another, and is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; though not in itself, but by comparison with something else.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as a thing may be apprehended as <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, when it is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; so a thing may be apprehended as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, whereas it is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Hence it happens sometimes that neither <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> nor love of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> To different things the same thing may be lovable or hateful: in respect of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, owing to one and the same thing being <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> suitable to one thing, and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> unsuitable to another: thus heat is becoming to fire and unbecoming to water: and in respect of the animal <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, owing to one and the same thing being apprehended by one as <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, by another as bad.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether love is a cause of hatred?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that love is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. For "the opposite members of a division are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> simultaneous" (Praedic. x). But love and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> are opposite members of a division, since they are contrary to one another. Therefore they are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> simultaneous. Therefore love is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, of two contraries, one is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the other. But love and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> are contraries. Therefore love is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that which follows is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of that which precedes. But <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> precedes love, seemingly: since <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> implies a turning away from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, whereas love implies a turning towards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore love is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 7,9) that all emotions are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by love. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> also, since it is an emotion of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by love.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), love consists in a certain agreement of the lover with the object loved, while <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> consists in a certain disagreement or dissonance. Now we should consider in each thing, what agrees with it, before that which disagrees: since a thing disagrees with another, through destroying or hindering that which agrees with it. Consequently love must needs precede <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>; and nothing is <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>, save through being contrary to a suitable thing which is loved. And hence it is that every <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by love.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The opposite members of a division are sometimes <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> simultaneous, both really and <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a>; e.g. two <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of animal, or two <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of color. Sometimes they are simultaneous <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a>, while, in reality, one precedes, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the other; e.g. the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of numbers, figures and movements. Sometimes they are not simultaneous either really or <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a>; e.g. <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> and <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>; for <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is in reality the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>; and being is predicated of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> before it is predicated of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, by a priority of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, because it is not predicated of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> except inasmuch as the latter is in <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Now love and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> simultaneous, <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> but not really. Wherefore nothing hinders love from being the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Love and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> are contraries if considered in respect of the same thing. But if taken in respect of contraries, they are not themselves contrary, but consequent to one another: for it amounts to the same that one love a certain thing, or that one <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> its contrary. Thus love of one thing is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of one's hating its contrary.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In the order of execution, the turning away from one term precedes the turning towards the other. But the reverse is the case in the order of <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>: since approach to one term is the reason for turning away from the other. Now the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> movement belongs rather to the order of <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> than to that of execution. Wherefore love precedes <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>: because each is an <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> movement.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether hatred is stronger than love?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is stronger than love. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. 83, qu. 36): "There is no one who does not flee from pain, more than he desires pleasure." But flight from pain pertains to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>; while desire for pleasure belongs to love. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is stronger than love.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the weaker is overcome by the stronger. But love is overcome by <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>: when, that is to say, love is turned into <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is stronger than love.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the emotions of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are shown by their effects. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> insists more on repelling what is hateful, than on seeking what is pleasant: thus also irrational animals refrain from pleasure for fear of the whip, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> instances (QQ. 83, qu. 36). Therefore <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is stronger than love.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Good is stronger than <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; because "<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> does nothing except in virtue of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv). But <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> and love differ according to the difference of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore love is stronger than <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is impossible for an effect to be stronger than its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Now every <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> arises from some love as its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as above stated (2). Therefore it is impossible for <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> to be stronger than love absolutely.

<p>But furthermore, love must needs be, absolutely speaking, stronger than <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. Because a thing is moved to the end more strongly than to the means. Now turning away from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is directed as a means to the gaining of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Wherefore, absolutely speaking, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> movement in respect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is stronger than its movement in respect of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p>Nevertheless <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> sometimes seems to be stronger than love, for two reasons. First, because <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is more keenly felt than love. For, since the sensitive perception is accompanied by a certain impression; when once the impression has been received it is not felt so keenly as in the moment of receiving it. Hence the heat of a hectic fever, though greater, is nevertheless not felt so much as the heat of tertian fever; because the heat of the hectic fever is <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> and like a second <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For this reason, love is felt more keenly in the absence of the object loved; thus <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. x, 12) that "love is felt more keenly when we lack what we love." And for the same reason, the unbecomingness of that which is <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> is felt more keenly than the becomingness of that which is loved. Secondly, because comparison is made between a <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> and a love which are not mutually corresponding. Because, according to different degrees of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> there are different degrees of love to which correspond different degrees of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. Wherefore a <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> that corresponds to a greater love, moves us more than a lesser love.

<p>Hence it is clear how to reply to the First Objection. For the love of pleasure is less than the love of self-preservation, to which corresponds flight from pain. Wherefore we flee from pain more than we love pleasure.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether a man can hate himself?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a man can <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> himself. For it is written (<a href="../bible/psa010.htm#verse6">Psalm 10:6</a>): "He that loveth <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, hateth his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>." But many love <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>. Therefore many <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> themselves.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, him we <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>, to whom we wish and work <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But sometimes a man wishes and works <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to himself, e.g. a man who kills himself. Therefore some men <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> themselves.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Consol. ii) that "avarice makes a man hateful"; whence we may conclude that everyone <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> a miser. But some men are misers. Therefore they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> themselves.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse29">Ephesians 5:29</a>) that "no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ever <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> his own flesh."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Properly speaking, it is impossible for a man to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> himself. For everything <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> desires <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, nor can anyone desire anything for himself, save under the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: for "<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is outside the scope of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>," as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv). Now to love a man is to will <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to him, as stated above (Question 26, Article 4). Consequently, a man must, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, love himself; and it is impossible for a man to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> himself, properly speaking.

<p>But <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> it happens that a man <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> himself: and this in two ways. First, on the part of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which a man wills to himself. For it happens sometimes that what is desired as <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in some particular respect, is simply <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; and in this way, a man <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> wills <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to himself; and thus <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> himself. Secondly, in regard to himself, to whom he wills <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. For each thing is that which is predominant in it; wherefore the state is said to do what the king does, as if the king were the whole state. Now it is clear that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is principally the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. And it happens that some men account themselves as being principally that which they are in their material and sensitive <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Wherefore they love themselves according to what they take themselves to be, while they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> that which they really are, by desiring what is contrary to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. And in both these ways, "he that loveth <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> hateth" not only "his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>," but also himself.

<p>Wherefore the reply to the First Objection is evident.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> wills and works <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to himself, except he apprehend it under the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. For even they who kill themselves, apprehend death itself as a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, considered as putting an end to some unhappiness or pain.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The miser <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> something <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to himself, but not for that reason does he <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> himself: thus a sick <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his sickness for the very reason that he loves himself. Or we may say that avarice makes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hateful to others, but not to himself. In fact, it is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by inordinate self-love, in respect of which, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> desires temporal goods for himself more than he should.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether a man can hate the truth?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a man cannot <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and being are convertible. But a man cannot <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Neither, therefore, can he <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "All men have a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> desire for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>," as stated in the beginning of the Metaphysics i, 1. But <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is only of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> desired and loved. But that which is in a thing <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, is always in it. Therefore no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 4) that "men love those who are straightforward." But there can be no other motive for this save <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> loves the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>. Therefore he cannot <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> it.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse16">Galatians 4:16</a>): "Am I become your enemy because I tell you the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>?" [<a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> quotes the passage, probably from <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, as though it were an assertion: "I am become," etc.]

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Good, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and being are the same in reality, but differ as considered by reason. For <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is considered in the light of something desirable, while being and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> are not so considered: because <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is "what all things seek." Wherefore <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as such, cannot be the object of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, neither in general nor in particular. Being and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in general cannot be the object of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>: because disagreement is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, and agreement is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of love; while being and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> are common to all things. But nothing hinders some particular being or some particular <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> being an object of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, in so far as it is considered as hurtful and repugnant; since hurtfulness and repugnance are not incompatible with the notion of being and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as they are with the notion of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p>Now it may happen in three ways that some particular <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is repugnant or hurtful to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> we love. First, according as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is in things as in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and origin. And thus <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> sometimes <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> a particular <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, when he wishes that what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> were not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Secondly, according as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which hinders him from gaining the object loved: such is the case of those who wish not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that they may <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> freely; in whose <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> it is said (<a href="../bible/job021.htm#verse14">Job 21:14</a>): "We desire not the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Thy ways." Thirdly, a particular <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>, as being repugnant, inasmuch as it is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: as, for instance, when a man wishes to remain hidden in his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> that anyone should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> about his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. In this respect, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. x, 23) that men "love <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> when it enlightens, they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> it when it reproves."

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is lovable in itself: hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says that men love it when it enlightens. But <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> may become hateful, in so far as it hinders one from accomplishing one's desire.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The reason why we love those who are straightforward is that they make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, considered in itself, is a desirable thing.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether anything can be an object of universal hatred?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a thing cannot be an object of universal <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. Because <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, which is moved by an apprehension in the senses. But the senses cannot apprehend the universal. Therefore a thing cannot be an object of universal <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by disagreement; and where there is disagreement, there is nothing in common. But the notion of universality implies something in common. Therefore nothing can be the object of universal <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the object of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But "<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is in things, and not in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>" (Metaph. vi, 4). Since therefore the universal is in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> only, which abstracts the universal from the particular, it would seem that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> cannot have a universal object.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 4) that "<a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is directed to something singular, whereas <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is also directed to a thing in general; for everybody <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a> and the backbiter."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There are two ways of speaking of the universal: first, as considered under the aspect of universality; secondly, as considered in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to which it is ascribed: for it is one thing to consider the universal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and another to consider a man as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. If, therefore, we take the universal, in the first way, no sensitive power, whether of apprehension or of <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, can attain the universal: because the universal is obtained by abstraction from <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, on which every sensitive power is based.

<p>Nevertheless the sensitive powers, both of apprehension and of <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, can tend to something universally. Thus we say that the object of sight is color considered generically; not that the sight is cognizant of universal color, but because the fact that color is cognizant by the sight, is attributed to color, not as being this particular color, but simply because it is color. Accordingly <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> in the sensitive faculty can regard something universally: because this thing, by reason of its common <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and not merely as an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, is hostile to the animal--for instance, a wolf in regard to a sheep. Hence a sheep <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> the wolf universally. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is always <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by something in particular: because it is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by some action of the one that hurts us; and actions proceed from <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>. For this reason the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 4) that "<a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is always directed to something singular, whereas <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> can be directed to a thing in general."

<p>But according as <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> part, since it arises from the universal apprehension of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, it can regard the universal in both ways.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The senses do not apprehend the universal, as such: but they apprehend something to which the character of universality is given by <a href="../cathen/01074a.htm">abstraction</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> That which is common to all cannot be a reason of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. But nothing hinders a thing from being common to many, and at variance with others, so as to be hateful to them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument considers the universal under the aspect of universality: and thus it does not come under the sensitive apprehension or <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.
