<h1>Question 29. Peace</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3029.htm#article1"> Is peace the same as concord?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3029.htm#article2"> Do all things desire peace?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3029.htm#article3"> Is peace an effect of charity?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3029.htm#article4"> Is peace a virtue?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether peace is the same as concord?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that peace is the same as concord. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xix, 13): "Peace among men is well ordered concord." Now we are speaking here of no other peace than that of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Therefore peace is the same as concord.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, concord is union of wills. Now the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of peace consists in such like union, for <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. xi) that peace unites all, and makes them of one mind. Therefore peace is the same as concord.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, things whose opposites are identical are themselves identical. Now the one same thing is opposed to concord and peace, viz. dissension; hence it is written (<a href="../bible/1co016.htm#verse33">1 Corinthians 16:33</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of dissension but of peace." Therefore peace is the same as concord.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> There can be concord in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> between <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men. But "there is no peace to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>" (<a href="../bible/isa048.htm#verse22">Isaiah 48:22</a>). Therefore peace is not the same as concord.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Peace includes concord and adds something thereto. Hence wherever peace is, there is concord, but there is not peace, wherever there is concord, if we give peace its proper meaning.

<p>For concord, properly speaking, is between one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and another, in so far as the wills of various hearts agree together in consenting to the same thing. Now the heart of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may happen to tend to diverse things, and this in two ways. First, in respect of the diverse <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> powers: thus the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> tends sometimes to that which is opposed to the rational <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, according to <a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse17">Galatians 5:17</a>: "The flesh <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusteth</a> against the spirit." Secondly, in so far as one and the same <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power tends to diverse objects of <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, which it cannot obtain all at the same time: so that there must needs be a clashing of the movements of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Now the union of such movements is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to peace, because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> heart is not at peace, so long as he has not what he wants, or if, having what he wants, there still remains something for him to want, and which he cannot have at the same time. On the other hand this union is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to concord: wherefore concord denotes union of appetites among various <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, while peace denotes, in addition to this union, the union of the appetites even in one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is speaking there of that peace which is between one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and another, and he says that this peace is concord, not indeed any kind of concord, but that which is well ordered, through one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> agreeing with another in respect of something befitting to both of them . For if one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> concord with another, not of his own accord, but through being forced, as it were, by the fear of some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that besets him, such concord is not really peace, because the order of each concordant is not observed, but is disturbed by some fear-inspiring <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. For this reason he premises that "peace is tranquillity of order," which tranquillity consists in all the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> movements in one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> being set at rest together.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> If one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> consent to the same thing together with another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, his consent is nevertheless not perfectly united to himself, unless at the same time all his <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> movements be in agreement.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A twofold dissension is opposed to peace, namely dissension between a man and himself, and dissension between one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and another. The latter alone is opposed to concord.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether all things desire peace?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that not all things desire peace. For, according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. xi), peace "unites consent." But there cannot be unity of consent in things which are devoid of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Therefore such things cannot desire peace.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> does not tend to opposite things at the same time. Now many desire <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and dissension. Therefore all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> do not desire peace.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> alone is an object of <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. But a certain peace is, seemingly, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, else <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> would not have said (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse34">Matthew 10:34</a>): "I came not to send peace." Therefore all things do not desire peace.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, that which all desire is, seemingly, the sovereign <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is the last end. But this is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of peace, since it is attainable even by a wayfarer; else <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> would vainly command (<a href="../bible/mar009.htm#verse49">Mark 9:49</a>): "Have peace among you." Therefore all things do not desire peace.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xix, 12,14) that "all things desire peace": and <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says the same (Div. Nom. xi).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> From the very fact that a man desires a certain thing it follows that he desires to obtain what he desires, and, in consequence, to remove whatever may be an obstacle to his obtaining it. Now a man may be hindered from obtaining the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> he desires, by a contrary desire either of his own or of some other, and both are removed by peace, as stated above. Hence it follows of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> that whoever desires anything desires peace, in so far as he who desires anything, desires to attain, with tranquillity and without hindrance, to that which he desires: and this is what is meant by peace which <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> defines (De Civ. Dei xix, 13) "the tranquillity of order."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Peace denotes union not only of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> or rational <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, or of the animal <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, in both of which consent may be found, but also of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says that "peace is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of consent and of connaturalness," where "consent" denotes the union of appetites proceeding from <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and "connaturalness," the union of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> appetites.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Even those who seek <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and dissension, desire nothing but peace, which they deem themselves not to have. For as we stated above, there is no peace when a man concords with another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> counter to what he would prefer. Consequently men seek by means of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> to break this concord, because it is a defective peace, in order that they may obtain peace, where nothing is contrary to their will. Hence all <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> are waged that men may find a more perfect peace than that which they had heretofore.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Peace gives calm and unity to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Now just as the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> may tend to what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> simply, or to what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> apparently, so too, peace may be either <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> or apparent. There can be no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> peace except where the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is directed to what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, though it may appear <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in a way, so as to calm the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> in some respect, has, nevertheless many defects, which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> to remain restless and disturbed. Hence <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> peace is only in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> men and about <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things. The peace of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> peace but a semblance thereof, wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/wis014.htm#verse22">Wisdom 14:22</a>): "Whereas they lived in a great <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, they call so many and so great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> peace."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> peace is only about <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is possessed in two ways, perfectly and imperfectly, so there is a twofold <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> peace. One is perfect peace. It consists in the perfect enjoyment of the sovereign <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and unites all one's desires by giving them rest in one object. This is the last end of the rational creature, according to <a href="../bible/psa147.htm#verse3">Psalm 147:3</a>: "Who hath placed peace in thy borders." The other is imperfect peace, which may be had in this world, for though the chief movement of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> finds rest in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet there are certain things within and without which disturb the peace.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether peace is the proper effect of charity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that peace is not the proper effect of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For one cannot have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> without <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>. But some have peace who have not <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, thus <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> sometimes have peace. Therefore peace is not the effect of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if a certain thing is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, its contrary is not compatible with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. But dissension, which is contrary to peace, is compatible with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, for we find that even <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>, such as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, dissented in some of their opinions. We also read that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and Barnabas dissented from one another (<a href="../bible/act015.htm">Acts 15</a>). Therefore it seems that peace is not the effect of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the same thing is not the proper effect of different things. Now peace is the effect of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, according to <a href="../bible/isa032.htm#verse17">Isaiah 32:17</a>: "And the work of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> shall be peace." Therefore it is not the effect of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa118.htm#verse165">Psalm 118:165</a>): "Much peace have they that love Thy Law."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Peace implies a twofold union, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). The first is the result of one's own appetites being directed to one object; while the other results from one's own <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> being united with the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> of another: and each of these unions is effected by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>--the first, in so far as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with his whole heart, by referring all things to Him, so that all his desires tend to one object--the second, in so far as we love our neighbor as ourselves, the result being that we wish to fulfil our neighbor's will as though it were ours: hence it is reckoned a sign of friendship if people "make choice of the same things" (Ethic. ix, 4), and Tully says (De Amicitia) that friends "like and dislike the same things" (Sallust, Catilin.)

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> no one falls from a state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, for it turns <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> away from his due end by making him place his end in something undue: so that his <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> does not cleave chiefly to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> final <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but to some apparent <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Hence, without <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, peace is not real but merely apparent.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ix, 6) friends need not agree in opinion, but only upon such goods as conduce to life, and especially upon such as are important; because dissension in small matters is scarcely accounted dissension. Hence nothing hinders those who have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> from holding different opinions. Nor is this an obstacle to peace, because opinions concern the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which precedes the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> that is united by peace. On like manner if there be concord as to goods of importance, dissension with regard to some that are of little account is not contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: for such a dissension proceeds from a difference of opinion, because one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> thinks that the particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is the object of dissension, belongs to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> about which they agree, while the other thinks that it does not. Accordingly such like dissension about very slight matters and about opinions is inconsistent with a state of perfect peace, wherein the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> will be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> fully, and every desire fulfilled; but it is not inconsistent with the imperfect peace of the wayfarer.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Peace is the "work of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>" indirectly, in so far as <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> removes the obstacles to peace: but it is the work of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> directly, since <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, according to its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> peace. For love is "a unitive force" as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv): and peace is the union of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite's</a> inclinations.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether peace is a virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that peace is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For nothing is a matter of precept, unless it be an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But there are precepts about keeping peace, for example: "Have peace among you" (<a href="../bible/mar009.htm#verse49">Mark 9:49</a>). Therefore peace is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, we do not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> except by acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now it is <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> to keep peace, according to <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse9">Matthew 5:9</a>: "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore peace is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are opposed to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. But dissensions, which are contrary to peace, are numbered among the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse20">Galatians 5:20</a>). Therefore peace is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Virtue is not the last end, but the way thereto. But peace is the last end, in a sense, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xix, 11). Therefore peace is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 28, Article 4), when a number of acts all proceeding uniformly from an agent, follow one from the other, they all arise from the same <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, nor do they each have a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> from which they proceed, as may be seen in corporeal things. For, though fire by heating, both liquefies and rarefies, there are not two powers in fire, one of liquefaction, the other of rarefaction: and fire produces all such actions by its own power of calefaction.

<p>Since then <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> peace precisely because it is love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of our neighbor, as shown above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), there is no other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> except <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> whose proper act is peace, as we have also said in reference to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> (28, 4).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> We are commanded to keep peace because it is an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; and for this reason too it is a <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> act. Hence it is placed among the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a>, which are acts of perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated above (I-II, 69, 1,3). It is also numbered among the fruits, in so far as it is a final <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, having <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> sweetness.

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the Second Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Several <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are opposed to one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in respect of its various acts: so that not only is <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> opposed to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, in respect of its act which is love, but also sloth and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, in respect of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and dissension in respect of peace.
