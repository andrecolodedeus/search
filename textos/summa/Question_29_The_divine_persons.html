<h1>Question 29. The divine persons</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1029.htm#article1"> The definition of "person"</a> <li><a href="../summa/1029.htm#article2"> The comparison of person to essence, subsistence, and hypostasis</a> <li><a href="../summa/1029.htm#article3"> Is the name of person becoming to God?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1029.htm#article4"> What does it signify in Him?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. The definition of "person"</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the definition of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> given by <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> (De Duab. Nat.) is insufficient--that is, "a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of a rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." For nothing singular can be subject to definition. But "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>" signifies something singular. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is improperly defined.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> as placed above in the definition of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, is either first <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, or second <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. If it is the former, the word "individual" is superfluous, because first <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>; if it stands for second <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, the word "individual" is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, for there is contradiction of terms; since second <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> are the "genera" or "<a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>." Therefore this definition is incorrect.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, an intentional term must not be included in the definition of a thing. For to define a man as "a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of animal" would not be a correct definition; since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is the name of a thing, and "<a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>" is a name of an <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>. Therefore, since <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is the name of a thing (for it signifies a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of a rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>), the word "individual" which is an intentional name comes improperly into the definition.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, "Nature is the principle of motion and rest, in those things in which it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, and not <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>," as <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> says (Phys. ii). But <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in things immovable, as in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Therefore the word "nature" ought not to enter into the definition of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, but the word should rather be "<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; but it is not a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is not properly defined as above.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Although the universal and particular <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in every genus, nevertheless, in a certain special way, the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> belongs to the genus of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. For <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is individualized by itself; whereas the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> are individualized by the subject, which is the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>; since this particular whiteness is called "this," because it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in this particular subject. And so it is reasonable that the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> of the genus <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> should have a special name of their own; for they are called "hypostases," or first <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>.

<p>Further still, in a more special and perfect way, the particular and the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> are found in the rational <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> which have dominion over their own actions; and which are not only made to act, like others; but which can act of themselves; for actions belong to singulars. Therefore also the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> of the rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> have a special name even among other <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>; and this name is "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>."

<p>Thus the term "<a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>" is placed in the definition of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, as signifying the singular in the genus of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>; and the term "rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>" is added, as signifying the singular in rational <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although this or that singular may not be definable, yet what belongs to the general <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of singularity can be defined; and so the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Praedic., cap. De substantia) gives a definition of first <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>; and in this way <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> defines <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In the opinion of some, the term "<a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>" in the definition of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> stands for first <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, which is the hypostasis; nor is the term "<a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>" superfluously added, forasmuch as by the name of hypostasis or first <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of universality and of part is excluded. For we do not say that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in general is an hypostasis, nor that the hand is since it is only a part. But where "<a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>" is added, the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of assumptibility is excluded from <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; for the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, since it is assumed by a greater--that is, by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>. It is, however, better to say that <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is here taken in a general sense, as divided into first and second, and when "<a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>" is added, it is restricted to first <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">Substantial</a> differences being unknown to us, or at least unnamed by us, it is sometimes <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to use <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> differences in the place of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a>; as, for example, we may say that fire is a simple, hot, and dry body: for proper <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> are the effects of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> forms, and make them <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Likewise, terms expressive of <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> can be used in defining realities if used to signify things which are unnamed. And so the term "<a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>" is placed in the definition of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to signify the mode of subsistence which belongs to particular <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. v, 5), the word "nature" was first used to signify the generation of living things, which is called nativity. And because this kind of generation comes from an intrinsic principle, this term is extended to signify the intrinsic principle of any kind of movement. In this sense he defines "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>" (Phys. ii, 3). And since this kind of principle is either formal or material, both <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> are commonly called <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. And as the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of anything is completed by the form; so the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of anything, signified by the definition, is commonly called <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. And here <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is taken in that sense. Hence <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Duab. Nat.) that, "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is the specific difference giving its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> to each thing," for the specific difference completes the definition, and is derived from the special form of a thing. So in the definition of "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>," which means the singular in a determined "genus," it is more correct to use the term "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>" than "<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>," because the latter is taken from being, which is most common.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a part of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; and so, although it may <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in a separate state, yet since it ever retains its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of unibility, it cannot be called an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, which is the hypostasis or first <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, as neither can the hand nor any other part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; thus neither the definition nor the name of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> belongs to it.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether "person" is the same as hypostasis, subsistence, and essence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>" is the same as "hypostasis," "subsistence," and "<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>." For <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Duab. Nat.) that "the Greeks called the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> by the name hypostasis." But this with us signifies "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>." Therefore "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>" is altogether the same as "hypostasis."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as we say there are three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so we say there are three subsistences in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; which implies that "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>" and "subsistence" have the same meaning. Therefore "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>" and "subsistence" mean the same.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (Com. Praed.) that the Greek <em>ousia</em>, which means <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, signifies a being composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Now that which is composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> is the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> called "hypostasis" and "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>." Therefore all the aforesaid names seem to have the same meaning.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Duab. Nat.) that genera and <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> only subsist; whereas <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> are not only subsistent, but also substand. But subsistences are so called from subsisting, as <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> or hypostasis is so called from substanding. Therefore, since genera and <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are not hypostases or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, these are not the same as subsistences.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (Com. Praed.) that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is called hypostasis, and form is called <em>ousiosis</em>--that is, subsistence. But neither form nor <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> can be called <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> differs from the others.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. v), <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is twofold. In one sense it means the quiddity of a thing, signified by its definition, and thus we say that the definition means the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of a thing; in which sense <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is called by the Greeks <em>ousia</em>, what we may call "<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>." In another sense <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> means a subject or "suppositum," which subsists in the genus of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. To this, taken in a general sense, can be applied a name expressive of an <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>; and thus it is called "suppositum." It is also called by three names signifying a reality--that is, "a thing of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>," "subsistence," and "hypostasis," according to a threefold consideration of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> thus named. For, as it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in itself and not in another, it is called "subsistence"; as we say that those things subsist which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in themselves, and not in another. As it underlies some common <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it is called "a thing of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>"; as, for instance, this particular <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> thing. As it underlies the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, it is called "hypostasis," or "<a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>." What these three names signify in common to the whole genus of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, this name "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>" signifies in the genus of rational <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Among the Greeks the term "hypostasis," taken in the strict interpretation of the word, signifies any <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> of the genus <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>; but in the usual way of speaking, it means the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> of the rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, by reason of the excellence of that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As we say "three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>" plurally in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and "three subsistences," so the Greeks say "three hypostases." But because the word "substance," which, properly speaking, corresponds in meaning to "hypostasis," is used among us in an equivocal sense, since it sometimes means <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, and sometimes means hypostasis, in order to avoid any occasion of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, it was thought preferable to use "subsistence" for hypostasis, rather than "<a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Strictly speaking, the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is what is expressed by the definition. Now, the definition comprises the principles of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but not the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> principles. Hence in things composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> signifies not only the form, nor only the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but what is composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and the common form, as the principles of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But what is composed of this matter and this form has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of hypostasis and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. For <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, flesh, and bone belong to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; whereas this <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, this flesh and this bone belong to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore hypostasis and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> add the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> principles to the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; nor are these identified with the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> in things composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, as we said above when treating of divine simplicity (3, 3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says that genera and <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> subsist, inasmuch as it belongs to some <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> things to subsist, from the fact that they belong to genera and <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> comprised in the predicament of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, but not because the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and genera themselves subsist; except in the opinion of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, who asserted that the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of things subsisted separately from singular things. To substand, however, belongs to the same <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> things in relation to the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, which are outside the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of genera and <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> substands in relation to <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> from the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Trin.): "A simple form cannot be a subject." Its self-subsistence is derived from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, which does not supervene to the things subsisting, but gives actual <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> to the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and makes it subsist as an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. On this account, therefore, he ascribes hypostasis to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and <em>ousiosis</em>, or subsistence, to the form, because the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is the principle of substanding, and form is the principle of subsisting.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the word "person" should be said of God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the name "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>" should not be said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom.): "No one should ever dare to say or think anything of the supersubstantial and hidden Divinity, beyond what has been divinely expressed to us by the oracles." But the name "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>" is not expressed to us in the Old or <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. Therefore "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>" is not to be applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Duab. Nat.): "The word <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> seems to be taken from those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who represented men in comedies and tragedies. For <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> comes from sounding through [personando], since a greater volume of sound is produced through the cavity in the mask. These "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>" or masks the Greeks called <em>prosopa</em>, as they were placed on the face and covered the features before the eyes." This, however, can apply to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> only in a metaphorical sense. Therefore the word "person" is only applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> metaphorically.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is a hypostasis. But the word "hypostasis" does not apply to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since, as <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Duab. Nat.), it signifies what is the subject of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, which do not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> also says (Ep. ad Damas.) that, "in this word hypostasis, poison lurks in honey." Therefore the word "person" should not be said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, if a definition is denied of anything, the thing defined is also denied of it. But the definition of "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>," as given above, does not apply to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Both because reason implies a discursive <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which does not apply to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as we <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> above (14, 1); and thus <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be said to have "a rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." And also because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be called an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, since the principle of individuation is <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; while <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is immaterial: nor is He the subject of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, so as to be called a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Therefore the word "person" ought not to be attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/02033b.htm">Creed of Athanasius</a> we say: "One is the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Father, another of the Son, another of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> "Person" signifies what is most perfect in all <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>--that is, a subsistent <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> of a rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence, since everything that is perfect must be attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, forasmuch as His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> contains every perfection, this name "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>" is fittingly applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; not, however, as it is applied to creatures, but in a more excellent way; as other names also, which, while giving them to creatures, we attribute to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; as we showed above when treating of the names of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (13, 2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although the word "person" is not found applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>, either in the Old or <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, nevertheless what the word signifies is found to be affirmed of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in many places of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>; as that He is the supreme self-subsisting being, and the most perfectly <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> being. If we could speak of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> only in the very terms themselves of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>, it would follow that no one could speak about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in any but the original language of the Old or <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. The urgency of confuting <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> made it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to find new words to express the ancient <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Nor is such a kind of novelty to be shunned; since it is by no means profane, for it does not lead us astray from the sense of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> warns us to avoid "profane novelties of words" (<a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse20">1 Timothy 6:20</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although this name "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>" may not belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as regards the origin of the term, nevertheless it excellently belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in its objective meaning. For as famous men were represented in comedies and tragedies, the name "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>" was given to signify those who held high dignity. Hence, those who held high rank in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> came to be called "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>." Thence by some the definition of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is given as "hypostasis distinct by reason of dignity." And because subsistence in a rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is of high dignity, therefore every <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> of the rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is called a "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>." Now the dignity of the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> excels every other dignity; and thus the name "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>" pre-eminently belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The word "hypostasis" does not apply to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as regards its source of origin, since He does not underlie <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>; but it applies to Him in its objective sense, for it is imposed to signify the subsistence. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> said that "poison lurks in this word," forasmuch as before it was fully understood by the Latins, the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> used this term to deceive the simple, to make people profess many <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essences</a> as they profess several hypostases, inasmuch as the word "substance," which corresponds to hypostasis in Greek, is commonly taken amongst us to mean <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> It may be said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has a rational "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>," if reason be taken to mean, not discursive thought, but in a general sense, an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be called an "<a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>" in the sense that His <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuality</a> comes from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; but only in the sense which implies incommunicability. "Substance" can be applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the sense of signifying self-subsistence. There are some, however, who say that the definition of <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a>, quoted above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), is not a definition of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in the sense we use when speaking of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/13045c.htm">Richard of St. Victor</a> amends this definition by adding that "Person" in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is "the incommunicable <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>."

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether this word "person" signifies relation?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that this word "person," as applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, does not signify relation, but <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. vii, 6): "When we speak of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Father, we mean nothing else but the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the Father, for <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is said in regard to Himself, and not in regard to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the interrogation "What?" refers to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. But, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says: "When we say there are three who bear witness in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, the Father, the Word, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and it is asked, Three what? the answer is, Three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> signifies <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. iv), the meaning of a word is its definition. But the definition of "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>" is this: "The <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>," as above stated. Therefore "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>" signifies <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in men and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> does not signify relation, but something absolute. Therefore, if in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> it signified relation, it would bear an equivocal meaning in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Trin.) that "every word that refers to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> signifies relation." But no word belongs to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> more strictly than the very word "person" itself. Therefore this word "person" signifies relation.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A difficulty arises concerning the meaning of this word "person" in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from the fact that it is predicated plurally of the Three in contrast to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the names belonging to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; nor does it in itself refer to another, as do the words which express relation.

<p>Hence some have thought that this word "person" of itself expresses absolutely the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; as this name "God" and this word "Wise"; but that to meet <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> attack, it was ordained by conciliar decree that it was to be taken in a relative sense, and especially in the plural, or with the addition of a distinguishing adjective; as when we say, "Three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>," or, "one is the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Father, another of the Son," etc. Used, however, in the singular, it may be either absolute or relative. But this does not seem to be a satisfactory explanation; for, if this word "person," by force of its own signification, expresses the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> only, it follows that forasmuch as we speak of "three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>," so far from the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> being silenced, they had still more reason to argue. Seeing this, others maintained that this word "person" in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> signifies both the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and the relation. Some of these said that it signifies directly the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, and relation indirectly, forasmuch as "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>" means as it were "by itself one" [per se una]; and unity belongs to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. And what is "by itself" implies relation indirectly; for the Father is understood to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> "by Himself," as relatively distinct from the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. Others, however, said, on the contrary, that it signifies relation directly; and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> indirectly; forasmuch as in the definition of "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>" the term <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is mentioned indirectly; and these come nearer to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p>To determine the question, we must consider that something may be included in the meaning of a less common term, which is not included in the more common term; as "rational" is included in the meaning of "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," and not in the meaning of "animal." So that it is one thing to ask the meaning of the word animal, and another to ask its meaning when the animal in question is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Also, it is one thing to ask the meaning of this word "person" in general; and another to ask the meaning of "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>" as applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>" in general signifies the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of a rational figure. The <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> in itself is undivided, but is distinct from others. Therefore "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>" in any <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> signifies what is distinct in that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: thus in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> it signifies this flesh, these bones, and this <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which are the individuating principles of a man, and which, though not belonging to "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>" in general, nevertheless do belong to the meaning of a particular <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p>Now distinction in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is only by relation of origin, as stated above (28, 2, 3), while relation in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not as an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> in a subject, but is the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> itself; and so it is subsistent, for the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> subsists. Therefore, as the Godhead is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> so the divine paternity is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father, Who is a divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Therefore a divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> signifies a relation as subsisting. And this is to signify relation by way of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, and such a relation is a hypostasis subsisting in the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, although in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that which subsists in the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> itself. Thus it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to say that the name "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>" signifies relation directly, and the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> indirectly; not, however, the relation as such, but as expressed by way of a hypostasis. So likewise it signifies directly the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, and indirectly the relation, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is the same as the hypostasis: while in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the hypostasis is expressed as distinct by the relation: and thus relation, as such, enters into the notion of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> indirectly. Thus we can say that this signification of the word "person" was not clearly perceived before it was attacked by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Hence, this word "person" was used just as any other absolute term. But afterwards it was applied to express relation, as it lent itself to that signification, so that this word "person" means relation not only by use and custom, according to the first opinion, but also by force of its own proper signification.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This word "person" is said in respect to itself, not to another; forasmuch as it signifies relation not as such, but by way of a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>--which is a hypostasis. In that sense <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says that it signifies the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, inasmuch as in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is the same as the hypostasis, because in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> what He is, and whereby He is are the same.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The term "what" refers sometimes to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> expressed by the definition, as when we ask; What is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>? and we answer: A mortal rational animal. Sometimes it refers to the "suppositum," as when we ask, What swims in the sea? and answer, A fish. So to those who ask, Three what? we answer, Three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>--i.e. distinct and incommunicable <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>--includes the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of relation, as above explained.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The different sense of the less common term does not produce equivocation in the more common. Although a horse and an ass have their own proper definitions, nevertheless they agree univocally in animal, because the common definition of animal applies to both. So it does not follow that, although relation is contained in the signification of divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, but not in that of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> or of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, the word "person" is used in an equivocal sense. Though neither is it applied univocally, since nothing can be said univocally of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and creatures (13, 5).
