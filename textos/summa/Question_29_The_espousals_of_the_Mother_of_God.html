<h1>Question 29. The espousals of the Mother of God</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/4029.htm#article1"> Should Christ have been born of an espoused virgin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4029.htm#article2"> Was there true marriage between our Lord's Mother and Joseph?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether Christ should have been born of an espoused virgin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should not have been born of an espoused <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. For espousals are ordered to carnal intercourse. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> Mother never wished to have carnal intercourse with her husband; because this would be derogatory to the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> of her mind. Therefore she should not have been espoused.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> was <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a>, whence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. ad Volus. cxxxvii): "This same power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> brought forth the infant's limbs out of the virginal womb of His inviolate Mother, by which in the vigor of manhood He passed through the closed doors. If we are told why this happened, it will cease to be wonderful; if another instance be alleged, it will no longer be unique." But <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> that are wrought in confirmation of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> should be manifest. Since, therefore, by her Espousals this <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> would be less evident, it seems that it was unfitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should be born of an espoused <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on <a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse18">Matthew 1:18</a>, gives as a reason of the espousals of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, "that the manner of His Birth might be hidden from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, who would think Him to be begotten not of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> but of a wife." But this seems to be no reason at all. First, because by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> cunning he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> whatever takes place in bodies. Secondly, because later on the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, through many evident signs, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> after a fashion: whence it is written (<a href="../bible/mar001.htm#verse23">Mark 1:23-24</a>): "A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with an <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> spirit . . . cried out, saying: What have we to do with Thee, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>? Art Thou come to destroy us? I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> . . . Thou art the Holy one of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore it does not seem fitting that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> should have been espoused.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> gives as another reason, "lest the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> should be stoned by the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> as an adulteress." But this reason seems to have no weight, for if she were not espoused, she could not be condemned for <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. Therefore it does not seem reasonable that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should be born of an espoused <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse18">Matthew 1:18</a>): "When as His Mother Mary was espoused to <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>": and (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse26">Luke 1:26-27</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> Gabriel was sent . . . to a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> espoused to a man whose name was <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It was fitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should be born of an espoused <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>; first, for His own sake; secondly, for His Mother's sake; thirdly, for our sake. For the sake of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself, for four reasons. First, lest He should be rejected by unbelievers as <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a>: wherefore <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says on <a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse26">Luke 1:26-27</a>: "How could we blame Herod or the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> if they seem to persecute one who was born of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>?"

<p>Secondly, in order that in the customary way His genealogy might be traced through the male line. Thus <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says on <a href="../bible/luk003.htm#verse23">Luke 3:23</a>: "He Who came into the world, according to the custom of the world had to be enrolled Now for this purpose, it is the men that are required, because they represent the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> in the senate and other courts. The custom of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, too, shows that the ancestry of the men is always traced out."

<p>Thirdly, for the safety of the new-born Child: lest the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> should plot serious hurt against Him. Hence <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a> says that she was espoused "that the manner of His Birth might be hidden from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>."

<p>Fourthly, that He might be fostered by <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>: who is therefore called His "father," as bread-winner.

<p>It was also fitting for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin</a>. First, because thus she was rendered exempt from punishment; that is, "lest she should be stoned by the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> as an adulteress," as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says.

<p>Secondly, that thus she might be safeguarded from ill fame. Whence <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says on <a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse26">Luke 1:26-27</a>: "She was espoused lest she be wounded by the ill-fame of violated <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, in whom the pregnant womb would betoken corruption."

<p>Thirdly, that, as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says, <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> might administer to her wants.

<p>This was fitting, again, for our sake. First, because <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> is thus a witness to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> being born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says: "Her husband is the more trustworthy witness of her purity, in that he would deplore the dishonor, and avenge the disgrace, were it not that he acknowledged the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>."

<p>Secondly, because thereby the very words of the Virgin are rendered more credible by which she asserted her <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. Thus <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says: "Belief in Mary's words is strengthened, the motive for a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> is removed. If she had not been espoused when pregnant, she would seem to have wished to hide her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>: being espoused, she had no motive for lying, since a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> pregnancy is the reward of marriage and gives <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to the nuptial bond." These two reasons add strength to our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p>Thirdly, that all excuse be removed from those <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> who, through want of caution, fall into dishonor. Hence <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says: "It was not becoming that <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> should expose themselves to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> report, and cover themselves with the excuse that the Mother of the Lord had also been oppressed by ill-fame."

<p>Fourthly, because by this the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">universal</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is typified, which is a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> and yet is espoused to one Man, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Sanct. Virg. xii).

<p>A fifth reason may be added: since the Mother of the Lord being both espoused and a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, both <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> and wedlock are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> in her <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, in contradiction to those <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who disparaged one or the other.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> We must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, desired, from an intimate inspiration of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, to be espoused, being confident that by the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> she would never come to have carnal intercourse: yet she left this to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> discretion. Wherefore she suffered nothing in detriment to her <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says on <a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse26">Luke 1:26</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> preferred that men should <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> of His origin rather than of His Mother's purity. For he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the delicacy of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> modesty, and how easily the fair name of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is disparaged: nor did He choose that our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in His Birth should be strengthened in detriment to His Mother." We must observe, however, that some <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> wrought by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are the direct object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; such are the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of the virginal Birth, the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection of our Lord</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Sacrament of the Altar</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> wished these to be more hidden, that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in them might have greater <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. Whereas other <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are for the strengthening of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: and these it behooves to be manifest.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. ii.), the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> can do many things by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power which he is hindered by the Divine power from doing. Thus it may be that by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> could <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but was a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>; yet was prevented by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the manner of the Divine Birth. That afterwards the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> after a fashion <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that He was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, makes no difficulty: because then the time had already come for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> His power against the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and to suffer <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> aroused by him. But during His infancy it behooved the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> to be withheld, lest he should persecute Him too severely: for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not wish to suffer such things then, nor to make His power <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, but to show Himself to be in all things like other infants. Hence Pope Leo (Serm. in Epiph. iv) says that "the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> found the Child <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> small in body, dependent on others, unable to speak, and in no way differing from the generality of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> infants." <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a>, however, expounding <a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse26">Luke 1:26</a>, seems to understand this of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> members. For, after giving the above reason--namely, that the prince of the world might be deceived--he continues thus: "Yet still more did He deceive the princes of the world, since the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> disposition of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> easily discovers even hidden things: but those who spend their lives in worldly vanities can have no acquaintance of Divine things."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The sentence of adulteresses according to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> was that they should be stoned, not only if they were already espoused or <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a>, but also if their maidenhood were still under the protection of the paternal roof, until the day when they enter the <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> state. Thus it is written (<a href="../bible/deu022.htm#verse20">Deuteronomy 22:20-21</a>): "If . . . <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> be not found in the damsel . . . the men of the city shall stone her to death, and she shall die; because she hath done a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> thing in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, to play the whore in her father's house."

<p>It may also be said, according to some writers, that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> was of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> or kindred of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, so that she was related to Elizabeth, as we are told (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse36">Luke 1:36</a>). Now a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> tribe was condemned to death for whoredom; for we read (<a href="../bible/lev021.htm#verse9">Leviticus 21:9</a>): "If the daughter of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> be taken in whoredom, and dishonor the name of her father, she shall be burnt with fire."

<p>Lastly, some understand the passage of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> to refer to the throwing of stones by ill-fame.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether there was a true marriage between Mary and Joseph?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there was no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> marriage between Mary and Joseph. For <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says against Helvidius that <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> "was Mary's guardian rather than her husband." But if this was a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> marriage, <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> her husband. Therefore there was no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> marriage between Mary and <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, on <a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse16">Matthew 1:16</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> begot <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> the husband of Mary," <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says: "When thou readest 'husband' suspect not a marriage; but remember that <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> is wont to speak of those who are <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> as husband and wife." But a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> marriage is not effected by the <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothal</a>, but by the wedding. Therefore, there was no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> marriage between the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> and <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse19">Matthew 1:19</a>): "<a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>, her husband, being a just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and not willing to take her away [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'publicly to expose her', i.e. to take her to his home in order to cohabit with her, was minded to put her away privately, i.e. to postpone the wedding," as <a href="../cathen/12764a.htm">Remigius</a> [Cf. Catena Aurea in Matth.] expounds. Therefore, it seems that, as the wedding was not yet solemnized, there was no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> marriage: especially since, after the marriage contract, no one can lawfully put his wife away.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Consensu Evang. ii): "It cannot be allowed that the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> thought that <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> ought to sever his union with Mary" (since he said that <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> was Mary's husband) "on the ground that in giving birth to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, she had not conceived of him, but remained a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. For by this example the faithful are taught that if after marriage they remain continent by mutual consent, their union is still and is rightly called marriage, even without intercourse of the sexes."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Marriage or wedlock is said to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> by reason of its attaining its perfection. Now perfection of anything is twofold; first, and second. The first perfection of a thing consists in its very form, from which it receives its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; while the second perfection of a thing consists in its operation, by which in some way a thing attains its end. Now the form of <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> consists in a certain inseparable union of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, by which husband and wife are pledged by a bond of mutual affection that cannot be sundered. And the end of <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> is the begetting and upbringing of children: the first of which is attained by conjugal intercourse; the second by the other duties of husband and wife, by which they help one another in rearing their offspring.

<p>Thus we may say, as to the first perfection, that the marriage of the Virgin <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> and <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> was absolutely <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: because both consented to the nuptial bond, but not expressly to the bond of the flesh, save on the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> that it was pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For this reason the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> calls Mary the wife of <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>, saying to him (<a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse20">Matthew 1:20</a>): "Fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife": on which words <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Nup. et Concup. i): "She is called his wife from the first promise of her espousals, whom he had not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> nor ever was to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by carnal intercourse."

<p>But as to the second perfection which is attained by the marriage act, if this be referred to carnal intercourse, by which children are begotten; thus this marriage was not consummated. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says on <a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse26">Luke 1:26-27</a>: "Be not surprised that <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> calls Mary a wife. The fact of her marriage is declared, not to insinuate the loss of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, but to witness to the reality of the union." Nevertheless, this marriage had the second perfection, as to upbringing of the child. Thus <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Nup. et Concup. i): "All the nuptial blessings are fulfilled in the marriage of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> parents, offspring, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and sacrament. The offspring we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to have been the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>; <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, for there was no <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>: sacrament, since there was no <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a>. Carnal intercourse alone there was none."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> uses the term "husband" in reference to marriage consummated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> By <em>marriage</em> <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> means the nuptial intercourse.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. i super Matth. [Opus Imperfectum among the supposititious works ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a>) the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> was so espoused to <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> that she dwelt in his home: "for just as she who conceives in her husband's house is understood to have conceived of him, so she who conceives elsewhere is suspect." Consequently sufficient precaution would not have been taken to safeguard the fair fame of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, if she had not the entry of her husband's house. Wherefore the words, "not willing to take her away" are better rendered as meaning, "not willing publicly to expose her," than understood of taking her to his house. Hence the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> adds that "he was minded to put her away privately." But although she had the entry of <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph's</a> house by reason of her first promise of espousals, yet the time had not yet come for the solemnizing of the wedding; for which reason they had not yet consummated the marriage. Therefore, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. iv in Matth.): "The <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> does not say, 'before she was taken to the house of her husband,' because she was already in the house. For it was the custom among the ancients for espoused <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">maidens</a> to enter frequently the houses of them to whom they were <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a>." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> also said to <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>: "Fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife"; that is: "Fear not to solemnize your marriage with her." Others, however, say that she was not yet admitted to his house, but only <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> to him. But the first is more in keeping with the Gospel narrative.
