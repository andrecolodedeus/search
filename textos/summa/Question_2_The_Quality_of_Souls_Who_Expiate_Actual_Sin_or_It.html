<h1>Question 2. The Quality of Souls Who Expiate Actual Sin or Its Punishment in Purgatory</h1>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the pains of Purgatory surpass all the temporal pains of this life?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the pains of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> do not surpass all the temporal pains of this life. Because the more passive a thing is the more it suffers if it has the sense of being hurt. Now the body is more passive than the separate <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, both because it has contrariety to a fiery agent, and because it has <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> which is susceptive of the agent's <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>: and this cannot be said of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore the pain which the body suffers in this world is greater than the pain whereby the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is cleansed after this life.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the pains of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> are directly ordained against venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Now since venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are the least grievous, the lightest punishment is due to them, if the measure of the stripes is according to the measure of the fault. Therefore the pain of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> is the lightest of all.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, since the debt of punishment is an effect of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it does not increase unless the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> increases. Now <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot increase in one whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is already remitted. Therefore if a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has been remitted in a man who has not fully paid the debt of punishment, this debt does not increase when he dies. But while he lived he was not in debt to the extent of the most grievous punishment. Therefore the pain that he will suffer after this life will not be more grievous to him than all other pains of this life.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a sermon (xli De Sanctis): "This fire of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> will be more severe than any pain that can be felt, seen or conceived in this world."

<p>Further, the more universal a pain is the greater it is. Now the whole separate <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is punished, since it is simple: which is not the case with the body. Therefore this, being the punishment of the separate <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, is greater than any pain suffered by the body.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> there will be a twofold pain; one will be the pain of loss, namely the delay of the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">divine vision</a>, and the pain of sense, namely punishment by corporeal fire. With regard to both the least pain of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> surpasses the greatest pain of this life. For the more a thing is desired the more painful is its absence. And since after this life the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> desire the Sovereign Good with the most intense longing--both because their longing is not held back by the weight of the body, and because, had there been no obstacle, they would already have gained the goal of enjoying the Sovereign Good--it follows that they grieve exceedingly for their delay. Again, since pain is not hurt, but the sense of hurt, the more sensitive a thing is, the greater the pain <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by that which hurts it: wherefore hurts inflicted on the more sensible parts <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the greatest pain. And, because all bodily sensation is from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, it follows of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> feels the greatest pain when a hurt is inflicted on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself. That the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> suffers pain from the bodily fire is at present taken for granted, for we shall treat of this matter further on [Cf. Supplement, 70, 3]. Therefore it follows that the pain of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>, both of loss and of sense, surpasses all the pains of this life.

<p>Some, however, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> this from the fact that the whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is punished, and not the body. But this is to no purpose, since in that case the punishment of the damned would be milder after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> than before, which is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is less passive than the body, it is more cognizant of actual suffering [passionis]: and where the sense of suffering is greater, there is the greater pain, though the suffering be less.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The severity of that punishment is not so much a consequence of the degree of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as of the disposition of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> punished, because the same <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is more severely punished then than now. Even so a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who has a better temperament is punished more severely by the same sentence than another; and yet the judge acts <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> in condemning both for the same crimes to the same punishment.

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the Third Objection.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether this punishment is voluntary?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that this punishment is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. For those who are in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> are upright in heart. Now uprightness in heart is to conform one's will to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Serm. i in Ps. 32). Therefore, since it is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will that they be punished, they will suffer that punishment <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> wills that without which he cannot obtain the end he has in view. Now those who are in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they cannot obtain <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, unless they be punished first. Therefore they are punished willingly.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> No one asks to be freed from a punishment that he suffers willingly. Now those who are in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> ask to be set free, as appears from many incidents related in the Dialogue of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (iv, 40,65). Therefore they will not undergo that punishment <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing is said to be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> in two ways. First, by an absolute act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; and thus no punishment is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, because the very notion of punishment is that it be contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Secondly, a thing is said to be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> by a conditional act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: thus cautery is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> for the sake of regaining health. Hence a punishment may be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> in two ways. First, because by being punished we obtain some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and thus the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> itself undertakes a punishment, as instanced in satisfaction, or when a man accepts a punishment gladly, and would not have it not to be, as in the case of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. Secondly, when, although we gain no <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by the punishment, we cannot obtain a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> without being punished, as in the case of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> death: and then the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does not undertake the punishment, and would be delivered from it; but it submits to it, and in this respect the punishment is said to be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. In this latter sense the punishment of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> is said to be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>.

<p>Some, however, say that it is not voluntary in any way, because the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> are so replete with suffering, that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not that they are being cleansed by their pains, and deem themselves damned. But this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, for did they not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they will be set free, they would not ask for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, as they often do.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the souls in Purgatory are punished by the demons?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> are punished by the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; for, according to the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a>, "they will have for torturers in their pains, those who were their tempters in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." Now the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> tempt us to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, not only mortal, but also venial when they fail in the former. Therefore in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> also they will torture <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> on account of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the just are competent to be cleansed from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> both in this life and afterwards. Now, in this life, they are cleansed by pains inflicted by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, as was the case with Job. Therefore after this life also, those who have to be cleansed will be punished by the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It were <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> that he who has triumphed over someone, should be subjected to him after victory. Now those who are in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> have triumphed over the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, since they died without mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore they will not be subjected to them through being punished by them.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As after the Judgment day the Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> will kindle the fire with which the damned will be punished for ever, even so now the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> are cleansed after this life by the Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> alone, and neither by the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> whom they have vanquished, nor by the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who would not inflict such tortures on their fellow-citizens. It is, however, possible that they take them to the place of punishment: also that even the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, who rejoice in the punishment of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, accompany them and stand by while they are being cleansed, both that they may be sated with their pains, and that when these leave their bodies, they may find something of their own in them. But in this life, while there is yet time for the combat, men are punished both by the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">wicked angels</a> as foes, as instanced in Job, and by the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as instanced in <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, the sinew of whose thigh shrank at the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> touch [<a href="../bible/gen032.htm#verse25">Genesis 32:25</a>]. Moreover, <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says explicitly that the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> sometimes inflict punishment.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether venial sin is expiated by the pains of Purgatory as regards the guilt?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not expiated by the pains of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> as regards the guilt. For a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> [<a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a>, Moral. xvi, 28] on <a href="../bible/1jo005.htm#verse16">1 John 5:16</a>, "There is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> unto death," etc. says: "It is vain to ask pardon after death for what was not amended in this life." Therefore no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is remitted as to guilt after this life.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the same subject is freed from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as falls into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But after death the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> venially. Therefore neither can it be loosed from venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says [Dial. iv, 39] that every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will be at the judgment as he was when he left the body, because "the tree . . . wheresoever it shall fall, there shall it be" [<a href="../bible/ecc011.htm#verse3">Ecclesiastes 11:3</a>]. If, then, a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> go forth from this life with venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he will be with venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> at the judgment: and consequently one does not <a href="../cathen/02055a.htm">atone</a> for venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it has been stated (Supplement, 2, 3) that actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not blotted out save by <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>. But there will be no <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> after this life, because it is a <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> act. For then there will be neither <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> nor demerit since, according to the <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> [De Fide Orth. ii, 4], "death is to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> what the fall was to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>." Therefore, after this life, venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not remitted in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> as to its guilt.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not in us except on account of the fomes. Wherefore in the original state <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> would not have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> venially, as was stated (Sent. ii, D, xxi, 2). Now after this life there will be no sensuality; because the fomes will cease when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is separated, since it is called the "<a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the flesh" (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm">Romans 7</a>). Hence there will be no venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> then, and consequently it cannot be expiated by the fire of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> [Dial. iv, 39] and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [De vera et falsa poenit. iv, xviii, by some other author] say that certain slight <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> will be remitted in the life to come. Nor can this be understood of the punishment: because thus all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, however grave they be, are expiated by the fire of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>, as regards the debt of punishment. Therefore venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are cleansed by the fire of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> as to their guilt.

<p>Further, wood, hay, stubble (<a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 3:12</a>) denote venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as we have said (I-II, 89, 2). Now wood, hay, stubble are consumed in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>. Therefore venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are remitted after this life.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some have asserted that no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is remitted after this life, as regards the guilt: that if a man die with mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he is damned and incapable of being forgiven; and that it is not possible for a man to die with a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and without mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, since the final <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> washes the venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> away. They assign as reason for this that venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is excessive love of a temporal thing, in one who has his foundation in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which excess results from the corruption of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. Wherefore if <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> entirely overcome the corruption of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, as in the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, there is no room for venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Hence, since this <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is altogether abated and removed, the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are wholly subject to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is cast out. But this opinion is nonsensical in itself and in its <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>. In itself, because it is opposed to the statements of holy men and of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, which cannot be expounded as referring to the remission of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> as to their punishment, as the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> says in the text [Sentent. iv, D, xxi] because in this way both light and grave <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are remitted in the life to come: while <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> [Dial. iv, 39] declares that light <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> alone are remitted after this life. Nor does it suffice for them to say, that this is said expressly of light <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, lest we should think that we shall suffer nothing grievous on their account: because the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> diminishes punishment rather than aggravates it. As to the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, it is shown to be worthless, since bodily defect, such as obtains at the last moment of life, does not remove the corruption of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>; nor does it diminish it in its root but in its act, as instanced in those who lie dangerously ill; nor again does it calm the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, so as to subject them to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, because tranquillity of the powers, and their subjection to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, is effected when the lower powers obey the higher which delight together in <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">God's law</a>. But this cannot happen in that state, since the acts of both kinds of powers are impeded; unless tranquillity denote the absence of combat, as occurs even in those who are asleep; and yet sleep is not said, for this reason, to diminish <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, or to calm the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, or to subject them to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Moreover, granted that the aforesaid defect diminish <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> radically, and that it subject the powers to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, it would still be insufficient to wash away venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> already committed, although it would suffice in order to avoid it in the future. Because actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, even if it be venial, is not remitted without an actual movement of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, as stated above (Supplement, 2, 3), however much the latter be in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>. Now it happens sometimes that a man dies in his sleep, being in a state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a> and yet having a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> when he went to sleep: and such a man cannot make an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> for his venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> before he dies. Nor may we say, as they do, that if he repented neither by act nor by <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, neither in general nor in particular, his venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> becomes mortal, for that "venial becomes mortal when it is an object of complacency"; because not all complacency in venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> makes it mortal (else all venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> would be mortal, since every venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> pleases for as much as it is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>), but only that complacency which amounts to enjoyment, wherein all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> consists, in that "we enjoy what we should use," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says [De Trin. x, 10]. Hence the complacency which makes a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> mortal is actual complacency, for every mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> consists in an act. Now it may happen that a man, after committing a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, has no actual thought of being forgiven or of remaining in that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but thinks perhaps about a triangle having its three angles equal to two right angles, and while engaged in this thought falls asleep, and dies.

<p>It is therefore clear that this opinion is utterly unreasonable: and consequently we must say with others that venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in one who dies in a state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a>, is remitted after this life by the fire of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>: because this punishment so far as it is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, will have the power, by virtue of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, to expiate all such guilt as is compatible with <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. <span class="stiki"><a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> expresses himself differently, De Malo, 7, 2, ad 9,17: "Guilt is not remitted by punishment, but venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as to its guilt is remitted in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> by virtue of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, not only as existing in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, but also as proceeding to the act of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> in detestation of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>."</span>

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> refers to mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Or it may be replied that although, in this life, it is not amended in itself, it is amended in <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, because a man <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> here that his punishment should be <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> to him there.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> arises from the corruption of the fomes, which will no longer be in the separate <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that is in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>, wherefore this <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> venially. On the other hand, the remission of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> informed by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which will be in the separate <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>. Hence the comparison fails.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> do not alter a man's state, for they neither destroy nor diminish <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, according to which the amount of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is measured. Hence the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> remains such as it was before, notwithstanding the remission or commission of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> After this life there can be no <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> in respect of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward, but there can be in respect of some <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> reward, so long as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> remains in the state of the way, in a sense. Consequently in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> there can be a <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> act in respect of the remission of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Although venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> arises from the proneness of the fomes, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> results in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>; wherefore even when the fomes is no more, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can still remain.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the fire of Purgatory delivers from the debt of punishment?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the fire of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> does not deliver from the debt of punishment. For every cleansing is in respect of some uncleanness. But punishment does not imply uncleanness. Therefore the fire of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> does not deliver from punishment.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a contrary is not cleansed save by its contrary. But punishment is not contrary to punishment. Therefore one is not cleansed from the debt of punishment by the punishment of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse15">1 Corinthians 3:15</a>, "He shall be saved, yet so," etc. says: "This fire is the trial of tribulation of which it is written (<a href="../bible/sir027.htm#verse6">Sirach 27:6</a>): The furnace tries the potter's vessels," etc. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> expiates every punishment by the pains of this world, at least by death, which is the greatest punishment of all, and not by the fire of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The pains of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> are more grievous than all the pains of this world, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). Now the satisfactory punishment which one undergoes in this life <a href="../cathen/02055a.htm">atones</a> for the debt of punishment. Much more therefore is this effected by the punishment of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Whosoever is another's debtor, is freed from his indebtedness by paying the debt. And, since the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> incurred by guilt is nothing else than the debt of punishment, a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is freed from that <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> by undergoing the punishment which he owed. Accordingly the punishment of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> cleanses from the debt of punishment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although the debt of punishment does not in itself imply <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>, it bears a relation to <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> by reason of its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although punishment is not contrary to punishment, it is opposed to the debt of punishment, because the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to punishment remains from the fact that one has not undergone the punishment that was due.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Many meanings underlie the same words of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>. Hence this fire may denote both the present tribulation and the punishment to come, and venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> can be cleansed from both of these. That <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> death is not sufficient for this, has been stated above (Sent. iv, D, 20).

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether one person is delivered from this punishment sooner than another?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is not delivered from this punishment sooner than another. For the more grievous the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and the greater the debt, the more severely is it punished in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>. Now there is the same proportion between severer punishment and graver fault, as between lighter punishment and less grievous fault. Therefore one is delivered from this punishment as soon as another.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in point of duration unequal merits receive equal retribution both in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. Therefore seemingly it is the same in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> is the comparison of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>, who denotes the differences of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by wood, hay, and stubble. Now it is clear that wood remains longer in the fire than hay and stubble. Therefore one venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is punished longer in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> than another.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> cling more persistently than others, according as the affections are more inclined to them, and more firmly fixed in them. And since that which clings more persistently is more slowly cleansed, it follows that some are tormented in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> longer than others, for as much as their affections were steeped in venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Severity of punishment corresponds properly speaking to the amount of guilt: whereas the length corresponds to the firmness with which <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has taken root in its subject. Hence it may happen that one may be delayed longer who is tormented less, and "vice versa."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which deserves the punishment of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> which deserves the reward of heaven, will, after this life, be immovably rooted in their subject. Hence as to all there is the same duration in either case. It is otherwise with venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is punished in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>, as stated above (<a href="#6">Article 6</a>).
