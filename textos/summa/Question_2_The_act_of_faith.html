<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether to believe is to think with assent?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> is not to think with assent. Because the <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> word "cogitatio" [thought] implies a research, for "cogitare" [to think] seems to be equivalent to "coagitare," i.e. "to discuss together." Now <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iv) that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is "an assent without research." Therefore thinking has no place in the act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> resides in the reason, as we shall show further on (4, 2). Now to think is an act of the cogitative power, which belongs to the sensitive faculty, as stated in I, 78, 4. Therefore thought has nothing to do with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> is an act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, since its object is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But assent seems to be an act not of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, but of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, even as consent is, as stated above (I-II, 15, 1, ad 3). Therefore to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> is not to think with assent.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> This is how "to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>" is defined by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Praedest. Sanct. ii).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> "To think" can be taken in three ways. First, in a general way for any kind of actual consideration of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> observes (De Trin. xiv, 7): "By understanding I mean now the faculty whereby we understand when thinking." Secondly, "to think" is more strictly taken for that consideration of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which is accompanied by some kind of inquiry, and which precedes the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect's</a> arrival at the stage of perfection that comes with the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> of sight. On this sense <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xv, 16) that "the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is not called the Thought, but the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>. When our thought realizes what we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and takes form therefrom, it becomes our word. Hence the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> must be understood without any thinking on the part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for there is nothing there that can take form, or be unformed." In this way thought is, properly speaking, the movement of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> while yet deliberating, and not yet perfected by the clear sight of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Since, however, such a movement of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> may be one of deliberation either about universal notions, which belongs to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> faculty, or about particular matters, which belongs to the sensitive part, hence it is that "to think" is taken secondly for an act of the deliberating <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and thirdly for an act of the cogitative power.

<p>Accordingly, if "to think" be understood broadly according to the first sense, then "to think with assent," does not express completely what is meant by "to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>": since, in this way, a man thinks with assent even when he considers what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> by science [Science is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of a demonstrated conclusion through its demonstration.], or understands. If, on the other hand, "to think" be understood in the second way, then this expresses completely the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the act of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a>. For among the acts belonging to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, some have a firm assent without any such kind of thinking, as when a man considers the things that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> by science, or understands, for this consideration is already formed. But some acts of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> have unformed thought devoid of a firm assent, whether they incline to neither side, as in one who "<a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a>"; or incline to one side rather than the other, but on account of some slight motive, as in one who "suspects"; or incline to one side yet with fear of the other, as in one who "opines." But this act "to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>," cleaves firmly to one side, in which respect <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> has something in common with science and understanding; yet its <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> does not attain the perfection of clear sight, wherein it agrees with <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, suspicion and opinion. Hence it is proper to the believer to think with assent: so that the act of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> is distinguished from all the other acts of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which are about the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> or the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> has not that research of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> which demonstrates what is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, but a research into those things whereby a man is induced to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, for instance that such things have been uttered by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and confirmed by <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> "To think" is not taken here for the act of the cogitative power, but for an act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as explained above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of the believer is determined to one object, not by the reason, but by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, wherefore assent is taken here for an act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> as determined to one object by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the act of faith is suitably distinguished as believing God, believing in a God and believing in God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is unsuitably distinguished as <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> in a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For one <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> has but one act. Now <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is one <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> since it is one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore it is unreasonable to say that there are three acts of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which is common to all acts of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> should not be reckoned as a particular kind of act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Now "to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" is common to all acts of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, since <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is founded on the First Truth. Therefore it seems unreasonable to distinguish it from certain other acts of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that which can be said of unbelievers, cannot be called an act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Now unbelievers can be said to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore it should not be reckoned an act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, movement towards the end belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, whose object is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and the end. Now to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> is an act, not of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, but of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore "to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," which implies movement towards an end, should not be reckoned as a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of that act.

<p><strong>On the contrary</strong> is the authority of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> who makes this distinction (De Verb. Dom., Serm. lxi--Tract. xxix in Joan.).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The act of any power or <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> depends on the relation of that power or <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> to its object. Now the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> can be considered in three ways. For, since "to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>" is an act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, in so far as the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> moves it to assent, as stated above (1, ad 3), the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> can be considered either on the part of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, or on the part of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> that moves the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p>If it be considered on the part of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, then two things can be observed in the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as stated above (Question 1, Article 1). One of these is the material object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and in this way an act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is "to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>"; because, as stated above (Question 1, Article 1) nothing is proposed to our <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, except in as much as it is referred to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The other is the formal aspect of the object, for it is the medium on account of which we assent to such and such a point of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and thus an act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is "to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," since, as stated above (Question 1, Article 1) the formal object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the First Truth, to Which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> gives his adhesion, so as to assent to Its sake to whatever he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a>.

<p>Thirdly, if the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> be considered in so far as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is moved by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, an act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is "to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." For the First Truth is referred to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, through having the aspect of an end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> These three do not denote different acts of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but one and the same act having different relations to the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the Second Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Unbelievers cannot be said "to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" as we understand it in relation to the act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For they do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">God exists</a> under the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> determines; hence they do not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> imply <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> observes (Metaph. ix, text. 22) "to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> simple things defectively is not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them at all."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As stated above (I-II, 9, 1) the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> moves the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and the other powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the end: and in this respect an act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is "to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether it is necessary for salvation to believe anything above the natural reason?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem unnecessary for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> anything above the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and perfection of a thing seem to be sufficiently insured by its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> endowments. Now matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, surpass <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, since they are things unseen as stated above (Question 1, Article 4). Therefore to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> seems unnecessary for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is dangerous for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to assent to matters, wherein he cannot judge whether that which is proposed to him be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> or <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, according to <a href="../bible/job012.htm#verse11">Job 12:11</a>: "Doth not the ear discern words?" Now a man cannot form a judgment of this kind in matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, since he cannot trace them back to first principles, by which all our judgments are guided. Therefore it is dangerous to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in such matters. Therefore to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> rests on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa036.htm#verse39">Psalm 36:39</a>: "But the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the just is from the Lord." Now "the invisible things" of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made; His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> power also and Divinity," according to <a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse20">Romans 1:20</a>: and those things which are clearly seen by the understanding are not an object of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. Therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, that he should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> certain things.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse6">Hebrews 11:6</a>): "Without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> it is impossible to please <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Wherever one <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is subordinate to another, we find that two things concur towards the perfection of the lower <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, one of which is in respect of that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature's</a> proper movement, while the other is in respect of the movement of the higher <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Thus water by its proper movement moves towards the centre (of the earth), while according to the movement of the moon, it moves round the centre by ebb and flow. On like manner the planets have their proper movements from west to east, while in accordance with the movement of the first <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, they have a movement from east to west. Now the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> alone is immediately subordinate to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since other creatures do not attain to the universal, but only to something particular, while they partake of the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> either in "being" only, as inanimate things, or also in "living," and in "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> singulars," as plants and animals; whereas the rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, in as much as it apprehends the universal notion of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and being, is immediately related to the universal principle of being.

<p>Consequently the perfection of the rational creature consists not only in what belongs to it in respect of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but also in that which it acquires through a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> participation of Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Hence it was said above (I-II, 3, 8) that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> ultimate <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a>: to which vision <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot attain unless he be taught by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse45">John 6:45</a>: "Every one that hath heard of the Father and hath learned cometh to Me." Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> acquires a share of this learning, not indeed all at once, but by little and little, according to the mode of his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: and every one who learns thus must needs <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, in order that he may acquire science in a perfect degree; thus also the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> remarks (De Soph. Elench. i, 2) that "it behooves a learner to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>."

<p>Hence in order that a man arrive at the perfect vision of heavenly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, he must first of all <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as a disciple <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> the master who is teaching him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is dependent on a higher <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> does not suffice for its perfection, and some <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> assents to first principles, by the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> light of his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, so does a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, judge aright of things concerning that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and in this way, by the light of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> bestows on him, a man assents to matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and not to those which are against <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Consequently "there is no" danger or "condemnation to them that are in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>," and whom He has enlightened by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In many respects <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> perceives the invisible things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a higher way than <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> does in proceeding to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from His creatures. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/sir003.htm#verse25">Sirach 3:25</a>): "Many things are shown to thee above the understandings of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>."

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether it is necessary to believe those things which can be proved by natural reason?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem unnecessary to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> those things which can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. For nothing is superfluous in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> works, much less even than in the works of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now it is superfluous to employ other means, where one already suffices. Therefore it would be superfluous to receive by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, things that can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, those things must be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, which are the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Now science and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are not about the same object, as stated above (1, 4,5). Since therefore all things that can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> are an object of science, it seems that there is no need to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, all things knowable scientifically [Science is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of a demonstrated conclusion through its demonstration] would seem to come under one head: so that if some of them are proposed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as objects of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in like manner the others should also be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. But this is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> those things which can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is one and incorporeal: which things <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to accept by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> not only things which are above reason, but also those which can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by reason: and this for three motives. First, in order that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may arrive more quickly at the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Because the science to whose province it belongs to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is the last of all to offer itself to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> research, since it presupposes many other <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>: so that it would not by until late in life that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would arrive at the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The second reason is, in order that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may be more general. For many are unable to make progress in the study of science, either through dullness of mind, or through having a number of occupations, and temporal needs, or even through laziness in learning, all of whom would be altogether deprived of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, unless Divine things were brought to their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> under the guise of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The third reason is for the sake of <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a>. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> is very deficient in things concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. A sign of this is that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> in their researches, by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> investigation, into <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, have fallen into many <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, and have disagreed among themselves. And consequently, in order that men might have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, free of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> and uncertainty, it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for Divine matters to be delivered to them by way of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, being told to them, as it were, by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself Who cannot lie.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The researches of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> do not suffice <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> for the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Divine matters, even of those that can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by reason: and so it is not superfluous if these others be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Science and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> cannot be in the same subject and about the same object: but what is an object of science for one, can be an object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> for another, as stated above (Question 1, Article 5).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although all things that can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by science are of one common scientific aspect, they do not all alike lead <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to beatitude: hence they are not all equally proposed to our <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether man is bound to believe anything explicitly?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not bound to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> anything explicitly. For no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is bound to do what is not in his power. Now it is not in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> power to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> a thing explicitly, for it is written (<a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse14">Romans 10:14-15</a>): "How shall they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him, of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? And how shall they preach unless they be sent?" Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not bound to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> anything explicitly.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as we are directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so are we by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not bound to keep the precepts of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and it is enough if he be ready to fulfil them: as is evidenced by the precept of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse39">Matthew 5:39</a>): "If one strike thee on one [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'thy right'] cheek, turn to him also the other"; and by others of the same kind, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine's</a> exposition (De Serm. Dom. in Monte xix). Therefore neither is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> bound to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> anything explicitly, and it is enough if he be ready to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> whatever <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> proposes to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> consists in obedience, according to <a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse5">Romans 1:5</a>: "For obedience to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>." Now the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of obedience does not require <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to keep certain fixed precepts, but it is enough that his mind be ready to obey, according to <a href="../bible/psa118.htm#verse60">Psalm 118:60</a>: "I am ready and am not troubled; that I may keep Thy commandments." Therefore it seems enough for <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, too, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be ready to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> whatever <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may propose, without his <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> anything explicitly.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse6">Hebrews 11:6</a>): "He that cometh to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He is, and is a rewarder to them that seek Him."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is bound to fulfil, concern acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which are the means of attaining <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Now an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated above (I-II, 60, 5) depends on the relation of the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> to its object. Again two things may be considered in the object of any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; namely, that which is the proper and direct object of that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and that which is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> and consequent to the object properly so called. Thus it belongs properly and directly to the object of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, to face the dangers of death, and to charge at the foe with danger to oneself, for the sake of the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: yet that, in a just <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, a man be armed, or strike another with his sword, and so forth, is reduced to the object of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, but indirectly.

<p>Accordingly, just as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> act is required for the fulfilment of a precept, so is it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> act should terminate in its proper and direct object: but, on the other hand, the fulfilment of the precept does not require that a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> act should terminate in those things which have an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> or secondary relation to the proper and direct object of that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, except in certain places and at certain times. We must, therefore, say that the direct object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is that whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is made one of the Blessed, as stated above (Question 1, Article 8): while the indirect and secondary object comprises all things delivered by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to us in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>, for instance that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> had two sons, that David was the son of Jesse, and so forth.

<p>Therefore, as regards the primary points or <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is bound to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them, just as he is bound to have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; but as to other points of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not bound to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them explicitly, but only implicitly, or to be ready to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them, in so far as he is prepared to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> whatever is contained in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Divine Scriptures</a>. Then alone is he bound to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> such things explicitly, when it is clear to him that they are contained in the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> If we understand those things alone to be in a man's power, which we can do without the help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, then we are bound to do many things which we cannot do without the aid of healing <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, such as to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and our neighbor, and likewise to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a>. But with the help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> we can do this, for this help "to whomsoever it is given from above it is mercifully given; and from whom it is withheld it is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> withheld, as a punishment of a previous, or at least of original, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Corr. et Grat. v, vi [Cf. Ep. cxc; De Praed. Sanct. viii.]).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> is bound to love definitely those lovable things which are properly and directly the objects of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, namely, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and our neighbor. The objection refers to those precepts of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> which belong, as a consequence, to the objects of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of obedience is seated, properly speaking, in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; hence promptness of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> subject to authority, suffices for the act of obedience, because it is the proper and direct object of obedience. But this or that precept is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> or consequent to that proper and direct object.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether all are equally bound to have explicit faith?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that all are equally bound to have explicit <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For all are bound to those things which are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, as is evidenced by the precepts of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Now it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> that certain things should be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> explicitly. Therefore all are equally bound to have explicit <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no one should be put to test in matters that he is not bound to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. But simple reasons are sometimes tested in reference to the slightest <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a>. Therefore all are bound to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> everything explicitly.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if the simple are bound to have, not explicit but only implicit <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> must needs be implied in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the learned. But this seems unsafe, since it is possible for the learned to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>. Therefore it seems that the simple should also have explicit <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; so that all are, therefore, equally bound to have explicit <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/job001.htm#verse14">Job 1:14</a>): "The oxen were ploughing, and the asses feeding beside them," because, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> expounds this passage (Moral. ii, 17), the simple, who are signified by the asses, ought, in matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, to stay by the learned, who are denoted by the oxen.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The unfolding of matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the result of Divine <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>: for matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> surpass <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Now Divine <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> reaches those of lower degree through those who are over them, in a certain order; to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, for instance, through the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and to the lower <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> through the higher, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> explains (Coel. Hier. iv, vii). On like manner therefore the unfolding of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> must needs reach men of lower degree through those of higher degree. Consequently, just as the higher <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who enlighten those who are below them, have a fuller <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Divine things than the lower <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> states (Coel. Hier. xii), so too, men of higher degree, whose business it is to teach others, are under <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to have fuller <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them more explicitly.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The unfolding of the <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a> is not equally <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of all, since those of higher degree, whose <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> it is to teach others, are bound to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> explicitly more things than others are.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Simple <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> should not be put to the test about subtle questions of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, unless they be suspected of having been corrupted by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who are wont to corrupt the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of simple people in such questions. If, however, it is found that they are free from obstinacy in their heterodox sentiments, and that it is due to their simplicity, it is no fault of theirs.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The simple have no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> implied in that of the learned, except in so far as the latter adhere to the Divine teaching. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse16">1 Corinthians 4:16</a>): "Be ye followers of me, as I also am of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." Hence it is not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but the Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that is the rule of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: and if any of the learned stray from this rule, he does not harm the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the simple ones, who think that the learned <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> aright; unless the simple hold obstinately to their <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, against the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">universal</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which cannot <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse32">Luke 22:32</a>): "I have <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for thee," <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, "that thy <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> fail not."

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether it is necessary for the salvation of all, that they should believe explicitly in the mystery of Christ?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of all that they should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> explicitly in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not bound to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> explicitly what the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> about: since the unfolding of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the result of Divine <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>, which reaches <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by means of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as stated above (6; I, 111, 1). Now even the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>: hence, according to the commentary of <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Coel. Hier. vii), it is they who ask (<a href="../bible/psa023.htm#verse8">Psalm 23:8</a>): "Who is this king of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>?" and (<a href="../bible/isa063.htm#verse1">Isaiah 63:1</a>): "Who is this that cometh from Edom?" Therefore men were not bound to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> explicitly in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is evident that <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a> was one of the teachers, and most nigh to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who said of him (<a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse11">Matthew 11:11</a>) that "there hath not risen among them that are born of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, a greater than" he. Now <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a> does not appear to have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> explicitly, since he asked <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse3">Matthew 11:3</a>): "Art Thou He that art to come, or look we for another?" Therefore even the teachers were not bound to explicit <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, many gentiles obtained <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> through the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> states (Coel. Hier. ix). Now it would seem that the gentiles had neither explicit nor implicit <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, since they received no <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>. Therefore it seems that it was not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of all to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> explicitly in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Corr. et Gratia vii; Ep. cxc): "Our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is sound if we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, old or young is delivered from the contagion of death and the bonds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, except by the one Mediator of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and men, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (5; 1, 8), the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> includes, properly and directly, that thing through which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> obtains beatitude. Now the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> and <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> is the way by which men obtain beatitude; for it is written (<a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse12">Acts 4:12</a>): "There is no other name under <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> given to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, whereby we must be saved." Therefore <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> of some kind in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> at all times and for all <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, but this <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> differed according to differences of times and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. The reason of this is that before the state of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, explicitly in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, in so far as it was intended for the consummation of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, but not as it was intended to deliver <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> and <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had no foreknowledge of his future <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. He does, however, seem to have had foreknowledge of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, from the fact that he said (<a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse24">Genesis 2:24</a>): "Wherefore a man shall leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife," of which the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse32">Ephesians 5:32</a>) that "this is a great sacrament . . . in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>," and it is incredible that the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> about this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p>But after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> explicitly in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, not only as to the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, but also as to the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> and <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, whereby the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> is delivered from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and death: for they would not, else, have foreshadowed <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> by certain <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> both before and after the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, the meaning of which <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the learned explicitly, while the simple folk, under the veil of those <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> them to be ordained by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in reference to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> coming, and thus their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> was covered with a veil, so to speak. And, as stated above (Question 1, Article 7), the nearer they were to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the more distinct was their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> mysteries.

<p>After <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> had been revealed, both learned and simple folk are bound to explicit <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the mysteries of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, chiefly as regards those which are observed throughout the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and publicly proclaimed, such as the articles which refer to the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, of which we have spoken above (Question 1, Article 8). As to other minute points in reference to the articles of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, men have been bound to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them more or less explicitly according to each one's state and office.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a> was not entirely hidden from the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> observes (Gen. ad lit. v, 19), yet certain aspects thereof were better <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to them when Christ revealed them to them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It was not through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> that <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a> inquired of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> advent in the flesh, since he had clearly professed his <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> therein, saying: "I saw, and I gave testimony, that this is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>" (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse34">John 1:34</a>). Hence he did not say: "Art Thou He that hast come?" but "Art Thou He that art to come?" thus saying about the future, not about the past. Likewise it is not to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that he was <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> future <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, for he had already said (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse39">John 1:39</a>): "Behold the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, behold Him who taketh away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: '<a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>'] of the world," thus foretelling His future immolation; and since other <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> had foretold it, as may be seen especially in <a href="../bible/isa053.htm">Isaias 53</a>. We may therefore say with <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Hom. xxvi in Evang.) that he asked this question, being in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> as to whether <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> would descend into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> in His own Person. But he did not ignore the fact that the power of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> would be extended to those who were detained in <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">Limbo</a>, according to <a href="../bible/zec009.htm#verse11">Zechariah 9:11</a>: "Thou also, by the blood of Thy testament hast sent forth Thy prisoners out of the pit, wherein there is no water"; nor was he bound to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> explicitly, before its fulfilment, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was to descend thither Himself.

<p>It may also be replied that, as <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> observes in his commentary on <a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse19">Luke 7:19</a>, he made this inquiry, not from <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> or <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> but from devotion: or again, with <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> (Hom. xxxvi in Matth.), that he inquired, not as though <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> himself, but because he wished his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to be satisfied on that point, through Christ: hence the latter framed His answer so as to instruct the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, by pointing to the signs of His works.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Many of the gentiles received <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelations</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as is clear from their predictions. Thus we read (<a href="../bible/job019.htm#verse25">Job 19:25</a>): "I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that my Redeemer liveth." The Sibyl too foretold certain things about <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (Contra Faust. xiii, 15). Moreover, we read in the history of the Romans, that at the time of Constantine Augustus and his mother Irene a tomb was discovered, wherein lay a man on whose breast was a golden plate with the inscription: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> shall be born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, and in Him, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. O sun, during the lifetime of Irene and Constantine, thou shalt see me again" [Cf. Baron, Annal., A.D. 780. If, however, some were saved without receiving any <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>, they were not saved without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in a Mediator, for, though they did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him explicitly, they did, nevertheless, have implicit <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> through <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> in <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a>, since they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would deliver <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> in whatever way was pleasing to Him, and according to the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> to those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as stated in <a href="../bible/job035.htm#verse11">Job 35:11</a>: "Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth."

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether it is necessary for salvation to believe explicitly in the Trinity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it was not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> explicitly in the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse6">Hebrews 11:6</a>): "He that cometh to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He is, and is a rewarder to them that seek Him." Now one can <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> this without <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse17">John 17:5-6</a>): "Father, I have manifested Thy name to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>," which words <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> expounds (Tract. cvi) as follows: "Not the name by which Thou art called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but the name whereby Thou art called My Father," and further on he adds: "In that He made this world, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>; in that He is not to be worshipped together with <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> gods, '<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in Judea'; but, in that He is the Father of this <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, through Whom He takes away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the world, He now makes <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> this name of His, which hitherto they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not." Therefore before the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> it was not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that Paternity and Filiation were in the Godhead: and so the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> was not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> explicitly.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that which we are bound to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> explicitly of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the object of heavenly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Now the object of heavenly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is the sovereign <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which can be understood to be in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, without any distinction of Persons. Therefore it was not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> explicitly in the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> of Persons is expressed in many ways; thus at the very outset of Genesis it is written in manifestation of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>: "Let us make <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to Our image and likeness" (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis 1:26</a>). Therefore from the very beginning it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is impossible to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> explicitly in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> includes that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> took flesh; that He renewed the world through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; and again, that He was conceived by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Wherefore just as, before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> explicitly by the learned, but implicitly and under a veil, so to speak, by the simple, so too was it with the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>. And consequently, when once <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> had been revealed, all were bound to explicit <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>: and all who are born again in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, have this bestowed on them by the invocation of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew 28:19</a>: "Going therefore teach ye all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> them in the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Explicit <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in those two things was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> at all times and for all people: but it was not sufficient at all times and for all people.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Before Christ's coming, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> lay hidden in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the learned, but through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> it was shown to the world.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sovereign <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> as we understand it now through its effects, can be understood without the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> of Persons: but as understood in itself, and as seen by the Blessed, it cannot be understood without the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> of Persons. Moreover the mission of the Divine Persons brings us to heavenly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether to believe is meritorious?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>. For the principle of all <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as stated above (I-II, 114, 4). Now <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, like <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, is a preamble to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore, just as an act of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>, since we do not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> by our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, so neither is an act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> is a mean between opinion and scientific <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or the consideration of things scientifically <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> [Science is a certain <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of a demonstrated conclusion through its demonstration.]. Now the considerations of science are not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>, nor on the other hand is opinion. Therefore <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> is not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, he who assents to a point of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, either has a sufficient motive for <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a>, or he has not. If he has a sufficient motive for his <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, this does not seem to imply any <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> on his part, since he is no longer free to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> or not to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>: whereas if he has not a sufficient motive for <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a>, this is a mark of levity, according to <a href="../bible/sir019.htm#verse4">Sirach 19:4</a>: "He that is hasty to give credit, is light of heart," so that, seemingly, he gains no <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> thereby. Therefore to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> is by no means <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse33">Hebrews 11:33</a>) that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> "by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> . . . obtained promises," which would not be the case if they did not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> by <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a>. Therefore to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> is <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (I-II, 114, 3,4), our actions are <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> in so far as they proceed from the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> moved with <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore every <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a> proceeding from the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, if it be referred to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, can be <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>. Now the act of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> is an act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> assenting to the Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> at the command of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> moved by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so that it is subject to the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> in relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and consequently the act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> can be <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> is compared to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> which is the principle of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, as <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to form: whereas <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is compared to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> as the disposition which precedes the ultimate form. Now it is evident that the subject or the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> cannot act save by virtue of the form, nor can a preceding disposition, before the advent of the form: but after the advent of the form, both the subject and the preceding disposition act by virtue of the form, which is the chief principle of action, even as the heat of fire acts by virtue of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form of fire. Accordingly neither <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> nor <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> can, without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, produce a <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> act; but, when accompanied by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, the act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is made <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> thereby, even as an act of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> act of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Two things may be considered in science: namely the scientist's assent to a scientific fact and his consideration of that fact. Now the assent of science is not subject to <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, because the scientist is <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to assent by force of the demonstration, wherefore scientific assent is not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>. But the actual consideration of what a man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> scientifically is subject to his <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, for it is in his power to consider or not to consider. Hence scientific consideration may be <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> if it be referred to the end of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, i.e. to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of our neighbor. On the other hand, in the case of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, both these things are subject to the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> so that in both respects the act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> can be <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>: whereas in the case of opinion, there is no firm assent, since it is weak and infirm, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> observes (Poster. i, 33), so that it does not seem to proceed from a perfect act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: and for this reason, as regards the assent, it does not appear to be very <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>, though it can be as regards the actual consideration.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The believer has sufficient motive for <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a>, for he is moved by the authority of Divine teaching confirmed by <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and, what is more, by the inward instinct of the Divine invitation: hence he does not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> lightly. He has not, however, sufficient reason for scientific <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, hence he does not lose the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>.

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether reasons in support of what we believe lessen the merit of faith?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that reasons in support of what we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> lessen the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xxvi in Evang.) that "there is no <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> in <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> what is shown by reason." If, therefore, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> provides sufficient <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is altogether taken away. Therefore it seems that any kind of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> reasoning in support of matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, diminishes the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever lessens the measure of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, lessens the amount of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, since "<a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is the reward of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. i, 9). Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> reasoning seems to diminish the measure of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, since it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to be about the unseen, as stated above (1, 4,5). Now the more a thing is supported by reasons the less is it unseen. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> reasons in support of matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> diminish the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, contrary things have contrary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. Now an inducement in opposition to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> increases the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> whether it consist in <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> inflicted by one who endeavors to force a man to renounce his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or in an argument persuading him to do so. Therefore reasons in support of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> diminish the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/1pe003.htm#verse15">1 Peter 3:15</a>): "Being ready always to satisfy every one that asketh you a reason of that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Of that hope which is in you.' <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>' reading is apparently taken from <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>.] and hope which is in you." Now the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> would not give this advice, if it would imply a diminution in the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Therefore reason does not diminish the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#9">Article 9</a>), the act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> can be <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>, in so far as it is subject to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, not only as to the use, but also as to the assent. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> in support of what we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, may stand in a twofold relation to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the believer. First, as preceding the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; as, for instance, when a man either has not the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, or not a prompt will, to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, unless he be moved by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> reasons: and in this way <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> diminishes the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. On this sense it has been said above (I-II, 24, 3, ad 1; 77, 6, ad 2) that, in moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> which precedes choice makes the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> act less praiseworthy. For just as a man ought to perform acts of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, on account of the judgment of his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, and not on account of a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, so ought he to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, not on account of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, but on account of the Divine authority. Secondly, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> reasons may be consequent to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the believer. For when a man's <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is ready to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, he loves the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a>, he thinks out and takes to heart whatever reasons he can find in support thereof; and in this way <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> does not exclude the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> but is a sign of greater <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. Thus again, in moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> a consequent passion is the sign of a more prompt will, as stated above (I-II, 24, 3, ad 1). We have an indication of this in the words of the Samaritans to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, who is a type of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>: "We now <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, not for thy saying" (<a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse42">John 4:42</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> is referring to the case of a man who has no will to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what is of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, unless he be induced by reasons. But when a man has the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what is of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> on the authority of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, although he may have reasons in demonstration of some of them, e.g. of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not, for that reason, lost or diminished.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The reasons which are brought forward in support of the authority of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, are not demonstrations which can bring <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> vision to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, wherefore they do not cease to be unseen.

<p>But they remove obstacles to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, by showing that what <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> proposes is not impossible; wherefore such reasons do not diminish the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> or the measure of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. On the other hand, though demonstrative reasons in support of the preambles of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> [The Leonine Edition reads: 'in support of matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which are however, preambles to the <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a>, diminish,' etc.], but not of the <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a>, diminish the measure of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, since they make the thing <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be seen, yet they do not diminish the measure of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which makes the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> ready to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them, even if they were unseen; and so the measure of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> is not diminished.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Whatever is in opposition to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, whether it consist in a man's thoughts, or in outward <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, increases the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in so far as the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is shown to be more prompt and firm in <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> had more <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, through not renouncing <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> on account of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>; and even the wise have greater <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, through not renouncing their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> on account of the reasons brought forward by <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> or <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in opposition to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. On the other hand things that are favorable to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, do not always diminish the promptness of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and therefore they do not always diminish the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.
