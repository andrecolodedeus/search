<h1>Question 2. The existence of God</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1002.htm#article1"> Is the proposition "God exists" self-evident?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1002.htm#article2"> Is it demonstrable?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1002.htm#article3"> Does God exist?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the existence of God is self-evident?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a> is self-evident. Now those things are said to be self-evident to us the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> implanted in us, as we can see in regard to first principles. But as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. i, 1,3), "the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> implanted in all." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a> is self-evident.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, those things are said to be self-evident which are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as soon as the terms are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (1 Poster. iii) says is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the first principles of demonstration. Thus, when the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a whole and of a part is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, it is at once recognized that every whole is greater than its part. But as soon as the signification of the word "God" is understood, it is at once seen that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">exists</a>. For by this word is signified that thing than which nothing greater can be conceived. But that which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> actually and mentally is greater than that which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> only mentally. Therefore, since as soon as the word "God" is understood it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> mentally, it also follows that it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> actually. Therefore the proposition <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">"God exists"</a> is self-evident.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is self-evident. For whoever denies the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> grants that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>: and, if <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, then the proposition "<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">Truth</a> does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>" is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: and if there is anything <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, there must be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself: "I am the way, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the life" (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John 14:6</a>) Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">"God exists"</a> is self-evident.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> No one can <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mentally</a> admit the opposite of what is self-evident; as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. iv, lect. vi) states concerning the first principles of demonstration. But the opposite of the proposition <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">"God is"</a> can be <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mentally</a> admitted: "The fool said in his heart, <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">There is no God</a>" (<a href="../bible/psa052.htm#verse1">Psalm 52:1</a>). Therefore, that <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">God exists</a> is not self-evident.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing can be self-evident in either of two ways: on the one hand, self-evident in itself, though not to us; on the other, self-evident in itself, and to us. A proposition is self-evident because the predicate is included in the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the subject, as "Man is an animal," for animal is contained in the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. If, therefore the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the predicate and subject be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all, the proposition will be self-evident to all; as is clear with regard to the first principles of demonstration, the terms of which are common things that no one is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of, such as being and non-being, whole and part, and such like. If, however, there are some to whom the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the predicate and subject is unknown, the proposition will be self-evident in itself, but not to those who do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the meaning of the predicate and subject of the proposition. Therefore, it happens, as <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (Hebdom., the title of which is: "Whether all that is, is good"), "that there are some <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> concepts self-evident only to the learned, as that <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">incorporeal substances</a> are not in <a href="../cathen/14167a.htm">space</a>." Therefore I say that this proposition, "<a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">God exists</a>," of itself is self-evident, for the predicate is the same as the subject, because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is His own <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence</a> as will be hereafter shown (3, 4). Now because we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the proposition is not self-evident to us; but needs to be demonstrated by things that are more <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us, though less <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> &mdash; namely, by effects.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> To <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">God exists</a> in a general and confused way is implanted in us by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> beatitude. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> desires <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, and what is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> desired by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> must be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to him. This, however, is not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> absolutely that <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">God exists</a>; just as to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that someone is approaching is not the same as to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that Peter is approaching, even though it is Peter who is approaching; for many there are who <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, consists in <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, and others in pleasures, and others in something else.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Perhaps not everyone who hears this word "God" understands it to signify something than which nothing greater can be thought, seeing that some have believed <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be a body. Yet, granted that everyone understands that by this word "God" is signified something than which nothing greater can be thought, nevertheless, it does not therefore follow that he understands that what the word signifies <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> actually, but only that it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mentally</a>. Nor can it be argued that it actually <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>, unless it be admitted that there actually <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> something than which nothing greater can be thought; and this precisely is not admitted by those who hold that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in general is self-evident but the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of a Primal Truth is not self-evident to us.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether it can be demonstrated that God exists?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a> cannot be demonstrated. For it is an <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">article of faith</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">God exists</a>. But what is of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> cannot be demonstrated, because a demonstration produces scientific <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; whereas <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is of the unseen (<a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse1">Hebrews 11:1</a>). Therefore it cannot be demonstrated that <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">God exists</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is the middle term of demonstration. But we cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> consists, but solely in what it does not consist; as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. i, 4). Therefore we cannot demonstrate that <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">God exists</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a> were demonstrated, this could only be from His effects. But His effects are not proportionate to Him, since He is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> and His effects are finite; and between the finite and <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> there is no proportion. Therefore, since a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> cannot be demonstrated by an effect not proportionate to it, it seems that the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a> cannot be demonstrated.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says: "The invisible things of Him are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">made</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse20">Romans 1:20</a>). But this would not be unless the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a> could be demonstrated through the things that are <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">made</a>; for the first thing we must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of anything is whether it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Demonstration can be made in two ways: One is through the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and is called "a priori," and this is to argue from what is prior absolutely. The other is through the effect, and is called a demonstration "a posteriori"; this is to argue from what is prior relatively only to us. When an effect is better <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us than its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, from the effect we proceed to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. And from every effect the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of its proper <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> can be demonstrated, so long as its effects are better <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us; because since every effect depends upon its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, if the effect <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> must pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a>, in so far as it is not self-evident to us, can be demonstrated from those of His effects which are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a> and other like <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, are not <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a>, but are preambles to the <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles</a>; for <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> presupposes <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, even as <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> presupposes <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and perfection supposes something that can be perfected. Nevertheless, there is nothing to prevent a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who cannot grasp a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, accepting, as a matter of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, something which in itself is capable of being scientifically <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and demonstrated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is demonstrated from an effect, this effect takes the place of the definition of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. This is especially the case in regard to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because, in order to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of anything, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to accept as a middle term the meaning of the word, and not its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, for the question of its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> follows on the question of its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. Now the names given to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are derived from His effects; consequently, in demonstrating the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a> from His effects, we may take for the middle term the meaning of the word "God".

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> From effects not proportionate to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> no perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> can be obtained. Yet from every effect the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> can be clearly demonstrated, and so we can demonstrate the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a> from His effects; though from them we cannot perfectly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as He is in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether God exists?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">exist</a>; because if one of two contraries be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, the other would be altogether destroyed. But the word "God" means that He is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. If, therefore, <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">God existed</a>, there would be no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> discoverable; but there is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the world. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">exist</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is superfluous to suppose that what can be accounted for by a few principles has been produced by many. But it seems that everything we see in the world can be accounted for by other principles, supposing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> did not <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">exist</a>. For all <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things can be reduced to one principle which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and all <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> things can be reduced to one principle which is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, or <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore there is no need to suppose <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">God's existence</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said in the person of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: "I am Who am." (<a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse14">Exodus 3:14</a>)

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a> can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in five ways.

<p>The first and more manifest way is the argument from motion. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>, and evident to our senses, that in the world some things are in motion. Now whatever is in motion is put in motion by another, for nothing can be in motion except it is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to that towards which it is in motion; whereas a thing moves inasmuch as it is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">act</a>. For motion is nothing else than the reduction of something from <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a>. But nothing can be reduced from <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a>, except by something in a state of <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a>. Thus that which is <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">actually</a> hot, as fire, makes wood, which is <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a> hot, to be <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">actually</a> hot, and thereby moves and changes it. Now it is not possible that the same thing should be at once in <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a> and <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> in the same respect, but only in different respects. For what is <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actually</a> hot cannot simultaneously be <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">potentially</a> hot; but it is simultaneously <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">potentially</a> cold. It is therefore impossible that in the same respect and in the same way a thing should be both mover and moved, i.e. that it should move itself. Therefore, whatever is in motion must be put in motion by another. If that by which it is put in motion be itself put in motion, then this also must needs be put in motion by another, and that by another again. But this cannot go on to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>, because then there would be no first mover, and, consequently, no other mover; seeing that subsequent movers move only inasmuch as they are put in motion by the first mover; as the staff moves only because it is put in motion by the hand. Therefore it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to arrive at a first mover, put in motion by no other; and this everyone understands to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>The second way is from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. In the world of sense we find there is an order of efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. There is no case <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> (neither is it, indeed, possible) in which a thing is found to be the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of itself; for so it would be prior to itself, which is impossible. Now in efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> it is not possible to go on to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>, because in all efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> following in order, the first is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the intermediate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and the intermediate is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the ultimate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, whether the intermediate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> be several, or only one. Now to take away the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is to take away the effect. Therefore, if there be no first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> among efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, there will be no ultimate, nor any intermediate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But if in efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> it is possible to go on to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>, there will be no first efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, neither will there be an ultimate effect, nor any intermediate efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>; all of which is plainly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Therefore it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to admit a first efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, to which everyone gives the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>The third way is taken from possibility and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, and runs thus. We find in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> things that are possible to be and not to be, since they are found to be generated, and to corrupt, and consequently, they are possible to be and not to be. But it is impossible for these always to exist, for that which is possible not to be at some time is not. Therefore, if everything is possible not to be, then at one time there could have been nothing in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. Now if this were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, even now there would be nothing in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, because that which does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> only begins to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> by something already <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a>. Therefore, if at one time nothing was in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, it would have been impossible for anything to have begun to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>; and thus even now nothing would be in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> &mdash; which is absurd. Therefore, not all beings are merely possible, but there must <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> something the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of which is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. But every <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> thing either has its <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by another, or not. Now it is impossible to go on to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> in <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> things which have their <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by another, as has been already <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in regard to efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. Therefore we cannot but postulate the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of some being having of itself its own <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, and not receiving it from another, but rather causing in others their <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. This all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> speak of as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>The fourth way is taken from the gradation to be found in things. Among beings there are some more and some less <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, noble and the like. But "more" and "less" are predicated of different things, according as they resemble in their different ways something which is the maximum, as a thing is said to be hotter according as it more nearly resembles that which is hottest; so that there is something which is truest, something best, something noblest and, consequently, something which is uttermost being; for those things that are greatest in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> are greatest in being, as it is written in Metaph. ii. Now the maximum in any genus is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all in that genus; as fire, which is the maximum heat, is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all hot things. Therefore there must also be something which is to all beings the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of their being, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, and every other perfection; and this we call <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>The fifth way is taken from the governance of the world. We see that things which lack <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>, such as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> bodies, act for an end, and this is evident from their acting always, or nearly always, in the same way, so as to obtain the best result. Hence it is plain that not fortuitously, but designedly, do they achieve their end. Now whatever lacks <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> cannot move towards an end, unless it be directed by some being endowed with <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>; as the arrow is shot to its mark by the archer. Therefore some <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> being <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> by whom all <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things are directed to their end; and this being we call <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion xi): "Since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">highest good</a>, He would not allow any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in His works, unless His <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotence</a> and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> were such as to bring <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> even out of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." This is part of the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that He should allow <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, and out of it produce <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> works for a determinate end under the direction of a higher agent, whatever is done by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> must needs be traced back to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as to its first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. So also whatever is done voluntarily must also be traced back to some higher <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> other than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> or <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, since these can change or fail; for all things that are changeable and capable of defect must be traced back to an immovable and self-necessary first principle, as was shown in the body of the Article.
