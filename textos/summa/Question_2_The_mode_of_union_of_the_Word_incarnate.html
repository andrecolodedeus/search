<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the Union of Incarnate Word took place in the nature?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the Union of the Word Incarnate took place in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For Cyril says (he is quoted in the acts of the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>, part ii, act. 1): "We must understand not two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, but one <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>"; and this could not be unless the union took place in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore the union of the Word Incarnate took place in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> says that, as the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the flesh together form the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, so <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> together form a certain one <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; therefore the union took place in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, of two natures one is not denominated by the other unless they are to some extent mutually transmuted. But the Divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> natures in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> are denominated one by the other; for Cyril says (quoted in the acts of the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>, part ii, act. 1) that the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> "is <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>"; and <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory Nazianzen</a> says (Ep. i ad Cledon.) that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is "deified," as appears from <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. iii, 6,11). Therefore from two natures one seems to have resulted.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said in the declaration of the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>: "We confess that in these latter times the only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> appeared in two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, without confusion, without change, without division, without separation--the distinction of natures not having been taken away by the union." Therefore the union did not take place in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> To make this question clear we must consider what is "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." Now it is to be observed that the word "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>" comes from nativity. Hence this word was used first of all to signify the begetting of living beings, which is called "birth" or "sprouting forth," the word "natura" meaning, as it were, "nascitura." Afterwards this word "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>" was taken to signify the principle of this begetting; and because in living things the principle of generation is an intrinsic principle, this word "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>" was further employed to signify any intrinsic principle of motion: thus the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Phys. ii) that "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is the principle of motion in that in which it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> and not <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>." Now this principle is either form or <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Hence sometimes form is called <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and sometimes <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. And because the end of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> generation, in that which is generated, is the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, which the definition signifies, this <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is called the "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." And thus <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> defines <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> (De Duab. Nat.): "Nature is what informs a thing with its specific difference,"--i.e. which perfects the specific definition. But we are now speaking of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as it signifies the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, or the "what-it-is," or the quiddity of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p>Now, if we take <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in this way, it is impossible that the union of Incarnate Word took place in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For one thing is made of two or more in three ways. First, from two complete things which remain in their perfection. This can only happen to those whose form is composition, order, or figure, as a heap is made up of many stones brought together without any order, but solely with juxtaposition; and a house is made of stones and beams arranged in order, and fashioned to a figure. And in this way some said the union was by manner of confusion (which is without order) or by manner of commensuration (which is with order). But this cannot be. First, because neither composition nor order nor figure is a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form, but <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>; and hence it would follow that the union of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> was not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a>, but <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>, which will be disproved later on (6). Secondly, because thereby we should not have an absolute unity, but relative only, for there remain several things actually. Thirdly, because the form of such is not a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but an art, as the form of a house; and thus one <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> would not be constituted in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as they wish.

<p>Secondly, one thing is made up of several things, perfect but changed, as a mixture is made up of its elements; and in this way some have said that the union of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> was brought about by manner of combination. But this cannot be. First, because the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> is altogether immutable, as has been said (I, 9, 1; I, 9, 2), hence neither can it be changed into something else, since it is incorruptible; nor can anything else be changed into it, for it cannot be generated. Secondly, because what is mixed is of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> with none of the elements; for flesh differs in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from any of its elements. And thus <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> would be of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> neither with His Father nor with His Mother. Thirdly, because there can be no mingling of things widely apart; for the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of one of them is absorbed, e.g. if we were to put a drop of water in a flagon of wine. And hence, since the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> exceeds the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, there could be no mixture, but the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> alone would remain.

<p>Thirdly, a thing is made up of things not mixed nor changed, but imperfect; as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is made up of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, and likewise of divers members. But this cannot be said of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>. First, because each <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, i.e. the Divine and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, has its specific perfection. Secondly, because the Divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> natures cannot constitute anything after the manner of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantitative</a> parts, as the members make up the body; for the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> is incorporeal; nor after the manner of form and <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, for the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> cannot be the form of anything, especially of anything corporeal, since it would follow that the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> resulting therefrom would be communicable to several, and thus there would be several Christs. Thirdly, because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> would <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> neither in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> nor in the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>: since any difference varies the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as unity varies number, as is said (Metaph. viii, text. 10).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This authority of Cyril is expounded in the Fifth Synod (i.e. <a href="../cathen/04308b.htm">Constantinople II</a>, coll. viii, can. 8) thus: "If anyone proclaiming one <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> to be <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a> does not receive it as the Fathers taught, viz. that from the Divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> natures (a union in subsistence having taken place) one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> results, but endeavors from these words to introduce one <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the Divinity and flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, let such a one be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>." Hence the sense is not that from two natures one results; but that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> united flesh to Itself in Person.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> From the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body a double unity, viz. of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>--results in each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>--of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united to the body, and formally perfects it, so that one <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> springs from the two as from act and <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> or from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. But the comparison is not in this sense, for the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> cannot be the form of a body, as was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> (I, 3, 8). Unity of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> results from them, however, inasmuch as there is an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> subsisting in flesh and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and herein lies the likeness, for the one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> subsists in the Divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 6,11), the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> is said to be <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a> because It is united to flesh personally, and not that It is changed into flesh. So likewise the flesh is said to be deified, as he also says (De Fide Orth. 15,17), not by change, but by union with the Word, its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> properties still remaining, and hence it may be considered as deified, inasmuch as it becomes the flesh of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, but not that it becomes <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the union of Incarnate Word took place in the Person?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the union of Incarnate Word did not take place in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. For the Person of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not distinct from His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, as we said (I, 39, 1). If, therefore, the union did not take place in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it follows that it did not take place in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> has no less dignity than ours. But personality belongs to dignity, as was stated above (I, 29, 3, ad 2). Hence, since our <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> has its proper personality, much more reason was there that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> should have its proper personality.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Duab. Nat.), a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> assumed an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, for "universal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> of itself, but is the object of pure thought," as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 11). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has its personality. Hence it does not seem that the union took place in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> We read in the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Synod of Chalcedon</a> (Part ii, act. 5): "We confess that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> is not parted or divided into two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, but is one and the same only-Begotten Son and Word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore the union took place in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Person has a different meaning from "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." For <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as has been said (1), designates the specific <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> which is signified by the definition. And if nothing was found to be added to what belongs to the notion of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, there would be no need to distinguish the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> from the suppositum of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> (which is the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> subsisting in this <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>), because every <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> subsisting in a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> would be altogether one with its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now in certain subsisting things we happen to find what does not belong to the notion of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, viz. <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> and individuating principles, which appears chiefly in such as are composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Hence in such as these the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and the suppositum really differ; not indeed as if they were wholly separate, but because the suppositum includes the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and in addition certain other things outside the notion of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Hence the suppositum is taken to be a whole which has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as its formal part to perfect it; and consequently in such as are composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not predicated of the suppositum, for we do not say that this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is his manhood. But if there is a thing in which there is nothing outside the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> or its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> (as in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>), the suppositum and the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> are not really distinct in it, but only in our way of thinking, inasmuch it is called "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>" as it is an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, and a "suppositum" as it is subsisting. And what is said of a suppositum is to be applied to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in rational or <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> creatures; for a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is nothing else than "an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>," according to <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a>. Therefore, whatever adheres to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is united to it in <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, whether it belongs to its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or not. Hence, if the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Word in <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, it is nowise united to Him; and thus <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> is altogether done away with, and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> wholly overturned. Therefore, inasmuch as the Word has a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> united to Him, which does not belong to His Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, it follows that the union took place in the Person of the Word, and not in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> and Person are not really distinct, yet they have distinct meanings, as was said above, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> signifies after the manner of something subsisting. And because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is united to the Word, so that the Word subsists in it, and not so that His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> receives therefrom any addition or change, it follows that the union of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> took place in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and not in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Personality pertains of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> to the dignity of a thing, and to its perfection so far as it pertains to the dignity and perfection of that thing to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> by itself (which is understood by the word "person"). Now it is a greater dignity to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in something nobler than oneself than to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> by oneself. Hence the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has a greater dignity than ours, from this very fact that in us, being existent by itself, it has its own personality, but in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in the Person of the Word. Thus to perfect the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> belongs to the dignity of a form, yet the sensitive part in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, on account of its union with the nobler form which perfects the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, is more noble than in brutes, where it is itself the form which perfects.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> "did not assume <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in general, but 'in atomo'"--that is, in an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>--as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 11) otherwise every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would be the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, even as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was. Yet we must bear in mind that not every <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> in the genus of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, even in rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, is a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, but that alone which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> by itself, and not that which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in some more perfect thing. Hence the hand of <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a>, although it is a kind of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, is not a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, because it does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> by itself, but in something more perfect, viz. in the whole. And hence, too, this is signified by a "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>" being defined as "an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>," for the hand is not a complete <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, but part of a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Therefore, although this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is a kind of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> in the genus of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, it has not its own personality, because it does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> separately, but in something more perfect, viz. in the Person of the Word. Therefore the union took place in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the union of the Word Incarnate took place in the suppositum or hypostasis?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the union of the Word Incarnate did not take place in the suppositum or hypostasis. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion xxxv, xxxviii): "Both the Divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> are one <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, but they are one thing [aliud] by reason of the Word and another thing [aliud] by reason of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." And Pope Leo says in his letter to Flavian (Ep. xxviii): "One of these is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> with <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, the other succumbs under injuries." But "one" [aliud] and "the other" [aliud] differ in suppositum. Therefore the union of the Word Incarnate did not take place in the suppositum.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, hypostasis is nothing more than a "particular <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>," as <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Duab. Nat.). But it is plain that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there is another particular <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> beyond the hypostasis of the Word, viz. the body and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the resultant of these. Therefore there is another hypostasis in Him besides the hypostasis of the Word.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the hypostasis of the Word is not included in any genus or <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as is plain from [I, 3, 5]. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, inasmuch as He is made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, is contained under the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; for <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. 1): "Within the limits of our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> He came, Who far surpasses the whole order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> supersubstantially." Now nothing is contained under the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> unless it be a hypostasis of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Therefore in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there is another hypostasis besides the hypostasis of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>; and hence the same conclusion follows as above.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 3,4,5): "In <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> we acknowledge two natures and one hypostasis."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some who did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the relation of hypostasis to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, although granting that there is but one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, held, nevertheless, that there is one hypostasis of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and another of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and hence that the union took place in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and not in the hypostasis. Now this, for three reasons, is clearly <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>. First, because <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> only adds to hypostasis a determinate <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, viz. rational, according to what <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Duab. Nat.), "a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>"; and hence it is the same to attribute to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> a proper hypostasis and a proper <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers, seeing this, condemned both in the <a href="../cathen/04308b.htm">Fifth Council</a> held at Constantinople, saying: "If anyone seeks to introduce into the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> two subsistences or two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>. For by the incarnation of one of the Holy <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Word, the Holy <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> received no augment of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> or subsistence." Now "subsistence" is the same as the subsisting thing, which is proper to hypostasis, as is plain from <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> (De Duab. Nat.). Secondly, because if it is granted that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> adds to hypostasis something in which the union can take place, this something is nothing else than a property pertaining to dignity; according as it is said by some that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is a "hypostasis distinguished by a property pertaining to dignity." If, therefore, the union took place in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and not in the hypostasis, it follows that the union only took place in regard to some dignity. And this is what Cyril, with the approval of the Council of Ephesus (part iii, can. 3), condemned in these terms: "If anyone after the uniting divides the subsistences in the one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, only joining them in a union of dignity or authority or power, and not rather in a concourse of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> union, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>." Thirdly, because to the hypostasis alone are attributed the operations and the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> properties, and whatever belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in the concrete; for we say that this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> reasons, and is risible, and is a rational animal. So likewise this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is said to be a suppositum, because he underlies [supponitur] whatever belongs to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and receives its predication. Therefore, if there is any hypostasis in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> besides the hypostasis of the Word, it follows that whatever pertains to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is verified of some other than the Word, e.g. that He was born of a Virgin, suffered, was crucified, was buried. And this, too, was condemned with the approval of the Council of Ephesus (part iii, can. 4) in these words: "If anyone ascribes to two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> or subsistences such words as are in the evangelical and apostolic <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, or have been said of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, or by Himself of Himself, and, moreover, applies some of them to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, taken as distinct from the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, and some of them (as if they could be used of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone) only to the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> the Father, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>." Therefore it is plainly a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> condemned long since by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to say that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there are two hypostases, or two supposita, or that the union did not take place in the hypostasis or suppositum. Hence in the same Synod (can. 2) it is said: "If anyone does not confess that the Word was united to flesh in subsistence, and that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> with His flesh is both--to wit, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>--let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> difference makes a thing "other" [alterum, so <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> difference makes "another thing" [aliud]. Now it is plain that the "otherness" which springs from <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> difference may pertain to the same hypostasis or suppositum in <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things, since the same thing numerically can underlie different <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>. But it does not happen in <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things that the same numerically can subsist in divers <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essences</a> or <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>. Hence just as when we speak of "otherness" in regard to creatures we do not signify diversity of suppositum, but only diversity of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> forms, so likewise when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is said to be one thing or another thing, we do not imply diversity of suppositum or hypostasis, but diversity of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory Nazianzen</a> says in a letter to Chelidonius (Ep. ci): "In the Saviour we may find one thing and another, yet He is not one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and another. And I say 'one thing and another'; whereas, on the contrary, in the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> we say one Person and another (so as not to confuse the subsistences), but not one thing and another."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Hypostasis signifies a particular <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, not in every way, but as it is in its complement. Yet as it is in union with something more complete, it is not said to be a hypostasis, as a hand or a foot. So likewise the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, although it is a particular <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, nevertheless cannot be called a hypostasis or suppositum, seeing that it is in union with a completed thing, viz. the whole <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But the complete being with which it concurs is said to be a hypostasis or suppositum.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things a singular thing is placed in a genus or <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, not on account of what belongs to its individuation, but on account of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which springs from its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, and in composite things individuation is taken more from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Hence we say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> by reason of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> assumed, and not by reason of the hypostasis.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether after Incarnation the Person or Hypostasis of Christ is composite?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the Person of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not composite. For the Person of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is naught else than the Person or hypostasis of the Word, as appears from what has been said (2). But in the Word, Person and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> do not differ, as appears from I, 39, 1]. Therefore since the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> of the Word is simple, as was shown above (I, 3, 7), it is impossible that the Person of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> be composite.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, all composition requires parts. But the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> is incompatible with the notion of a part, for every part implicates the notion of imperfection. Therefore it is impossible that the Person of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> be composed of two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, what is composed of others would seem to be homogeneous with them, as from bodies only a body can be composed. Therefore if there is anything in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> composed of the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, it follows that this will not be a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> but a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and hence the union in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> will take place in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which is contrary to 2].

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 3,4,5), "In the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> we acknowledge two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, but one hypostasis composed from both."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The Person or hypostasis of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> may be viewed in two ways. First as it is in itself, and thus it is altogether simple, even as the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> of the Word. Secondly, in the aspect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> or hypostasis to which it belongs to subsist in a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and thus the Person of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> subsists in two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>. Hence though there is one subsisting being in Him, yet there are different aspects of subsistence, and hence He is said to be a composite <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, insomuch as one being subsists in two.

<p>And thereby the solution to the first is clear.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This composition of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> from natures is not so called on account of parts, but by reason of number, even as that in which two things concur may be said to be composed of them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is not verified in every composition, that the thing composed is homogeneous with its component parts, but only in the parts of a continuous thing; for the continuous is composed solely of continuous [parts]. But an animal is composed of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, and neither of these is an animal.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether in Christ there is any union of soul and body?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was no union of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body. For from the union of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body in us a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> or a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> hypostasis is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a>. Hence if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body were united in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, it follows that a hypostasis resulted from their union. But this was not the hypostasis of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Word, for It is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. Therefore in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there would be a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> or hypostasis besides the hypostasis of the Word, which is contrary to 2,3.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, from the union of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body results the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 3), that "we must not conceive a common <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>." Therefore there was no union of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body in Him.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united to the body for the sole purpose of quickening it. But the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> could be quickened by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> Himself, seeing He is the fount and principle of life. Therefore in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was no union of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The body is not said to be animated save from its union with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Now the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is said to be animated, as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> chants: "Taking an animate body, He deigned to be born of a Virgin" [Feast of the Circumcision, Ant. ii, Lauds]. Therefore in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was a union of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is called a man univocally with other men, as being of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse7">Philippians 2:7</a>), "being made in the likeness of a man." Now it belongs <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be united to the body, for the form does not constitute the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, except inasmuch as it becomes the act of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and this is the terminus of generation through which <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> intends the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Hence it must be said that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was united to the body; and the contrary is <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>, since it destroys the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> humanity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This would seem to be the reason which was of weight with such as denied the union of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, viz. lest they should thereby be forced to admit a second <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> or hypostasis in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, since they saw that the union of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body in mere men resulted in a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. But this happens in mere men because the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body are so united in them as to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> by themselves. But in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> they are united together, so as to be united to something higher, which subsists in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> composed of them. And hence from the union of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> a new hypostasis or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> does not result, but what is composed of them is united to the already <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> hypostasis or Person. Nor does it therefore follow that the union of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is of less effect than in us, for its union with something nobler does not lessen but increases its <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and worth; just as the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in animals constitutes the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as being considered the ultimate form, yet it does not do so in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, although it is of greater effect and dignity, and this because of its union with a further and nobler perfection, viz. the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as has been said above (2, ad 2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This saying of <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> may be taken in two ways: First, as referring to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which, as it is in one <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> alone, has not the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a common <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but only inasmuch as either it is abstracted from every <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, and considered in itself by the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, or according as it is in all <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> did not assume <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in the pure thought of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, since in this way He would not have assumed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in reality, unless it be said that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is a separate <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, just as the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a> conceived of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> without <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But in this way the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> would not have assumed flesh, contrary to what is written (<a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse39">Luke 24:39</a>), "A spirit hath not flesh and bones as you see Me to have." Neither can it be said that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> assumed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as it is in all the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, otherwise He would have assumed all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Therefore it remains, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says further on (De Fide Orth. iii, 11) that He assumed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> "in atomo," i.e. in an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>; not, indeed, in another <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> which is a suppositum or a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but in the Person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.

<p>Secondly, this saying of <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> may be taken not as referring to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as if from the union of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body one common <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> (viz. <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>) did not result, but as referring to the union of the two natures Divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>: which do not combine so as to form a third something that becomes a common <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, for in this way it would become predicable of many, and this is what he is aiming at, since he adds: "For there was not generated, neither will there ever be generated, another <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who from the Godhead and manhood, and in the Godhead and manhood, is perfect <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and perfect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There are two principles of corporeal life: one the effective principle, and in this way the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is the principle of all life; the other, the formal principle of life, for since "in living things to be is to live," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima ii, 37), just as everything is formally by its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, so likewise the body lives by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: in this way a body could not live by the Word, Which cannot be the form of a body.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the human nature was united to the Word of God accidentally?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was united to the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse7">Philippians 2:7</a>) of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, that He was "in <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> found as a man." But <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> associated with that to which it pertains, whether <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> be taken for one of the ten predicaments or as a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> united to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever comes to a thing that is complete in being comes to it <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, for an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> is said to be what can come or go without the subject being corrupted. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> came to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, Who had perfect being from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. Therefore it came to Him <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whatever does not pertain to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of a thing is its <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, for whatever is, is either a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> or an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> does not pertain to the Divine Essence or <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, for the union did not take place in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as was said above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Hence the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> must have accrued <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, an instrument accrues <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was the instrument of the Godhead in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, for <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 15), that "the flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the instrument of the Godhead." Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was united to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Whatever is predicated <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, predicates, not <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, but <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, or some other mode of being. If therefore the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> accrues <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, when we say <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, we do not predicate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, but <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> or <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, or some other mode of being, which is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a> of <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Pope Alexander III</a>, who says (Conc. Later. iii): "Since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is perfect <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and perfect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, what foolhardiness have some to dare to affirm that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>?"

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In evidence of this question we must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that two <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> have arisen with regard to the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the union of the two natures in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The first confused the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, as Eutyches and Dioscorus, who held that from the two natures one <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> resulted, so that they confessed Christ to be "from" two natures (which were distinct before the union), but not "in" two natures (the distinction of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> coming to an end after the union). The second was the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> and Theodore of Mopsuestia, who separated the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. For they held the Person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> to be distinct from the Person of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, and said these were mutually united: first, "by indwelling," inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> dwelt in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as in a temple; secondly, "by unity of <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>," inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was always in agreement with the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>; thirdly, "by operation," inasmuch as they said the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was the instrument of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>; fourthly, "by greatness of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>," inasmuch as all <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> shown to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was equally shown to the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, on account of His union with the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; fifthly, "by equivocation," i.e. communication of names, inasmuch as we say that this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Now it is plain that these modes imply an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> union.

<p>But some more recent masters, thinking to avoid these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> fell into them. For some conceded one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but maintained two hypostases, or two supposita, saying that a man, composed of body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, was from the beginning of his conception assumed by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>. And this is the first opinion set down by the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> (Sent. iii, D, 6). But others desirous of keeping the unity of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, held that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not united to the body, but that these two were mutually separate, and were united to the Word <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, so that the number of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> might not be increased. And this is the third opinion which the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> sets down (Sent. iii, D, 6).

<p>But both of these opinions fall into the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>; the first, indeed, because to maintain two hypostases or supposita in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the same as to maintain two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, as was shown above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). And if stress is laid on the word "person," we must have in mind that even <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> spoke of unity of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> on account of the unity of dignity and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. Hence the fifth Council (Constantinople II, coll. viii, can. 5) directs an <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> against such a one as holds "one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in dignity, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and adoration, as Theodore and <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> foolishly wrote." But the other opinion falls into the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> by maintaining an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> union. For there is no difference in saying that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is united to the Man Christ by indwelling, as in His temple (as <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> said), or by putting on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as a garment, which is the third opinion; rather it says something worse than <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>--to wit, that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body are not united.

<p>Now the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, holding the mean between the aforesaid positions, does not affirm that the union of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> took place in the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> or <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, nor yet in something <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>, but midway, in a subsistence or hypostasis. Hence in the fifth Council (Constantinople II, coll. viii, can. 5) we read: "Since the unity may be understood in many ways, those who follow the impiety of Apollinaris and Eutyches, professing the destruction of what came together" (i.e. destroying both <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>), "confess a union by mingling; but the followers of Theodore and <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, maintaining division, introduce a union of purpose. But the Holy Church of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, rejecting the impiety of both these treasons, confesses a union of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> with flesh, by composition, which is in subsistence." Therefore it is plain that the second of the three opinions, mentioned by the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> (Sent. iii, D, 6), which holds one hypostasis of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, is not to be called an opinion, but an article of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. So likewise the first opinion which holds two hypostases, and the third which holds an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> union, are not to be styled opinions, but <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> condemned by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in Councils.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 26): "Examples need not be wholly and at all points similar, for what is wholly similar is the same, and not an example, and especially in Divine things, for it is impossible to find a wholly similar example in the Theology," i.e. in the Godhead of Persons, "and in the Dispensation," i.e. the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is likened to a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, i.e. a garment, not indeed in regard to <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> union, but inasmuch as the Word is seen by the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as a man by his garment, and also inasmuch as the garment is changed, for it is shaped according to the figure of him who puts it on, and yet he is not changed from his form on account of the garment. So likewise the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> assumed by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is ennobled, but the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is not changed, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Qq. 83, qu. 73).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Whatever accrues after the completion of the being comes <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, unless it be taken into communion with the complete being, just as in the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> the body comes to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>, yet not <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, because it is assumed unto the same being, so that the body has vital being through the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; but it is not so with whiteness, for the being of whiteness is other than the being of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to which whiteness comes. But the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> had complete being in hypostasis or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; while in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> accrued to it, not as if it were assumed unto one being inasmuch as this is of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> (even as the body is assumed to the being of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>), but to one being inasmuch as this is of the hypostasis or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> united to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Accident is divided against <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, as is plain from Metaph. v, 25, is taken in two ways: first, for <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> or <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; secondly, for suppositum or hypostasis--hence the union having taken place in the hypostasis, is enough to show that it is not an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> union, although the union did not take place in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Not everything that is assumed as an instrument pertains to the hypostasis of the one who assumes, as is plain in the case of a saw or a sword; yet nothing prevents what is assumed into the unity of the hypostasis from being as an instrument, even as the body of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> or his members. Hence <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> held that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was assumed by the Word merely as an instrument, and not into the unity of the hypostasis. And therefore he did not concede that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was really the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, but His instrument. Hence Cyril says (Epist. ad Monach. Aegyptii): "The <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> does not affirm that this Emmanuel," i.e. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, "was assumed for the office of an instrument, but as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> humanized," i.e. made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> held that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is an instrument belonging to the unity of the hypostasis.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the union of the Divine nature and the human is anything created?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the union of the Divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> natures is not anything <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>. For there can be nothing <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because whatever is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But the union is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself is united to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore it seems that the union is not anything <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the end holds first place in everything. But the end of the union is the Divine hypostasis or Person in which the union is terminated. Therefore it seems that this union ought chiefly to be judged with reference to the dignity of the Divine hypostasis, which is not anything <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>. Therefore the union is nothing <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "That which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a thing being such is still more so" (Poster. i). But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is said to be the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a> on account of the union. Therefore much more is the union itself nothing <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Whatever has a beginning in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> is <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>. Now this union was not from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, but began in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Therefore the union is something <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The union of which we are speaking is a relation which we consider between the Divine and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, inasmuch as they come together in one Person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Now, as was said above (I, 13, 7), every relation which we consider between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the creature is really in the creature, by whose change the relation is brought into being; whereas it is not really in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but only in our way of thinking, since it does not arise from any change in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And hence we must say that the union of which we are speaking is not really in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, except only in our way of thinking; but in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which is a creature, it is really. Therefore we must say it is something <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This union is not really in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but only in our way of thinking, for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said to be united to a creature inasmuch as the creature is really united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> without any change in Him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a relation, as of motion, depends on the subject. And since this union has its being nowhere save in a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as was said above, it follows that it has a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> being.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is called Creator and is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> because of the union, inasmuch as it is terminated in the Divine hypostasis; yet it does not follow that the union itself is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a> or <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because that a thing is said to be <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> regards its being rather than its relation.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether union is the same as assumption?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that union is the same as assumption. For relations, as motions, are specified by their termini. Now the term of assumption and union is one and the same, viz. the Divine hypostasis. Therefore it seems that union and assumption are not different.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> the same thing seems to be what unites and what assumes, and what is united and what is assumed. But union and assumption seem to follow the action and passion of the thing uniting and the united, of the thing assuming and the assumed. Therefore union seems to be the same as assumption.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 11): "Union is one thing, incarnation is another; for union demands mere copulation, and leaves unsaid the end of the copulation; but incarnation and humanation determine the end of copulation." But likewise assumption does not determine the end of copulation. Therefore it seems that union is the same as assumption.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> is said to be united, not assumed.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was stated above (<a href="#7">Article 7</a>), union implies a certain relation of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, according as they come together in one Person. Now all relations which begin in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> are brought about by some change; and change consists in action and passion. Hence the "first" and principal difference between assumption and union must be said to be that union implies the relation: whereas assumption implies the action, whereby someone is said to assume, or the passion, whereby something is said to be assumed. Now from this difference another "second" difference arises, for assumption implies "becoming," whereas union implies "having become," and therefore the thing uniting is said to be united, but the thing assuming is not said to be assumed. For the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is taken to be in the terminus of assumption unto the Divine hypostasis when <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is spoken of; and hence we can <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> say that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, Who assumes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> unto Himself, is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, considered in itself, i.e. in the <a href="../cathen/01074a.htm">abstract</a>, is viewed as assumed; and we do not say the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. From this same follows a "third" difference, which is that a relation, especially one of equiparance, is no more to one extreme than to the other, whereas action and passion bear themselves differently to the agent and the patient, and to different termini. And hence assumption determines the term whence and the term whither; for assumption means a taking to oneself from another. But union determines none of these things. hence it may be said indifferently that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is united with the Divine, or conversely. But the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> is not said to be assumed by the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, but conversely, because the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is joined to the Divine personality, so that the Divine Person subsists in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Union and assumption have not the same relation to the term, but a different relation, as was said above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> What unites and what assumes are not the same. For whatsoever Person assumes unites, and not conversely. For the Person of the Father united the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to the Son, but not to Himself; and hence He is said to unite and not to assume. So likewise the united and the assumed are not identical, for the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> is said to be united, but not assumed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02006b.htm">Assumption</a> determines with whom the union is made on the part of the one assuming, inasmuch as assumption means taking unto oneself [ad se sumere, whereas incarnation and humanation (determine with whom the union is made) on the part of the thing assumed, which is flesh or <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. And thus assumption differs <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> both from union and from incarnation or humanation.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether the union of the two natures in Christ is the greatest of all unions?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the union of the two natures in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not the greatest of all unions. For what is united falls short of the unity of what is one, since what is united is by participation, but one is by <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Now in <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things there are some that are simply one, as is shown especially in unity itself, which is the principle of number. Therefore the union of which we are speaking does not imply the greatest of all unions.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the greater the distance between things united, the less the union. Now, the things united by this union are most distant--namely, the Divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>; for they are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> apart. Therefore their union is the least of all.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, from union there results one. But from the union of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body in us there arises what is one in <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; whereas from the union of the Divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> there results what is one in <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> only. Therefore the union of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body is greater than that of the Divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>; and hence the union of which we speak does not imply the greatest unity.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. i, 10) that "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, more than the Son in the Father." But the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is in the Father by unity of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is in the Son by the union of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>. Therefore the union of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> is greater than the unity of the Divine Essence, which nevertheless is the greatest union; and thus the union of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> implies the greatest unity.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Union implies the joining of several in some one thing. Therefore the union of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> may be taken in two ways: first, in regard to the things united; secondly, in regard to that in which they are united. And in this regard this union has a pre-eminence over other unions; for the unity of the Divine Person, in which the two natures are united, is the greatest. But it has no pre-eminence in regard to the things united.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The unity of the Divine Person is greater than numerical unity, which is the principle of number. For the unity of a Divine Person is an uncreated and self-subsisting unity, not received into another by participation. Also, it is complete in itself, having in itself whatever pertains to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of unity; and therefore it is not compatible with the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a part, as in numerical unity, which is a part of number, and which is shared in by the things numbered. And hence in this respect the union of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> is higher than numerical unity by reason of the unity of the Divine Person, and not by reason of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which is not the unity of the Divine Person, but is united to it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This reason regards the things united, and not the Person in Whom the union takes place.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The unity of the Divine Person is greater than the unity of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in us; and hence the union of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> is greater than the union of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body in us.

<p>And because what is urged in the argument "on the contrary" rests upon what is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>--namely, that the union of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> is greater than the unity of the Divine Persons in Essence--we must say to the authority of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not more in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> than the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> in the Father, but much less. But the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in some respects is more in the Son than the Son in the Father--namely, inasmuch as the same suppositum is signified when I say "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," meaning <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and when I say "<a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>"; whereas it is not the same suppositum of Father and Son.

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether the union of Incarnation took place by grace?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the union of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> did not take place by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, as was shown above (I-II, 110, 2). But the union of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to the Divine did not take place <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, as was shown above (<a href="#6">Article 6</a>). Therefore it seems that the union of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> did not take place by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the subject of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But it is written (<a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse9">Colossians 2:9</a>): "In <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Him'] dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead corporeally." Therefore it seems that this union did not take place by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> is united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. If, therefore, the union of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> was by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, it would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is said to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> no more than other <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Praed. Sanct. xv): "By the same <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is made a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, from the beginning of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from His beginning was made <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." But this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> became <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by union with the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>. Therefore this union was by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was said above (I-II, 110, 1), <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is taken in two ways:--first, as the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gratuitously bestowing something; secondly, as the free <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> stands in need of the gratuitous will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in order to be lifted up to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since this is above its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> capability. Moreover, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is lifted up to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in two ways: first, by operation, as the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; secondly, by personal being, and this mode belongs exclusively to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in Whom <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is assumed so as to be in the Person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. But it is plain that for the perfection of operation the power needs to be perfected by a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, whereas that a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> has being in its own suppositum does not take place by means of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p>And hence we must say that if <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> be understood as the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gratuitously doing something or reputing anything as well-pleasing or acceptable to Him, the union of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> took place by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, even as the union of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and love. But if <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> be taken as the free <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then the fact that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is united to the Divine Person may be called a <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, inasmuch as it took place without being preceded by any <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>--but not as though there were an <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, by means of which the union took place.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> is a certain likeness of the Divinity participated by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But by <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not said to have participated a likeness of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but is said to be united to the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> itself in the Person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. Now the thing itself is greater than a participated likeness of it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Habitual <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is only in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; but the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, i.e. the free <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of being united to the Divine Person belongs to the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which is composed of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body. And hence it is said that the fulness of the Godhead dwelt corporeally in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> because the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> is united not merely to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but to the body also. Although it may also be said that it dwelt in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> corporeally, i.e. not as in a shadow, as it dwelt in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the old <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, of which it is said in the same place (<a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse17">Colossians 2:17</a>) that they are the "shadow of things to come but the body is Christ" [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Christ's', inasmuch as the body is opposed to the shadow. And some say that the Godhead is said to have dwelt in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> corporeally, i.e. in three ways, just as a body has three dimensions: first, by <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, presence, and power, as in other creatures; secondly, by <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, as in the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; thirdly, by personal union, which is proper to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p>Hence the reply to the third is manifest, viz. because the union of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> did not take place by <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> alone, but in subsistence or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<h2 id="article11">Article 11. Whether any merits preceded the union of Incarnation?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the union of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> followed upon certain <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, because upon <a href="../bible/psa032.htm#verse22">Psalm 32:22</a>, "Let Thy mercy, o Lord, be upon us, as," etc. a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "Here the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>'s desire for the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> and its <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> fulfilment are hinted at." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> falls under <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whoever <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> anything <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> that without which it cannot be. But the ancient Fathers <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, to which they were able to attain only by <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>; for <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xiii): "Those who came into this world before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> coming, whatsoever eminency of righteousness they may have had, could not, on being divested of the body, at once be admitted into the bosom of the heavenly country, seeing that He had not as yet come Who, by His own descending, should place the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the righteous in their everlasting seat." Therefore it would seem that they <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> it is sung that "she <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> to bear the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord of all</a>" [<a href="../cathen/09294a.htm">Little Office of B.V.M.</a>, Dominican Rite, Ant. at Benedictus], and this took place through <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> falls under <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Praed. Sanct. xv): "Whoever can find <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> preceding the singular generation of our Head, may also find <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> preceding the repeated regeneration of us His members." But no <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> preceded our regeneration, according to <a href="../bible/tit003.htm#verse5">Titus 3:5</a>: "Not by the works of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, by the laver of regeneration." Therefore no <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> preceded the generation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> With regard to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself, it is clear from the above (<a href="#10">Article 10</a>) that no <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> of His could have preceded the union. For we do not hold that He was first of all a mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and that afterwards by the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> life it was granted Him to become the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, as <a href="../cathen/12043a.htm">Photinus</a> held; but we hold that from the beginning of His conception this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, seeing that He had no other hypostasis but that of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse35">Luke 1:35</a>: "The Holy which shall be born of thee shall be called the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>." And hence every operation of this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> followed the union. Therefore no operation of His could have been <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> of the union.

<p>Neither could the needs of any other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whatsoever have <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> this union condignly: first, because the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> works of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> are properly ordained to beatitude, which is the reward of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and consists in the full enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Whereas the union of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, inasmuch as it is in the personal being, transcends the union of the beatified mind with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is by the act of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in fruition; and therefore it cannot fall under <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. Secondly, because <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> cannot fall under <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, for the principle of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> does not fall under <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>; and therefore neither does <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, for it is the principle of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. Hence, still less does <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> fall under <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, since it is the principle of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse17">John 1:17</a>: "<a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> came by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>." Thirdly, because <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> is for the reformation of the entire <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and therefore it does not fall under the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of any <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of a mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the entire <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Yet the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> congruously by desiring and beseeching; for it was becoming that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should harken to those who obeyed Him.

<p>And thereby the reply to the First Objection is manifest.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> that under <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> falls everything without which there can be no reward. For there is something pre-required not merely for reward, but also for <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, as the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. And again, the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> is the principle of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, because "of His fulness we all have received" (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse16">John 1:16</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> is said to have <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> to bear the Lord of all; not that she <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> His <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, but because by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> bestowed upon her she <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> that grade of purity and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, which fitted her to be the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>.

<h2 id="article12">Article 12. Whether the grace of union was natural to the man Christ?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of union was not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For the union of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> did not take place in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but in the Person, as was said above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Now a thing is denominated from its terminus. Therefore this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> ought rather to be called personal than <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is divided against <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, even as gratuitous things, which are from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are distinguished from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things, which are from an intrinsic principle. But if things are divided in opposition to one another, one is not denominated by the other. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to Him.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> is that which is according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of union is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in regard to the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, otherwise it would belong to the other Persons; nor is it <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to Him according to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, otherwise it would belong to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, since they are of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as He. Therefore it would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of union is nowise <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion xl): "In the assumption of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> itself became somewhat <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, so as to leave no room for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in Him."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. v, 5), <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> designates, in one way, nativity; in another, the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of a thing. Hence <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> may be taken in two ways: first, for what is only from the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> principles of a thing, as it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to fire to mount; secondly, we call <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> what he has had from his birth, according to <a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse3">Ephesians 2:3</a>: "We were by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> children of wrath"; and <a href="../bible/wis012.htm#verse10">Wisdom 12:10</a>: "They were a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> generation, and their <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, whether of union or <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a>, cannot be called <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> as if <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the principles of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, although it may be called <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, as if coming to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> of His Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>. But these two kinds of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> are said to be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, inasmuch as He had them from His nativity, since from the beginning of His conception the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was united to the Divine Person, and His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was filled with the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although the union did not take place in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, yet it was <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the power of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and it, moreover, belonged to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> from the beginning of His nativity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The union is not said to be <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> in the same respect; for it is called <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> inasmuch as it is not from <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>; and it is said to be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inasmuch as by the power of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> it was in the humanity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> from His nativity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of union is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> according to His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as if it were <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the principles of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and hence it need not belong to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.
