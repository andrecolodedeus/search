<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether man should be contrite on account of the punishment, and not only on account of his sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a> on account of the punishment, and not only on account of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in De Poenitentia [Cf. Hom. 50 inter 1]: "No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> desires life everlasting unless he repent of this mortal life." But the <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morality</a> of this life is a punishment. Therefore the penitent should be <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a> on account of his punishments also.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> says (Sent. iv, D, 16, cap. i), quoting <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De vera et falsa Poenitentia [Work of an unknown author]), that the penitent should be sorry for having deprived himself of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But privation of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a punishment. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is sorrow for punishments also.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> No one holds to that for which he is sorry. But a penitent, by the very signification of the word, is one who holds to his punishment ["Poenitens," i.e. "poenam tenens"]. Therefore he is not sorry on account of his punishment, so that <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> which is penitential sorrow is not on account of punishment.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 1, Article 1), <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> implies the crushing of something hard and whole. Now this wholeness and hardness is found in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of fault, since the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> thereof in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>-doer, sticks to its own ground*, and refuses to yield to the precept of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, wherefore displeasure at a suchlike <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is called metaphorically "<a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>." [There is a play on the words here--'integer' (whole) and 'in suis terminis' (to its own ground)]. But this metaphor cannot be applied to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of punishment, because punishment simply denotes a lessening, so that it is possible to have sorrow for punishment but not <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, penance should be on account of this mortal life, not by reason of its mortality (unless penance be taken broadly for every kind of sorrow); but by reason of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, to which we are prone on account of the weakness of this life.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Sorrow for the loss of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> the same as <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, but is its principle. For just as we are moved to desire a thing on account of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> we expect to derive from it, so are we moved to be sorry for something on account of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> accruing to us therefrom.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether contrition should be on account of original sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> should be on account of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. For we ought to be <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a> on account of actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; not by reason of the act, considered as a kind of being, but by reason of its deformity, since the act, regarded in its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> has a deformity, even as actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has. Therefore we should be <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a> on its account also.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, by <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has been turned away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since in punishment thereof he was to be deprived of seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be displeased at having been turned away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be displeased at <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>; and so he ought to have <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> for it.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The medicine should be proportionate to the disease. Now we contracted <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> without willing to do so. Therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that we should be cleansed from it by an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, such as <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Contrition is sorrow, as stated above (1, 1,2), respecting and, so to speak, crushing the hardness of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Consequently it can regard those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> only which result in us through the hardness of our will. And as <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> was not brought upon us by our own will, but contracted from the origin of our infected <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it follows that, properly speaking, we cannot have <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> on its account, but only displeasure or sorrow.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Contrition is for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, not by reason of the mere <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the act, because it does not derive the character of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> therefrom; nor again, by reason of its deformity alone, because deformity, of itself, does not include the notion of guilt, and sometimes denotes a punishment. But <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> ought to be on account of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as implying deformity resulting from an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; and this does not apply to <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, so that <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> does not apply to it.

<p>The same Reply avails for the Second Objection, because <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is due to aversion of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether we should have contrition for every actual sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that we have no need to have <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> for every actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> we have committed. For contraries are healed by their contraries. Now some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are committed through sorrow, e.g. sloth and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>. Therefore their remedy should not be sorrow, such as <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is, but <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which cannot refer to that which is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. But there are <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of which we have no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, such as those we have forgotten. Therefore we cannot have <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> for them.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, by <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are blotted out which we committed <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>. But <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> takes away voluntariness, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> declares (Ethic. iii, 1). Therefore <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> need not cover things which have occurred through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, we need not be <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a> for a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is not removed by <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>. Now some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not removed by <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, e.g. venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, that remain after the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>. Therefore there is no need to have <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> for all one's past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Penance is a remedy for all actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But penance cannot regard some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, without <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> regarding them also, for it is the first part of Penance. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> should be for all one's past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p>Further, no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is forgiven a man unless he be justified. But justification requires <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, as stated above (1, 1; I-II, 113). Therefore it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to have <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> for all one's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Every actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by our will not yielding to <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">God's law</a>, either by transgressing it, or by omitting it, or by acting beside it: and since a hard thing is one that is disposed not to give way easily, hence it is that a certain hardness of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is to be found in every actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Wherefore, if a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is to be remedied, it needs to be taken away by <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> which crushes it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As clearly shown above (2, ad 1), <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is opposed to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in so far as it proceeds from the choice of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> that had failed to obey the command of <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">God's law</a>, and not as regards the material part of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and it is on this that the choice of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> falls. Now the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will's</a> choice falls not only on the acts of the other powers, which the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> uses for its own end, but also on the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will's</a> own proper act: for the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> wills to will something. Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will's</a> choice falls on that pain or sadness which is to be found in the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and the like, whether such pain be in the senses or in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> itself. Consequently the sorrow of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is opposed to those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> One may forget a thing in two ways, either so that it escapes the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> altogether, and then one cannot search for it; or so that it escapes from the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> in part, and in part remains, as when I remember having heard something in general, but <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what it was in particular, and then I search my <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> in order to discover it. Accordingly a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> also may be forgotten in two ways, either so as to remain in a general, but not in a particular remembrance, and then a man is bound to bethink himself in order to discover the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because he is bound to have <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> for each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And if he is unable to discover it, after applying himself with due care, it is enough that he be <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a> for it, according as it stands in his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and indeed he should grieve not only for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but also for having forgotten it, because this is owing to his neglect. If, however, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has escaped from his <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> altogether, then he is excused from his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> through being unable to fulfill it, and it is enough that he be <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a> in general for everything wherein he has offended <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But when this inability is removed, as when the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is recalled to his <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, then he is bound to have <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> for that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in particular, even as a poor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who cannot pay a debt, is excused, and yet is bound to, as soon as he can.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> were to remove altogether the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, it will excuse, and there would be no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and sometimes it does not remove the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> altogether, and then it does not altogether excuse, but only to a certain extent: wherefore a man is bound to be <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a> for a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> A venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can remain after <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> for a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but not after <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> for the venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: wherefore <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> should also cover venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> even as penance does, as stated above (Sent. iv, D, 16, 2, 2, qu. 2; Supplement, 87, 1).

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether a man is bound to have contrition for his future sins?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a man is bound to have <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> for his future <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> also. For <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is an act of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> extends to the future rather than to the past, since choice, which is an act of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, is about future contingents, as stated in Ethic. iii. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is about future <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> rather than about past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is aggravated by the result that ensues from it: wherefore <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says [<a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a> asserts this implicitly in De Vera Virgin.] that the punishment of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> is not yet ended, for it is yet possible for some to be ruined through his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, by reason of whose ruin his punishment would be increased: and the same applies to a man who is judged guilty of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, if he has committed a murderous assault, even before his victim dies. Now the sinner ought to be <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a> during that intervening time. Therefore the degree of his <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> ought to be proportionate not only to his past act, but also to its eventual result: and consequently <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> regards the future.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Contrition is a part of penance. But penance always regards the past: and therefore <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> does also, and consequently is not for a future <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In every series of things moving and moved ordained to one another, we find that the inferior mover has its proper movement, and besides this, it follows, in some respect, the movement of the superior mover: this is seen in the movement of the planets, which, in addition to their proper movements, follow the movement of the first <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Now, in all the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, the first mover is <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, which is called the charioteer of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Consequently each moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, in addition to its proper movement, has something of the movement of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>: and therefore, since penance is a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as it is a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, in addition to its own act, it acquires the movement of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Now its proper movement is towards its proper object, which is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed. Wherefore its proper and principal act, viz. <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> regards past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> alone; but, inasmuch as it acquires something of the act of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, it regards future <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> indirectly, although it is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> moved towards those future <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For this reason, he that is <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a>, is sorry for his past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and is cautious of future <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Yet we do not speak of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> for future <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but of caution, which is a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> conjoined to penance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is said to regard future contingents, in so far as it is concerned with acts, but not with the object of acts: because, of his own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, a man can think about past and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> things, and yet the very act of thinking, in so far as it is subject to the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, is a future <a href="../cathen/04331a.htm">contingent</a>. Hence the act the <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> also is a future <a href="../cathen/04331a.htm">contingent</a>, in so far as it is subject to the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>; and yet its object can be something past.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The consequent result which aggravates a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was already present in the act as in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; wherefore when the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was committed, its degree of gravity was already complete, and no further guilt accrued to it when the result took place. Nevertheless some <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> punishment accrues to it, in the respect of which the damned will have the more motives of regret for the more <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> that have resulted from their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. It is in this sense that <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> [<a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a>] speaks. Hence there is not need for <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> to be for other than past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether a man ought to have contrition for another's sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a man ought to have <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> for another's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For one should not ask forgiveness for a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> unless one is <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a> for it. Now forgiveness is asked for another's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in <a href="../bible/psa018.htm#verse13">Psalm 18:13</a>: "From those of others spare thy servant." Therefore a man ought to be <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a> for another's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is bound, ought of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, to love his neighbor as himself. Now, through love of himself, he both grieves for his ills, and desires <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things. Therefore, since we are bound to desire the goods of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> for our neighbor, as for ourselves, it seems that we ought to grieve for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, even as for our own. But <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is nothing else than sorrow for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of others.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Contrition is an act of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of penance. But no one repents save for what he has done himself. Therefore no one is <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a> for others' <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The same thing is crushed [conteritur] which hitherto was hard and whole. Hence <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> must needs be in the same subject in which the hardness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was hitherto: so that there is no <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> to be spared from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of others, in so far as, through fellowship with sinners, a man contracts a stain by consenting to their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: thus it is written (<a href="../bible/psa017.htm#verse27">Psalm 17:27</a>): "With the perverse thou wilt be perverted."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> We ought to grieve for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of others, but not to have <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> for them, because not all sorrow for past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, as is evident for what has been said already.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether it is necessary to have contrition for each mortal sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to have <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> for each mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For the movement of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> in justification is instantaneous: whereas a man cannot think of every mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in an instant. Therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to have <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> for each mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> should be for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, inasmuch as they turn us away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because we need not be <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a> for turning to creatures without turning away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now all mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> agree in turning us away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore one <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> for all is sufficient.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> have more in common with one another, than actual and <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. Now one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> blots out all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> both actual and original. Therefore one general <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> blots out all mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> For diverse diseases there are diverse remedies, since "what heals the eye will not heal the foot," as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (Super Marc. ix, 28). But <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is the special remedy for one mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore one general <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> for all mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> does not suffice.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is expressed by confession. But it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to confess each mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to have <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> for each mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Contrition may be considered in two ways, as to its origin, and as to its term. By origin of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> I mean the process of thought, when a man thinks of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and is sorry for it, albeit not with the sorrow of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, yet with that of attrition. The term of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is when that sorrow is already quickened by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Accordingly, as regards the origin of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, a man needs to be <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a> for each <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that he calls to mind; but as regards its term, it suffices for him to have one general <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> for all, because then the movement of his <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> acts in virtue of all his preceding dispositions.

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although all mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> agree in turning <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet they differ in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and mode of aversion, and in the degree of separation from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and this regards the different ways in which they turn us to creatures.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> acts in virtue of Christ's <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, Who had <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power for the blotting out of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and so for all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> suffices. But in <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, in addition to the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, an act of ours is requisite, which must, therefore, correspond to each <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, since it has not <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power for <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>.

<p>It may also be replied that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> generation; whereas Penance, as regards <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> and its other parts, is a kind of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> healing by way of some alteration. Now it is evident in the generation of a body, accompanied by corruption of another body, that all the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> contrary to the thing generated, and which were the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> of the thing corrupted, are removed by the one generation: whereas in alteration, only that <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> is removed which was contrary to the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> which is the term of the alteration. In like manner, one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> blots out all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> together and introduces a new life; whereas Penance does not blot out each <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, unless it be directed to each. For this reason it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to be <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a> for, and to confess each <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.
