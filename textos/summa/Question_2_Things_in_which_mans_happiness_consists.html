<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether man's happiness consists in wealth?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>. For since <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> last end, it must consist in that which has the greatest hold on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> affections. Now this is <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>: for it is written (<a href="../bible/ecc010.htm#verse19">Ecclesiastes 10:19</a>): "All things obey money." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> (De Consol. iii), <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is "a state of life made perfect by the aggregate of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things." Now money seems to be the means of possessing all things: for, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. v, 5), money was invented, that it might be a sort of guarantee for the acquisition of whatever <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> desires. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, since the desire for the sovereign <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> never fails, it seems to be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. But this is the case with <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> more than anything else; since "a covetous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall not be satisfied with <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>" (<a href="../bible/ecc005.htm#verse9">Ecclesiastes 5:9</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> consists in retaining <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> rather than in spreading it. But as <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Consol. ii), "<a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> shines in giving rather than in hoarding: for the miser is hateful, whereas the generous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is applauded." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> does not consist in <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is impossible for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> to consist in <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>. For <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> is twofold, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Polit. i, 3), viz. <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and artificial. Natural <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> is that which serves <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as a remedy for his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> wants: such as food, drink, clothing, cars, dwellings, and such like, while artificial <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> is that which is not a direct help to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as money, but is invented by the art of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, for the convenience of exchange, and as a measure of things salable.

<p>Now it is evident that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> cannot consist in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>. For <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> of this kind is sought for the sake of something else, viz. as a support of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: consequently it cannot be <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> last end, rather is it ordained to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as to its end. Wherefore in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, all such things are below <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and made for him, according to <a href="../bible/psa008.htm#verse8">Psalm 8:8</a>: "Thou hast subjected all things under his feet."

<p>And as to artificial <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, it is not sought save for the sake of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>; since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would not seek it except because, by its means, he procures for himself the necessaries of life. Consequently much less can it be considered in the light of the last end. Therefore it is impossible for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, which is the last end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, to consist in <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> All material things obey money, so far as the multitude of fools is concerned, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> no other than material goods, which can be obtained for money. But we should take our estimation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> goods not from the foolish but from the wise: just as it is for a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> whose sense of taste is in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> order, to judge whether a thing is palatable.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> All things salable can be had for money: not so <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, which cannot be sold. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/pro017.htm#verse16">Proverbs 17:16</a>): "What doth it avail a fool to have <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, seeing he cannot buy wisdom."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The desire for <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> is not <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>: because they suffice for <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in a certain measure. But the desire for artificial <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, for it is the servant of disordered <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, which is not curbed, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> makes clear (Polit. i, 3). Yet this desire for <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> otherwise than the desire for the sovereign <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. For the more perfectly the sovereign <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is possessed, the more it is loved, and other things despised: because the more we possess it, the more we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/sir024.htm#verse29">Sirach 24:29</a>): "They that eat me shall yet hunger." Whereas in the desire for <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> and for whatsoever temporal goods, the contrary is the case: for when we already possess them, we despise them, and seek others: which is the sense of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> words (<a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse13">John 4:13</a>): "Whosoever drinketh of this water," by which temporal goods are signified, "shall thirst again." The reason of this is that we realize more their insufficiency when we possess them: and this very fact shows that they are imperfect, and the sovereign <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> does not consist therein.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether man's happiness consists in honors?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in honors. For <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> or bliss is "the reward of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. i, 9). But <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> more than anything else seems to be that by which <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is rewarded, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 3). Therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists especially in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of great excellence seems especially to be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, which is the perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But that is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 3). Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse17">1 Timothy 1:17</a>): "To . . . the only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> desires above all is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. But nothing seems more desirable to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> than <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>: since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> suffers loss in all other things, lest he should suffer loss of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Happiness is in the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>. But <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is not in the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>, but rather in him who honors, and who offers deference to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. i, 5). Therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> does not consist in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is impossible for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> to consist in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. For <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is given to a man on account of some excellence in him; and consequently it is a sign and attestation of the excellence that is in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>. Now a man's excellence is in proportion, especially to his <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and to its parts, i.e. those goods by which he has a certain share of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. And therefore <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> can result from <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, but <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> cannot principally consist therein.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. i, 5), <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is not that reward of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, for which the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> work: but they receive <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> from men by way of reward, "as from those who have nothing greater to offer." But <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> reward is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> itself, for which the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> work: whereas if they worked for <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, it would no longer be a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but ambition.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Honor is due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of great excellence as a sign of attestation of excellence already <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a>: not that <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> makes them excellent.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> That <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> desires <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> above all else, arises from his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> desire for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, from which <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> results, as stated above. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> seeks to be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> especially by the wise, on whose judgment he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> himself to be excellent or <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether man's happiness consists in fame or glory?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. For <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> seems to consist in that which is paid to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> for the trials they have undergone in the world. But this is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse18">Romans 8:18</a>): "The sufferings of this time are not worthy to be compared with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to come, that shall be revealed in us." Therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is diffusive of itself, as stated by <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. iv). But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is spread abroad in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of others by <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> more than by anything else: since, according to <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> [<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, Contra Maxim. Arian. ii. 13, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> consists "in being well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and praised." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is the most enduring <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now this seems to be fame or <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; because by this men attain to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> after a fashion. Hence <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Consol. ii): "You seem to beget unto yourselves <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, when you think of your fame in future time." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in fame or <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Happiness is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But it happens that fame or <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>: for as <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Consol. iii), "many owe their renown to the lying reports spread among the people. Can anything be more shameful? For those who receive <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> fame, must needs blush at their own praise." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> does not consist in fame or <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> cannot consist in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> fame or <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> consists "in being well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and praised," as <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> [<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, Contra Maxim. Arian. ii, 13 says. Now the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> is related to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> otherwise than to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, whereas <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Wherefore the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is called <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, cannot be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: but rather <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of another's <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> proceeds from, and, in a fashion, is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> itself, inchoate or perfect. Consequently <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> cannot consist in fame or <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> depends on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. And therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> beatitude depends, as on its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, on the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; according to <a href="../bible/psa090.htm#verse15">Psalm 90:15-16</a>: "I will deliver him, and I will glorify him; I will fill him with length of days, and I will show him my <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>."

<p>Furthermore, we must observe that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> often fails, especially in contingent singulars, such as are <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>. For this reason <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is frequently deceptive. But since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be deceived, His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is always <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; hence it is written (<a href="../bible/2co010.htm#verse18">2 Corinthians 10:18</a>): "He . . . is approved . . . whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> commendeth."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> speaks, then, not of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which is with men, but of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, with His Angels. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/mar008.htm#verse38">Mark 8:38</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> shall confess him in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His Father, before His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>" [<a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> joins <a href="../bible/mar008.htm#verse38">Mark 8:38</a> with <a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse8">Luke 12:8</a> owing to a possible variant in his text, or to the fact that he was quoting from <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which, through fame or <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, is in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of many, if this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, must needs be derived from <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> himself: and hence it presupposes perfect or inchoate <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. But if the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, it does not harmonize with the thing: and thus <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in him who is looked upon as famous. Hence it follows that fame can nowise make <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Fame has no stability; in fact, it is easily ruined by <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> report. And if sometimes it endures, this is by <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>. But <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> endures of itself, and for ever.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether man's happiness consists in power?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in power. For all things desire to become like to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as to their last end and first beginning. But men who are in power, seem, on account of the similarity of power, to be most like to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: hence also in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> they are called "gods" (<a href="../bible/exo022.htm#verse28">Exodus 22:28</a>), "Thou shalt not speak ill of the gods." Therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in power.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is the perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But the highest perfection for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is to be able to rule others; which belongs to those who are in power. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in power.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, since <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is supremely desirable, it is contrary to that which is before all to be shunned. But, more than aught else, men shun servitude, which is contrary to power. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in power.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Happiness is the perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But power is most imperfect. For as <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Consol. iii), "the power of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot relieve the gnawings of care, nor can it avoid the thorny path of anxiety": and further on: "Think you a man is powerful who is surrounded by attendants, whom he inspires with fear indeed, but whom he <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> still more?"

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is impossible for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> to consist in power; and this for two reasons. First because power has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of principle, as is stated in Metaph. v, 12, whereas <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of last end. Secondly, because power has relation to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: whereas <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> proper and perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Wherefore some <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> might consist in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> use of power, which is by <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, rather than in power itself.

<p>Now four general reasons may be given to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in none of the foregoing external goods. First, because, since <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a>, it is incompatible with any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Now all the foregoing can be found both in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men. Secondly, because, since it is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> to "satisfy of itself," as stated in Ethic. i, 7, having gained <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot lack any needful <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But after acquiring any one of the foregoing, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may still lack many goods that are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to him; for instance, wisdom, bodily health, and such like. Thirdly, because, since <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is the perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> can accrue to anyone therefrom. This cannot be said of the foregoing: for it is written (<a href="../bible/ecc005.htm#verse12">Ecclesiastes 5:12</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>" are sometimes "kept to the hurt of the owner"; and the same may be said of the other three. Fourthly, because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is ordained to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> through principles that are in him; since he is ordained thereto <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>. Now the four goods mentioned above are due rather to external <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, and in most cases to fortune; for which reason they are called goods of fortune. Therefore it is evident that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> nowise consists in the foregoing.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> power is His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>: hence He cannot use His power otherwise than well. But it is not so with men. Consequently it is not enough for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, that he become like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in power, unless he become like Him in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> also.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as it is a very <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thing for a man to make <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> use of power in ruling many, so is it a very bad thing if he makes a bad use of it. And so it is that power is towards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Servitude is a hindrance to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> use of power: therefore is it that men <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> shun it; not because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a> consists in power.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether man's happiness consists in any bodily good?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in bodily goods. For it is written (<a href="../bible/sir030.htm#verse16">Sirach 30:16</a>): "There is no <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> above the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> of the health of the body." But <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in that which is best. Therefore it consists in the health of the body.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. v), that "to be" is better than "to live," and "to live" is better than all that follows. But for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> being and living, the health of the body is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Since, therefore, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a>, it seems that health of the body belongs more than anything else to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the more universal a thing is, the higher the principle from which it depends; because the higher a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is, the greater the scope of its power. Now just as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> of the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> consists in its flowing into something, so the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> of the end consists in its drawing the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Therefore, just as the First Cause is that which flows into all things, so the last end is that which attracts the desire of all. But being itself is that which is most desired by all. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists most of all in things pertaining to his being, such as the health of the body.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Man surpasses all other animals in regard to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. But in bodily goods he is surpassed by many animals; for instance, by the elephant in longevity, by the lion in strength, by the stag in fleetness. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> does not consist in goods of the body.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is impossible for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> to consist in the goods of the body; and this for two reasons. First, because, if a thing be ordained to another as to its end, its last end cannot consist in the preservation of its being. Hence a captain does not intend as a last end, the preservation of the ship entrusted to him, since a ship is ordained to something else as its end, viz. to navigation. Now just as the ship is entrusted to the captain that he may steer its course, so <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is given over to his will and reason; according to <a href="../bible/sir015.htm#verse14">Sirach 15:14</a>: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from the beginning and left him in the hand of his own counsel." Now it is evident that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is ordained to something as his end: since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a>. Therefore the last end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> reason and will cannot be the preservation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> being.

<p>Secondly, because, granted that the end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will and reason be the preservation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> being, it could not be said that the end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the body. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> being consists in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body; and though the being of the body depends on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, yet the being of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> depends not on the body, as shown above (I, 75, 2); and the very body is for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> for its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, and the instruments for the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that puts them into motion, that by their means he may do his work. Wherefore all goods of the body are ordained to the goods of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as to their end. Consequently <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> last end, cannot consist in goods of the body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Just as the body is ordained to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as its end, so are external goods ordained to the body itself. And therefore it is with reason that the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the body is preferred to external goods, which are signified by "<a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>," just as the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is preferred to all bodily goods.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Being taken simply, as including all perfection of being, surpasses life and all that follows it; for thus being itself includes all these. And in this sense <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> speaks. But if we consider being itself as participated in this or that thing, which does not possess the whole perfection of being, but has imperfect being, such as the being of any creature; then it is evident that being itself together with an additional perfection is more excellent. Hence in the same passage <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says that things that live are better than things that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> better than living things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Since the end corresponds to the beginning; this argument proves that the last end is the first beginning of being, in Whom every perfection of being is: Whose likeness, according to their proportion, some desire as to being only, some as to living being, some as to being which is living, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>. And this belongs to few.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether man's happiness consists in pleasure?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in pleasure. For since <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is the last end, it is not desired for something else, but other things for it. But this answers to pleasure more than to anything else: "for it is absurd to ask anyone what is his motive in wishing to be pleased" (Ethic. x, 2). Therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists principally in pleasure and delight.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> goes more deeply into the effect than the second <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>" (De Causis i). Now the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> of the end consists in its attracting the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Therefore, seemingly that which moves most the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, answers to the notion of the last end. Now this is pleasure: and a sign of this is that delight so far absorbs <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will and reason, that it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> him to despise other goods. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> last end, which is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, consists principally in pleasure.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, since desire is for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it seems that what all desire is best. But all desire delight; both wise and foolish, and even irrational creatures. Therefore delight is the best of all. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a>, consists in pleasure.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Consol. iii): "Any one that chooses to look back on his past excesses, will perceive that pleasures had a sad ending: and if they can render a man <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, there is no reason why we should not say that the very beasts are <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> too."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Because bodily delights are more generally <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, "the name of pleasure has been appropriated to them" (Ethic. vii, 13), although other delights excel them: and yet <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> does not consist in them. Because in every thing, that which pertains to its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is distinct from its proper <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>: thus in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> it is one thing that he is a mortal rational animal, and another that he is a risible animal. We must therefore consider that every delight is a proper <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> resulting from <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, or from some part of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>; since the reason that a man is delighted is that he has some fitting <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, either in reality, or in hope, or at least in <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>. Now a fitting <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, if indeed it be the perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, is precisely <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>: and if it is imperfect, it is a share of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, either proximate, or remote, or at least apparent. Therefore it is evident that neither is delight, which results from the perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, but something resulting therefrom as its proper <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>.

<p>But bodily pleasure cannot result from the perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> even in that way. For it results from a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> apprehended by sense, which is a power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which power makes use of the body. Now <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> pertaining to the body, and apprehended by sense, cannot be <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. For since the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> excels the capacity of corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, that part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is independent of a corporeal organ, has a certain <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> in regard to the body and those parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which are tied down to the body: just as immaterial things are in a way <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> as compared to material things, since a form is, after a fashion, contracted and bounded by <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, so that a form which is independent of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is, in a way, <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. Therefore sense, which is a power of the body, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the singular, which is determinate through <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: whereas the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which is a power independent of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the universal, which is abstracted from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and contains an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of singulars. Consequently it is evident that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is fitting to the body, and which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> bodily delight through being apprehended by sense, is not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but is quite a trifle as compared with the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/wis007.htm#verse9">Wisdom 7:9</a>) that "all gold in comparison of her, is as a little sand." And therefore bodily pleasure is neither <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> itself, nor a proper <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It comes to the same whether we desire <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, or desire delight, which is nothing else than the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite's</a> rest in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: thus it is owing to the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> force that a weighty body is borne downwards and that it rests there. Consequently just as <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is desired for itself, so delight is desired for itself and not for anything else, if the preposition "for" denote the final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But if it denote the formal or rather the motive <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, thus delight is desirable for something else, i.e. for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is the object of that delight, and consequently is its principle, and gives it its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>: for the reason that delight is desired is that it is rest in the thing desired.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The vehemence of desire for sensible delight arises from the fact that operations of the senses, through being the principles of our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, are more perceptible. And so it is that sensible pleasures are desired by the majority.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> All desire delight in the same way as they desire <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: and yet they desire delight by reason of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and not conversely, as stated above (ad 1). Consequently it does not follow that delight is the supreme and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but that every delight results from some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and that some delight results from that which is the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> and <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a>.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether some good of the soul constitutes man's happiness?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> constitutes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. For <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now this is threefold: external goods, goods of the body, and goods of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> does not consist in external goods, nor in goods of the body, as shown above (4,5). Therefore it consists in goods of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, we love that for which we desire <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, more than the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that we desire for it: thus we love a friend for whom we desire money, more than we love money. But whatever <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> a man desires, he desires it for himself. Therefore he loves himself more than all other goods. Now <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is what is loved above all: which is evident from the fact that for its sake all else is loved and desired. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> himself: not, however, in goods of the body; therefore, in goods of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, perfection is something belonging to that which is perfected. But <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is a perfection of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is something belonging to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But it is not something belonging to the body, as shown above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>). Therefore it is something belonging to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and thus it consists in goods of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 22), "that which constitutes the life of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is to be loved for its own sake." But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not to be loved for his own sake, but whatever is in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is to be loved for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in no <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 1, Article 8), the end is twofold: namely, the thing itself, which we desire to attain, and the use, namely, the attainment or possession of that thing. If, then, we speak of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> last end, it is impossible for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> last end to be the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself or something belonging to it. Because the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, considered in itself, is as something <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>: for it becomes <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> actually, from being <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>; and actually <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, from being <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>. Now since <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> is for the sake of act as for its fulfilment, that which in itself is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> cannot be the last end. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself cannot be its own last end.

<p>In like manner neither can anything belonging to it, whether power, <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, or act. For that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is the last end, is the perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> fulfilling the desire. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, otherwise the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, is for the universal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. And any <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> inherent to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a participated <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and consequently a portioned <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore none of them can be <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> last end.

<p>But if we speak of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> last end, as to the attainment or possession thereof, or as to any use whatever of the thing itself desired as an end, thus does something of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in respect of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, belong to his last end: since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> attains <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> through his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore the thing itself which is desired as end, is that which constitutes <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, and makes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>; but the attainment of this thing is called <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Consequently we must say that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is something belonging to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; but that which constitutes <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is something outside the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Inasmuch as this division includes all goods that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can desire, thus the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not only power, <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, or act, but also the object of these, which is something outside. And in this way nothing hinders us from saying that what constitutes <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As far as the proposed objection is concerned, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is loved above all, as the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> desired; whereas a friend is loved as that for which <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is desired; and thus, too, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> loves himself. Consequently it is not the same kind of love in both cases. As to whether <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> loves anything more than himself with the love of friendship there will be occasion to inquire when we treat of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Happiness, itself, since it is a perfection of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, is an inherent <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; but that which constitutes <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, viz. which makes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, is something outside his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as stated above.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether any created good constitutes man's happiness?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that some <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> constitutes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. For <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. vii) that Divine wisdom "unites the ends of first things to the beginnings of second things," from which we may gather that the summit of a lower <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> touches the base of the higher <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> highest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Since then the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is above <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as stated in I, 111, 1, it seems that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> somehow reaching the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the last end of each thing is that which, in relation to it, is perfect: hence the part is for the whole, as for its end. But the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> of creatures which is called the macrocosm, is compared to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who is called the microcosm (Phys. viii, 2), as perfect to imperfect. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> of creatures.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is made <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> by that which lulls his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> desire. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> desire does not reach out to a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> surpassing his capacity. Since then <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> capacity does not include that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which surpasses the limits of all creation, it seems that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can be made <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> by some <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Consequently some <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> constitutes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xix, 26): "As the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the life of the body, so <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> life of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>: of Whom it is written: 'Happy is that people whose <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the Lord' (<a href="../bible/psa143.htm#verse15">Psalm 143:15</a>)."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is impossible for any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to constitute <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. For <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is the perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which lulls the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> altogether; else it would not be the last end, if something yet remained to be desired. Now the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, i.e. of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, is the universal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; just as the object of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the universal <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Hence it is evident that naught can lull <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will, save the universal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. This is to be found, not in any creature, but in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone; because every creature has <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> by participation. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone can satisfy the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, according to the words of <a href="../bible/psa102.htm#verse5">Psalm 102:5</a>: "Who satisfieth thy desire with <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone constitutes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The summit of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does indeed touch the base of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, by a kind of likeness; but <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not rest there as in his last end, but reaches out to the universal fount itself of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is the common object of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of all the blessed, as being the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> and perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> If a whole be not the last end, but ordained to a further end, then the last end of a part thereof is not the whole itself, but something else. Now the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> of creatures, to which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is compared as part to whole, is not the last end, but is ordained to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as to its last end. Therefore the last end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> himself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Created <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is not less than that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is capable, as of something intrinsic and inherent to him: but it is less than the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of which he is capable, as of an object, and which is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. And the participated <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is in an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, and in the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, is a finite and restricted <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.
