<h1>Question 30. Concupiscence</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2030.htm#article1"> Is concupiscence in the sensitive appetite only?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2030.htm#article2"> Is concupiscence a specific passion?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2030.htm#article3"> Are some concupiscences natural, and some not natural?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2030.htm#article4"> Is concupiscence infinite?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether concupiscence is in the sensitive appetite only?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is not only in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. For there is a <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of wisdom, according to <a href="../bible/wis006.htm#verse21">Wisdom 6:21</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'desire'] of wisdom bringeth to the everlasting kingdom." But the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> can have no tendency to wisdom. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is not only in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the desire for the commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>: in fact the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse18">Romans 7:18</a>): "There dwelleth not in me, that is to say, in my flesh, that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." But desire for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> commandments is an act of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa118.htm#verse20">Psalm 118:20</a>: "My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> hath <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> [concupivit] to long for thy justifications." Therefore <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is not only in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to each power, its proper <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is a matter of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is in each power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and not only in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 12) that "the irrational part which is subject and amenable to reason, is divided into the faculties of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. This is the irrational part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, passive and <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. i, 11), "<a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is a craving for that which is pleasant." Now pleasure is twofold, as we shall state later on (31, 3,4): one is in the intelligible <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of reason; the other is in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> perceptible to the senses. The former pleasure seems to belong to <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> alone: whereas the latter belongs to both <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body: because the sense is a power seated in a bodily organ: wherefore sensible <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the whole composite. Now <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> seems to be the craving for this latter pleasure, since it belongs to the united <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, as is implied by the <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> word "concupiscentia." Therefore, properly speaking, <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty, which takes its name from it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The craving for wisdom, or other <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods, is sometimes called <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>; either by reason of a certain likeness; or on account of the craving in the higher part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> being so vehement that it overflows into the lower <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, so that the latter also, in its own way, tends to the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, following the lead of the higher <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, the result being that the body itself renders its service in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> matters, according to <a href="../bible/psa083.htm#verse3">Psalm 83:3</a>: "My heart and my flesh have rejoiced in the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Properly speaking, desire may be not only in the lower, but also in the higher <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. For it does not imply fellowship in craving, as <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> does; but simply movement towards the thing desired.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It belongs to each power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to seek its proper <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, which does not arise from apprehension. But the craving for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, by the animal <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, which arises from apprehension, belongs to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power alone. And to crave a thing under the aspect of something delightful to the senses, wherein <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> properly consists, belongs to the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> power.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether concupiscence is a specific passion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is not a specific <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> power. For <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are distinguished by their objects. But the object of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> power is something delightful to the senses; and this is also the object of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> declares (Rhet. i, 11). Therefore <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is not a specific <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. 83, qu. 33) that "<a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of transitory things": so that it is not distinct from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. But all specific <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are distinct from one another. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is not a specific <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to each <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty there is a specific contrary <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> in that faculty, as stated above (Question 23, Article 4). But no specific <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty is contrary to <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 12) that "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> when desired gives rise to <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>; when present, it gives <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>: in like manner, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> we apprehend makes us fear, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that is present makes us sad": from which we gather that as sadness is contrary to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, so is fear contrary to <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. But fear is not in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>, but in the irascible part. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is not a specific <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">Concupiscence</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and tends to pleasure, both of which are <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty. Hence it is distinguished from the other <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, as a specific <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (01; 23, 1), the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which gives pleasure to the senses is the common object of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty. Hence the various <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are distinguished according to the differences of that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now the diversity of this object can arise from the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the object, or from a diversity in its active power. The diversity, derived from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the active object, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a material difference of <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>: while the difference in regard to its active power <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a formal diversity of <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, in respect of which the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> differ specifically.

<p>Now the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the motive power of the end or of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, differs according as it is really present, or absent: because, according as it is present, it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the faculty to find rest in it; whereas, according as it is absent, it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the faculty to be moved towards it. Wherefore the object of sensible pleasure <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, inasmuch as, so to speak, it attunes and conforms the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> to itself; it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, inasmuch as, when absent, it draws the faculty to itself; and it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> pleasure, inasmuch as, when present, it makes the faculty to find rest in itself. Accordingly, <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> differing "in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>" from both <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and pleasure. But <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a> of this or that pleasurable object differ "in number."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Pleasurable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is the object of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, not absolutely, but considered as absent: just as the sensible, considered as past, is the object of <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>. For these particular <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> diversify the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, and even of the powers of the sensitive part, which regards particular things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In the passage quoted we have <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causal</a>, not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> predication: for <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, but an effect of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. We may also say that <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is taking <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> in a wide sense, for any movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> in respect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to come: so that it includes both <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and hope.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> which is directly contrary to <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> has no name, and stands in relation to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> in regard to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But since, like fear, it regards the absent <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; sometimes it goes by the name of fear, just as hope is sometimes called <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>. For a small <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is reckoned as though it were nothing: and consequently every movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> in future <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is called hope or fear, which regard <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as arduous.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether some concupiscences are natural, and some not natural?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a> are not divided into those which are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and those which are not. For <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> belongs to the animal <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, as stated above (01, ad 3). But the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is contrasted with the animal <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Therefore no <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, material differences makes no difference of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but only numerical difference; a difference which is outside the purview of science. But if some <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a> are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, and some not, they differ only in respect of their objects; which amounts to a material difference, which is one of number only. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a> should not be divided into those that are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and those that are not.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, reason is contrasted with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as stated in Phys. ii, 5. If therefore in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> there is a <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> which is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, it must needs be rational. But this is impossible: because, since <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, it belongs to the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, and not to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which is the rational <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Therefore there are no <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a> which are not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iii, 11 and Rhetor. i, 11) distinguishes <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a> from those that are not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is the craving for pleasurable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now a thing is pleasurable in two ways. First, because it is suitable to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the animal; for example, food, drink, and the like: and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of such pleasurable things is said to be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>. Secondly, a thing is pleasurable because it is apprehended as suitable to the animal: as when one apprehends something as <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and suitable, and consequently takes pleasure in it: and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of such pleasurable things is said to be not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, and is more wont to be called "cupidity."

<p>Accordingly <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a> of the first kind, or <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a>, are common to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and other animals: because to both is there something suitable and pleasurable according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: and in these all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> agree; wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iii, 11) calls them "common" and "<a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>." But <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a> of the second kind are proper to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, to whom it is proper to devise something as <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and suitable, beyond that which <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> requires. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. i, 11) that the former <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a> are "irrational," but the latter, "rational." And because different men reason differently, therefore the latter are also called (Ethic. iii, 11) "peculiar and acquired," i.e. in addition to those that are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The same thing that is the object of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, may be the object of the animal <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, once it is apprehended. And in this way there may be an animal <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of food, drink, and the like, which are objects of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The difference between those <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a> that are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and those that are not, is not merely a material difference; it is also, in a way, formal, in so far as it arises from a difference in the active object. Now the object of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is the apprehended <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Hence diversity of the active object follows from diversity of apprehension: according as a thing is apprehended as suitable, either by absolute apprehension, whence arise <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> calls "irrational" (Rhet. i, 11); or by apprehension together with deliberation, whence arise those <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a> that are not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, and which for this very reason the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> calls "rational" (Rhet. i, 11).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Man has not only universal reason, pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> faculty; but also particular reason pertaining to the sensitive faculty, as stated in the I, 78, 4; I, 81, 3: so that even rational <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> may pertain to the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Moreover the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> can be moved by the universal reason also, through the medium of the particular <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether concupiscence is infinite?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is not <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. For the object of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which has the aspect of an end. But where there is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> there is no end (Metaph. ii, 2). Therefore <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is of the fitting <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since it proceeds from love. But the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> is without proportion, and therefore unfitting. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, there is no passing through <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> things: and thus there is no reaching an ultimate term in them. But the subject of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is not delighted until he attain the ultimate term. Therefore, if <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> were <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, no delight would ever ensue.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Polit. i, 3) that "since <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, men desire an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of things."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is twofold; one is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, the other is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>. Natural <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> cannot be actually <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>: because it is of that which <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> requires; and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> ever tends to something finite and fixed. Hence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> never desires <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> meat, or <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> drink. But just as in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> there is <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a> successive <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>, so can this kind of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> successively; so that, for instance, after getting food, a man may desire food yet again; and so of anything else that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> requires: because these bodily goods, when obtained, do not last for ever, but fail. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of Samaria (<a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse13">John 4:13</a>): "Whosever drinketh of this water, shall thirst again."

<p>But non-<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is altogether <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. Because, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), it follows from the reason, and it belongs to the reason to proceed to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>. Hence he that desires <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, may desire to be rich, not up to a certain limit, but to be simply as rich as possible.

<p>Another reason may be assigned, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Polit. i, 3), why a certain <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is finite, and another <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. Because <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the end is always <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>: since the end is desired for its own sake, e.g. health: and thus greater health is more desired, and so on to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>; just as, if a white thing of itself dilates the sight, that which is more white dilates yet more. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the means is not <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the means is in suitable proportion to the end. Consequently those who place their end in <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> have an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>; whereas those who desire <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, on account of the necessities of life, desire a finite measure of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, sufficient for the necessities of life, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Polit. i, 3). The same applies to the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of any other things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Every object of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is taken as something finite: either because it is finite in reality, as being once actually desired; or because it is finite as apprehended. For it cannot be apprehended as <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> is that "from which, however much we may take, there always remains something to be taken" (Phys. iii, 6).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The reason is possessed of <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power, in a certain sense, in so far as it can consider a thing <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a>, as appears in the addition of numbers and lines. Consequently, the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, taken in a certain way, is proportionate to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. In fact the universal which the reason apprehends, is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in a sense, inasmuch as it contains <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a> an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of singulars.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In order that a man be delighted, there is no need for him to realize all that he desires: for he delights in the realization of each object of his <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>.
