<h1>Question 30. Mercy</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3030.htm#article1"> Is evil the cause of mercy on the part of the person pitied?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3030.htm#article2"> To whom does it belong to pity?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3030.htm#article3"> Is mercy a virtue?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3030.htm#article4"> Is it the greatest of virtues?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether evil is properly the motive of mercy?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that, properly speaking, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not the motive of mercy. For, as shown above (19, 1; I-II, 79, 1, ad 4; I, 48, 6), fault is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> rather than punishment. Now fault provokes indignation rather than mercy. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> does not excite mercy.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, cruelty and harshness seem to excel other <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 8) that "harshness does not call for pity but drives it away." Therefore <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as such, is not the motive of mercy.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, signs of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> are not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. But signs of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> excite one to mercy, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Rhet. ii, 8). Therefore <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, properly speaking, is not an incentive to mercy.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 2) that mercy is a kind of sorrow. Now <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is the motive of sorrow. Therefore it is the motive of mercy.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei ix, 5), mercy is heartfelt sympathy for another's distress, impelling us to succor him if we can. For mercy takes its name "misericordia" from denoting a man's compassionate heart [miserum cor] for another's unhappiness. Now unhappiness is opposed to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>: and it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to beatitude or <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> that one should obtain what one wishes; for, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. xiii, 5), "<a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> is he who has whatever he desires, and desires nothing amiss." Hence, on the other hand, it belongs to unhappiness that a man should suffer what he wishes not.

<p>Now a man wishes a thing in three ways: first, by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; thus all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> wish to be and to live: secondly, a man wishes a thing from deliberate choice: thirdly, a man wishes a thing, not in itself, but in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, thus, if a man wishes to eat what is bad for him, we say that, in a way, he wishes to be ill.

<p>Accordingly the motive of "mercy," being something pertaining to "misery," is, in the first way, anything contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, namely corruptive or distressing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, the contrary of which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> desires <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 8) that "pity is sorrow for a visible <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, whether corruptive or distressing." Secondly, such like <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> are yet more provocative of pity if they are contrary to deliberate choice, wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 8) that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> excites our pity "when it is the result of an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, as when something turns out ill, whereas we hoped well of it." Thirdly, they <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> yet greater pity, if they are entirely contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as when <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> befalls a man who has always striven to do well: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 8) that "we pity most the distress of one who suffers undeservedly."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to fault that it be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>; and in this respect it deserves punishment rather than mercy. Since, however, fault may be, in a way, a punishment, through having something connected with it that is against the sinner's will, it may, in this respect, call for mercy. It is in this sense that we pity and commiserate sinners. Thus <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says in a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> (Hom. in Evang. xxxiv) that "<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> godliness is not disdainful but compassionate," and again it is written (<a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse36">Matthew 9:36</a>) that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> "seeing the multitudes, had compassion on them: because they were distressed, and lying like sheep that have no shepherd."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Since pity is sympathy for another's distress, it is directed, properly speaking, towards another, and not to oneself, except figuratively, like <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, according as a man is considered to have various parts (Ethic. v, 11). Thus it is written (<a href="../bible/sir030.htm#verse24">Sirach 30:24</a>): "Have pity on thy own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, pleasing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" [Cf. 106, 3, ad 1].

<p>Accordingly just as, properly speaking, a man does not pity himself, but suffers in himself, as when we suffer cruel treatment in ourselves, so too, in the case of those who are so closely united to us, as to be part of ourselves, such as our children or our parents, we do not pity their distress, but suffer as for our own sores; in which sense the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says that "harshness drives pity away."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Just as pleasure results from hope and <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, so does sorrow arise from the prospect or the recollection of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things; though not so keenly as when they are present to the senses. Hence the signs of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> move us to pity, in so far as they represent as present, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that excites our pity.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the reason for taking pity is a defect in the person who pities?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the reason for taking pity is not a defect in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who takes pity. For it is proper to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be merciful, wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/psa144.htm#verse9">Psalm 144:9</a>): "His tender mercies are over all His works." But there is no defect in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore a defect cannot be the reason for taking pity.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if a defect is the reason for taking pity, those in whom there is most defect, must needs take most pity. But this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 8) that "those who are in a desperate state are pitiless." Therefore it seems that the reason for taking pity is not a defect in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who pities.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to be treated with contempt is to be defective. But the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 8) that "those who are disposed to contumely are pitiless." Therefore the reason for taking pity, is not a defect in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who pities.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Pity is a kind of sorrow. But a defect is the reason of sorrow, wherefore those who are in bad health give way to sorrow more easily, as we shall say further on (35, 1, ad 2). Therefore the reason why one takes pity is a defect in oneself.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since pity is grief for another's distress, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), from the very fact that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> takes pity on anyone, it follows that another's distress grieves him. And since sorrow or grief is about one's own ills, one grieves or sorrows for another's distress, in so far as one looks upon another's distress as one's own.

<p>Now this happens in two ways: first, through union of the affections, which is the effect of love. For, since he who loves another looks upon his friend as another self, he counts his friend's hurt as his own, so that he grieves for his friend's hurt as though he were hurt himself. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. ix, 4) reckons "grieving with one's friend" as being one of the signs of friendship, and the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse15">Romans 12:15</a>): "Rejoice with them that rejoice, weep with them that weep."

<p>Secondly, it happens through real union, for instance when another's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> comes near to us, so as to pass to us from him. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 8) that men pity such as are akin to them, and the like, because it makes them realize that the same may happen to themselves. This also explains why the old and the wise who consider that they may fall upon <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> times, as also feeble and timorous <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, are more inclined to pity: whereas those who deem themselves <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, and so far powerful as to think themselves in no danger of suffering any hurt, are not so inclined to pity.

<p>Accordingly a defect is always the reason for taking pity, either because one looks upon another's defect as one's own, through being united to him by love, or on account of the possibility of suffering in the same way.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> takes pity on us through love alone, in as much as He loves us as belonging to Him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Those who are already in <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> distress, do not fear to suffer more, wherefore they are without pity. On like manner this applies to those also who are in great fear, for they are so intent on their own passion, that they pay no attention to the suffering of others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Those who are disposed to contumely, whether through having been contemned, or because they wish to contemn others, are incited to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and daring, which are manly <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and arouse the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> spirit to attempt difficult things. Hence they make a man think that he is going to suffer something in the future, so that while they are disposed in that way they are pitiless, according to <a href="../bible/pro027.htm#verse4">Proverbs 27:4</a>: "Anger hath no mercy, nor fury when it breaketh forth." For the same reason the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> are without pity, because they despise others, and think them <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, so that they account them as suffering deservedly whatever they suffer. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. in Evang. xxxiv) that "<a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">godliness</a>," i.e. of the proud, "is not compassionate but disdainful."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether mercy is a virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that mercy is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For the chief part of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is choice as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. ii, 5). Now choice is "the desire of what has been already counselled" (Ethic. iii, 2). Therefore whatever hinders counsel cannot be called a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But mercy hinders counsel, according to the saying of Sallust (Catilin.): "All those that take counsel about matters of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, should be free from . . . <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> . . . and mercy, because the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> does not easily see aright, when these things stand in the way." Therefore mercy is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, nothing contrary to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is praiseworthy. But nemesis is contrary to mercy, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Rhet. ii, 9), and yet it is a praiseworthy passion (Rhet. ii, 9). Therefore mercy is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and peace are not special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, because they result from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as stated above (28, 4; 29, 4). Now mercy, also, results from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; for it is out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> that we weep with them that weep, as we rejoice with them that rejoice. Therefore mercy is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, since mercy belongs to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, it is not an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and, since it has not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for its object, neither is it a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Moreover it is not a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, because neither is it about operations, for this belongs to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; nor is it about <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, since it is not reduced to one of the twelve means mentioned by the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. ii, 7). Therefore mercy is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei ix, 5): "Cicero in praising Caesar expresses himself much better and in a fashion at once more humane and more in accordance with religious feeling, when he says: 'Of all thy <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> none is more marvelous or more graceful than thy mercy.'" Therefore mercy is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Mercy signifies grief for another's distress. Now this grief may denote, in one way, a movement of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, in which case mercy is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> but a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>; whereas, in another way, it may denote a movement of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, in as much as one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is displeasing to another. This movement may be ruled in accordance with reason, and in accordance with this movement regulated by reason, the movement of the lower <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> may be regulated. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei ix, 5) that "this movement of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>" (viz. mercy) "obeys the reason, when mercy is vouchsafed in such a way that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is safeguarded, whether we give to the needy or forgive the repentant." And since it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that the movements of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> should be regulated by reason, as was shown above (I-II, 59, A4,5), it follows that mercy is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The words of Sallust are to be understood as applying to the mercy which is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> unregulated by reason: for thus it impedes the counselling of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, by making it wander from <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> is speaking there of pity and nemesis, considered, both of them, as <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. They are contrary to one another on the part of their respective estimation of another's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, for which pity grieves, in so far as it esteems someone to suffer undeservedly, whereas nemesis rejoices, in so far as it esteems someone to suffer deservedly, and grieves, if things go well with the undeserving: "both of these are praiseworthy and come from the same disposition of character" (Rhet. ii, 9). Properly speaking, however, it is <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> which is opposed to pity, as we shall state further on (36, 3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Joy and peace add nothing to the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is the object of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, wherefore they do not require any other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> besides <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. But mercy regards a certain special aspect, namely the misery of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> pitied.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Mercy, considered as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, is a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> having relation to the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, and it is reduced to the mean called nemesis, because "they both proceed from the same character" (Rhet. ii, 9). Now the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proposes these means not as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, but as <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, because, even as <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, they are praiseworthy. Yet nothing prevents them from proceeding from some elective <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, in which case they assume the character of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether mercy is the greatest of the virtues?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that mercy is the greatest of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> seems a most <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> act. But mercy is preferred before the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/hos006.htm#verse6">Hosea 6:6</a> and <a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse7">Matthew 12:7</a>: "I have desired mercy and not sacrifice." Therefore mercy is the greatest <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, on the words of <a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse8">1 Timothy 4:8</a>: "<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">Godliness</a> is profitable to all things," a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "The sum total of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian's</a> rule of life consists in mercy and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">godliness</a>." Now the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> rule of life embraces every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore the sum total of all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> is contained in mercy.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "Virtue is that which makes its subject <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a>. Therefore the more a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> makes a man like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the better is that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is the better for being more like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now this is chiefly the result of mercy, since of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is it said (<a href="../bible/psa144.htm#verse9">Psalm 144:9</a>) that "His tender mercies are over all His works," and (<a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse36">Luke 6:36</a>) <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said: "Be ye . . . merciful, as your Father also is merciful." Therefore mercy is the greatest of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> after saying (<a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse12">Colossians 3:12</a>): "Put ye on . . . as the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> . . . the bowels of mercy," etc., adds (<a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse14">Colossians 3:14</a>): "Above all things have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>." Therefore mercy is not the greatest of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> may take precedence of others in two ways: first, in itself; secondly, in comparison with its subject. On itself, mercy takes precedence of other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, for it belongs to mercy to be bountiful to others, and, what is more, to succor others in their wants, which pertains chiefly to one who stands above. Hence mercy is accounted as being proper to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and therein His omnipotence is declared to be chiefly manifested [Collect, Tenth Sunday after Pentecost].

<p>On the other hand, with regard to its subject, mercy is not the greatest <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, unless that subject be greater than all others, surpassed by none and excelling all: since for him that has anyone above him it is better to be united to that which is above than to supply the defect of that which is beneath. ["The <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of mercy is not strained./'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes/The throned monarch better than his crown." Merchant of Venice, Act IV, Scene i.]. Hence, as regards <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who has <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> above him, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> which unites him to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is greater than mercy, whereby he supplies the defects of his neighbor. But of all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which relate to our neighbor, mercy is the greatest, even as its act surpasses all others, since it belongs to one who is higher and better to supply the defect of another, in so far as the latter is deficient.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> We worship <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by external <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, not for His own profit, but for that of ourselves and our neighbor. For He needs not our <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, but wishes them to be offered to Him, in order to arouse our devotion and to profit our neighbor. Hence mercy, whereby we supply others' defects is a sacrifice more acceptable to Him, as conducing more directly to our neighbor's well-being, according to <a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse16">Hebrews 13:16</a>: "Do not forget to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and to impart, for by such <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> favor is obtained."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The sum total of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> consists in mercy, as regards external works: but the inward love of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, whereby we are united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> preponderates over both love and mercy for our neighbor.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> likens us to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by uniting us to Him in the bond of love: wherefore it surpasses mercy, which likens us to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as regards similarity of works.
