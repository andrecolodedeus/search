<h1>Question 30. The Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/4030.htm#article1"> Was it befitting that announcement should be made to her of that which was to be begotten of her?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4030.htm#article2"> By whom should this announcement be made?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4030.htm#article3"> In what manner should this announcement be made?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4030.htm#article4"> The order observed in the Annunciation</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether it was necessary to announce to the Blessed Virgin that which was to be done in her?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it was unnecessary to announce to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> that which was to be done in her. For there seems to have been no need of the <a href="../cathen/01541c.htm">Annunciation</a> except for the purpose of receiving the Virgin's consent. But her consent seems to have been unnecessary: because the <a href="../cathen/15448a.htm">Virginal Conception</a> was foretold by a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of "<a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>," which is "fulfilled without our consent," as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says on <a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse22">Matthew 1:22</a>. There was no need, therefore, for this <a href="../cathen/01541c.htm">Annunciation</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, for to disbelieve therein excludes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from the way of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; because, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse22">Romans 3:22</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (is) by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>." But one needs no further instruction concerning what one <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> had no need for the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> of her Son to be announced to her.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> conceived <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in her body, so every pious <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> conceives Him spiritually. Thus the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse19">Galatians 4:19</a>): "My little children, of whom I am in labor again, until <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> be formed in you." But to those who conceive Him spiritually no announcement is made of this conception. Therefore neither should it have been announced to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> that she was to conceive the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> in her womb.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is related (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse31">Luke 1:31</a>) that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> said to her: "Behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and shalt bring forth a son."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It was reasonable that it should be announced to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> that she was to conceive Christ. First, in order to maintain a becoming order in the union of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> with the Virgin--namely, that she should be informed in mind concerning Him, before conceiving Him in the flesh. Thus <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Sancta Virgin. iii): "Mary is more blessed in receiving the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, than in conceiving the flesh of Christ"; and further on he adds: "Her nearness as a Mother would have been of no profit to Mary, had she not borne <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in her heart after a more blessed manner than in her flesh."

<p>Secondly, that she might be a more <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> witness of this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, being instructed therein by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>Thirdly, that she might offer to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the free <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of her obedience: which she <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> herself right ready to do, saying: "Behold the handmaid of the Lord."

<p>Fourthly, in order to show that there is a certain <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> wedlock between the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Wherefore in the <a href="../cathen/01541c.htm">Annunciation</a> the Virgin's consent was besought in lieu of that of the entire <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is fulfilled without the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> of our will; not without its consent.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> did indeed <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> explicitly in the future <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>; but, being <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, she did not think such high things of herself. Consequently she required instruction in this matter.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> conception of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is preceded by the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, for as much as "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is by hearing" (<a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse17">Romans 10:17</a>). Yet <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> for certain thereby that he has <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; but he does <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which he has received, is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the annunciation should have been made by an angel to the Blessed Virgin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01541c.htm">Annunciation</a> should not have been made by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to our Blessed Lady. For <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelations</a> to the highest <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are made immediately by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. vii). But the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> is exalted above all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> should have been announced to her by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> immediately, and not by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if in this matter it behooved the common order to be observed, by which Divine things are announced to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; in like manner Divine things are announced to a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> by a man: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse34">1 Corinthians 14:34-35</a>): "Let <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> keep silence in the churches . . . but if they would learn anything, let them ask their husbands at home." Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> should have been announced to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> by some <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: especially seeing that <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>, her husband, was instructed thereupon by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, as is related (<a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse20">Matthew 1:20-21</a>)

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, none can becomingly announce what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not. But the highest <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> did not fully <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>: wherefore <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. vii) that the question, "Who is this that cometh from <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edom</a>?" (<a href="../bible/isa063.htm#verse1">Isaiah 63:1</a>) is to be understood as made by them. Therefore it seems that the announcement of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> could not be made becomingly by any <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, greater things should be announced by messengers of greater dignity. But the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> is the greatest of all things announced by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. It seems, therefore, if it behooved to be announced by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> at all, that this should have been done by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the highest order. But Gabriel is not of the highest order, but of the order of archangels, which is the last but one: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> sings: "We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the archangel Gabriel brought thee a message from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" [<a href="../cathen/03245b.htm">Feast of Purification</a>, B.V.M. ix Resp. Brev. O.P.]. Therefore this announcement was not becomingly made by the archangel Gabriel.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse26">Luke 1:26</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> Gabriel was sent by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," etc.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It was fitting for the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> to be announced to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, for three reasons. First, that in this also might be maintained the order established by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by which Divine things are brought to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> by means of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. iv) that "the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were the first to be taught the Divine <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> kindness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>: afterwards the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> was imparted to us through them. Thus, then, the most god-like Gabriel made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to Zachary that a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> son would be born to him; and, to Mary, how the Divine <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the ineffable conception of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would be realized in her."

<p>Secondly, this was becoming to the restoration of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which was to be effected by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> says in a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> (in Annunt.): "It was an apt beginning of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> restoration that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> should be sent by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to the Virgin who was to be hallowed by the Divine Birth: since the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> ruin was through the serpent being sent by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> to cajole the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> by the spirit of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>."

<p>Thirdly, because this was becoming to the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says in a sermon on the <a href="../cathen/02006b.htm">Assumption</a> [Ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> but not his work]: "It is well that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> be sent to the Virgin; because <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is ever akin to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Surely to live in the flesh and not according to the flesh is not an earthly but a heavenly life."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> was above the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> as regards the dignity to which she was chosen by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But as regards the present state of life, she was beneath the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For even <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself, by reason of His passible life, "was made a little lower than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>," according to <a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse9">Hebrews 2:9</a>. But because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was both wayfarer and comprehensor, He did not need to be instructed by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as regards <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Divine things. The <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, however, was not yet in the state of comprehension: and therefore she had to be instructed by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> concerning the Divine Conception.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a sermon on the <a href="../cathen/02006b.htm">Assumption</a> (De Assump. B.V.M. [Work of another author: among the works of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>) a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> estimation of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> excludes her from certain general rules. For "neither did she 'multiply her conceptions' nor was she 'under <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a>, i.e. her husband's,' power (<a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse16">Genesis 3:16</a>), who in her spotless womb conceived <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." Therefore it was fitting that she should be informed of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> by means not of a man, but of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. For this reason it was made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to her before <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>: since the message was brought to her before she conceived, but to <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> after she had conceived.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As may be gathered from the passage quoted from <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were acquainted with the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>: and yet they put this question, being desirous that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should give them more perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the details of this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, which are incomprehensible to any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Thus Maximus [Maximus of Constantinople] says that "there can be no question that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> was to take place. But it was not given to them to trace the manner of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> conception, nor how it was that He remained whole in the Father, whole throughout the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, and was whole in the narrow abode of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Some say that Gabriel was of the highest order; because <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. de Centum Ovibus [34 in Evang.): "It was right that one of the highest <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> should come, since his message was most sublime." But this does nat imply that he was of the highest order of all, but in regard to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>: since he was an archangel. Thus the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> calls him an archangel, and <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> himself in a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> (De Centum Ovibus 34) says that "those are called archangels who announce sublime things." It is therefore sufficiently credible that he was the highest of the archangels. And, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (De Centum Ovibus 34), this name agrees with his office: for "Gabriel means 'Power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.' This message therefore was fittingly brought by the 'Power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,' because the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a> and mighty in battle was coming to overcome the powers of the air."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the angel of annunciation should have appeared to the Virgin in a bodily vision?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01541c.htm">Annunciation</a> should not have appeared to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin</a> in a bodily vision. For "<a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> vision is more excellent than bodily vision," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii), and especially more becoming to an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>: since by <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> vision an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is seen in his <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>; whereas in a bodily vision he is seen in the bodily shape which he assumes. Now since it behooved a sublime messenger to come to announce the Divine Conception, so, seemingly, he should have appeared in the most excellent kind of vision. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01541c.htm">Annunciation</a> appeared to the Virgin in an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> vision.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision also seems to excel bodily vision: just as the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> is a higher power than the senses. But "the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> . . . appeared to <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> in his sleep" (<a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse20">Matthew 1:20</a>), which was clearly an <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision. Therefore it seems that he should have appeared to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> also in an <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the bodily vision of a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> stupefies the beholder; thus we sing of the Virgin herself: "And the Virgin seeing the light was filled with fear" [Feast of Annunciation, B.V.M. ii Resp. Brev. O.P.]. But it was better that her mind should be preserved from being thus troubled. Therefore it was not fitting that this announcement should be made in a bodily vision.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> in a sermon (De Annunt. iii) pictures the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> as speaking thus: "To me came the archangel Gabriel with glowing countenance, gleaming robe, and wondrous step." But these cannot pertain to other than bodily vision. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01541c.htm">Annunciation</a> appeared in a bodily vision to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01541c.htm">Annunciation</a> appeared in a bodily vision to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>. And this indeed was fitting, first in regard to that which was announced. For the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> came to announce <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> of the invisible <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore it was becoming that, in order to make this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, an invisible creature should assume a form in which to appear visibly: forasmuch as all the apparitions of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> are ordered to that apparition in which the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> appeared in the flesh.

<p>Secondly, it was fitting as regards the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, who was to receive the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> not only in her mind, but in her bodily womb. Therefore it behooved not only her mind, but also her bodily senses to be refreshed by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> vision.

<p>Thirdly, it is in keeping with the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of that which was announced. For we apprehend with greater <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> that which is before our eyes, than what is in our <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>. Thus <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. iv in Matth.) that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> "came to the Virgin not in her sleep, but visibly. For since she was receiving from the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> a message exceeding great, before such an event she needed a vision of great <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">Intellectual</a> vision excels merely <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> and merely bodily vision. But <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> himself says (De Annunt. iii) that <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is more excellent if accompanied by <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision, than if accompanied by only one of them. Now the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> perceived not only the bodily vision, but also the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> illumination. Wherefore this was a more excellent vision. Yet it would have been more excellent if she had perceived the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> himself in his <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> by her <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> vision. But it was incompatible with her state of wayfarer that she should see an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> is indeed a higher power than the exterior sense: but because the senses are the principle of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, the greatest <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> is in them, for the principles of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> must needs always be most certain. Consequently <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>, to whom the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> appeared in his sleep, did not have so excellent a vision as the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says on <a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse11">Luke 1:11</a>: "We are disturbed, and lose our presence of mind, when we are confronted by the presence of a superior power." And this happens not only in bodily, but also in <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision. Wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/gen015.htm#verse12">Genesis 15:12</a>) that "when the sun was setting, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and a great and darksome horror seized upon him." But by being thus disturbed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not harmed to such an extent that therefore he ought to forego the vision of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. First because from the very fact that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is raised above himself, in which <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> his dignity is concerned, his inferior powers are weakened; and from this results the aforesaid disturbance: thus, also, when the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> heat is drawn within a body, the exterior parts tremble. Secondly, because, as <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> says (Hom. iv in Luc.): "The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who appeared, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> hers was a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, first sought to remedy the disturbance of mind to which a man is subject." Wherefore both to Zachary and to Mary, as soon as they were disturbed, he said: "Fear not." For this reason, as we read in the life of Anthony, "it is difficult to discern <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spirits. For if <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> succeed fear, we should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the help is from the Lord: because security of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a sign of present majesty. But if the fear with which we are stricken persevere, it is an enemy that we see."

<p>Moreover it was becoming to virginal modesty that the Virgin should be troubled. Because, as <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says on <a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse20">Luke 1:20</a>: "It is the part of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> to be timid, to fear the advances of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and to shrink from men's addresses."

<p>But others says that as the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> was accustomed to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> visions, she was not troubled at seeing this <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, but with wonder at hearing what the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> said to her, for she did not think so highly of herself. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> does not say that she was troubled at seeing the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, but "at his saying."

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the Annunciation took place in becoming order?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01541c.htm">Annunciation</a> did not take place in becoming order. For the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> results from the child she conceived. But the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> should be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> before the effect. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> should have announced to the Virgin the conception of her child before acknowledging her dignity in greeting her.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> should be omitted in things which admit of no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>; and premised where <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> is possible. But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> seems first to have announced what the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> might <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, and which, because of her <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, would make her ask: "How shall this be done?" and afterwards to have given the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, alleging both the instance of Elizabeth and the omnipotence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01541c.htm">Annunciation</a> was made by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> in unbecoming order.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the greater cannot be adequately <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the less. But it was a greater wonder for a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> than for an old <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to be with child. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> was insufficient to demonstrate the conception of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> from that of an old <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> it is written (<a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse1">Romans 13:1</a>): "Those that are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are well ordered [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Those that are, are ordained of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>']." Now the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> was "sent by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" to announce unto the Virgin, as is related <a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse26">Luke 1:26</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01541c.htm">Annunciation</a> was made by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> in the most perfect order.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01541c.htm">Annunciation</a> was made by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> in a becoming manner. For the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> had a threefold purpose in regard to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin</a>. First, to draw her attention to the consideration of a matter of such moment. This he did by greeting her by a new and unwonted salutation. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> says, commenting on Luke (Hom. vi), that if "she had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that similar words had been addressed to anyone else, she, who had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, would never have been astonished at the seeming strangeness of the salutation." In which salutation he began by asserting her worthiness of the conception, by saying, "Full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>"; then he announced the conception in the words, "The Lord is with thee"; and then foretold the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> which would result to her therefrom, by saying, "Blessed art thou among <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>."

<p>Secondly, he purposed to instruct her about the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, which was to be fulfilled in her. This he did by foretelling the conception and birth, saying: "Behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb," etc.; and by declaring the dignity of the child conceived, saying: "He shall be great"; and further, by making <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the mode of conception, when he said: "The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> shall come upon thee."

<p>Thirdly, he purposed to lead her mind to consent. This he did by the instance of Elizabeth, and by the argument from Divine omnipotence.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> To a <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> mind nothing is more astonishing than to hear its own excellence. Now, wonder is most effective in drawing the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind's</a> attention. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, desirous of drawing the Virgin's attention to the hearing of so great a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, began by praising her.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says explicitly on <a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse34">Luke 1:34</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> did not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> words. For he says: "Mary's answer is more temperate than the words of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. She says: How shall this be? He replies: Whereby shall I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this? He denies that he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a>, since he denies that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> this. She does not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> fulfilment when she asks how it shall be done."

<p><a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, however, seems to assert that she <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a>. For he says (De Qq. Vet. et Nov. Test. qu. li): "To Mary, in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about the conception, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> declares the possibility thereof." But such a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> is one of wonder rather than of unbelief. And so the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> adduces a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, not as a cure for unbelief, but in order to remove her astonishment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (Hexaemeron v): "For this reason had many barren <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> borne children, that the virginal birth might be credible."

<p>The conception of the sterile Elizabeth is therefore adduced, not as a sufficient argument, but as a kind of figurative example.: consequently in support of this instance, the convincing argument is added taken from the Divine omnipotence.
