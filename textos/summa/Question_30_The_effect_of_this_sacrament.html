<h1>Question 30. The effect of this sacrament</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5030.htm#article1"> Does Extreme Unction avail for the remission of sins?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5030.htm#article2"> Is bodily health an effect of this sacrament?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5030.htm#article3"> Does this sacrament imprint a character?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether Extreme Unction avails for the remission of sins?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> does not avail for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For when a thing can be attained by one means, no other is needed. Now repentance is required in the recipient of <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> for the remission of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not remitted by <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, there are no more than three things in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the stain, the debt of punishment, and the remnants of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> does not remit the stain without <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, and this remits <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> even without Unction; nor does it remit the punishment, for if the recipient recover, he is still bound to fulfill the satisfaction enjoined; nor does it take away the remnants of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, since the dispositions remaining from preceding acts still remain, as may easily be seen after recovery. Therefore remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is by no means the effect of <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> takes place, not successively, but instantaneously. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> is not done all at once, since several anointings are required. Therefore the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is not its effect.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/jam005.htm#verse15">James 5:15</a>): "If he be in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, they shall be forgiven him."

<p>Further, every sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> confers <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> effects the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore since <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, its effect is the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Each sacrament was instituted for the purpose of one principal effect, though it may, in consequence, produce other effects besides. And since a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> what it signifies, the principal effect of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> must be gathered from its signification. Now this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is conferred by way of a kind of medicament, even as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is conferred by way of washing, and the purpose of a medicament is to expel sickness. Hence the chief object of the institution of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is to cure the sickness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore, just as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> regeneration, and Penance, a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> resurrection, so <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> healing or cure. Now just as a bodily cure presupposes bodily life in the one who is cured, so does a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> cure presuppose <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life. Hence this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is not an antidote to those defects which deprive <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life, namely. original and mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but is a remedy for such defects as weaken <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> spiritually, so as to deprive him of perfect vigor for acts of the life of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> or of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; which defects consist in nothing else but a certain weakness and unfitness, the result in us of actual or <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. against which weakness <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is strengthened by this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Since, however, this strength is given by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which is incompatible with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it follows that. in consequence, if it finds any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, either mortal or venial, it removes it as far as the guilt is concerned, provided there be no obstacle on the part of the recipient; just as we have stated to be the case with regard to the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> and Confirmation (III, 73, 7; III, 79, 3). Hence, too, James speaks of the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as being conditional, for he says: "If he be in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, they shall be forgiven him," viz. as to the guilt. Because it does not always blot out <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, since it does not always find any: but it always remits in respect of the aforesaid weakness which some call the remnants of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Some, however, maintain that it is instituted chiefly as a remedy for venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which cannot be cured perfectly in this lifetime: for which reason the sacrament of the dying is ordained specially against venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But this does not seem to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, since Penance also blots out venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> sufficiently during this life as to their guilt, and that we cannot avoid them after doing penance, does not cancel the effect of the previous penance; moreover this is part of the weakness mentioned above.

<p>Consequently we must say that the principal effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as to its remnants, and, consequently, even as to its guilt, if it find it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although the principal effect of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> can be obtained without actually receiving that sacrament (either without any sacrament at all, or indirectly by means of some other sacrament), yet it never can be obtained without the purpose of receiving that sacrament. And so, since Penance was instituted chiefly against actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, whichever other sacrament may blot out <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> indirectly, it does not exclude the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of Penance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> remits <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in some way as to those three things. For, although the stain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not washed out without <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, yet this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which it bestows, makes the movement of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> towards <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to be one of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, just as may occur in the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> and Confirmation. Again it diminishes the debt of temporal punishment; and this indirectly, in as much as it takes away weakness, for a strong <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> bears the same punishment more easily than a weak <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Hence it does not follow that the measure of satisfaction is diminished. As to the remnants of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, they do not mean here those dispositions which result from acts, and are inchoate <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> so to speak, but a certain <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> debility in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which debility being removed, though such like <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> or dispositions remain, the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is not so easily prone to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> When many actions are ordained to one effect, the last is formal with respect to all the others that precede, and acts by virtue of them: wherefore by the last anointing is infused <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which gives the sacrament its effect.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether bodily health is an effect of this sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that bodily health is not an effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. For every sacrament is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> remedy. Now a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> remedy is ordained to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> health, just as a bodily remedy is ordained to health of the body. Therefore bodily health is not an effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> always produce their effect in those who approach them in the proper dispositions. Now sometimes the recipient of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> does not receive bodily health, no matter how devoutly he receives it. Therefore bodily health is not its effect.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the efficacy of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is notified to us in the fifth chapter of James. Now healing is ascribed there as the effect, not of the anointing, but of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, for he says: "The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> shall save the sick <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." Therefore bodily healing is not an effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The operation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is more efficacious since <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> than before. Now, before the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, those whom the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> anointed with oil were healed (<a href="../bible/mar006.htm#verse13">Mark 6:13</a>). Therefore unction has its effect now in healing bodies.

<p>Further, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> produce their effect by signifying it. Now <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> signifies and effects a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> washing, through the bodily washing in which it consists outwardly. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> signifies and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> healing through the bodily healing which it effects externally.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Just as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> cleansing from <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> stains by means of a bodily washing, so this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> an inward healing by means of an outward sacramental healing: and even as the baptismal washing has the effect of a bodily washing, since it effects even a bodily cleansing, so too, <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> has the effect of a bodily remedy, namely a healing of the body. But there is a difference, for as much as the bodily washing <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a bodily cleansing by a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> property of the bodily element, and consequently always <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> it, whereas <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a bodily healing, not by a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> property of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but by the Divine power which works reasonably. And since reasonable working never produces a secondary effect, except in so far as it is required for the principal effect, it follows that a bodily healing does not always ensue from this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but only when it is requisite for the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> healing: and then it produces it always, provided there be no obstacle on the part of the recipient.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This objection proves that bodily health is not the principal effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>: and this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. The Reply to the Second Objection is clear from what has been said above (cf. 29, 8).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is the form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> as stated above (29, 8,9). Hence, so far as its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> is concerned, this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> derives from it its efficacy in healing the body.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether this sacrament imprints a character?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> imprints a character. For a character is a distinctive sign. Now just as one who is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> is distinguished from one who is not so is one who is anointed, from one who is not. Therefore, just as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> imprints a character so does <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, there is an anointing in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> or order and Confirmation, as there is in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. But a character is imprinted in those <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Therefore a character is imprinted in this one also.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every sacrament contains something that is a reality only, something that is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> only, and something that is both reality and sacrament. Now nothing in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> can be assigned as both reality and sacrament except a character. Therefore in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> also, a character is imprinted.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> No sacrament that imprints a character is repeated. But this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is repeated as we shall state further on (33). Therefore it does not imprint a character.

<p>Further, a sacramental character <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a distinction among those who are in the present Church. But <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> is given to one who is departing from the present Church. Therefore it does not imprint a character.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A character is not imprinted except in those <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is deputed to some sacred <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. Now this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is for no other purpose than a remedy, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not deputed thereby to do or receive anything <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>. Therefore it does not imprint a character.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A character marks a distinction of . states with regard to duties which have to be performed in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, a distinction which a man does not receive by being anointed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The unction of orders and Confirmation, is the unction of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> whereby a man is deputed to some sacred <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, whereas this unction is remedial. Hence the comparison fails.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, that which is both reality and sacrament is not a character, but a certain inward devotion which is a kind of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> anointing.
