<h1>Question 30. The plurality of persons in God</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1030.htm#article1"> Are there several persons in God?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1030.htm#article2"> How many are they?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1030.htm#article3"> What do the numeral terms signify in God?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1030.htm#article4"> The community of the term "person"</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether there are several persons in God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there are not several <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is "the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of a rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." If then there are several <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, there must be several <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>; which appears to be <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, Plurality of absolute properties does not make a distinction of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, either in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or in ourselves. Much less therefore is this effected by a plurality of relations. But in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is no plurality but of relations (28, 3). Therefore there cannot be several <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (De Trin. i), that "this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> one which has no number." But plurality implies number. Therefore there are not several <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, where number is, there is whole and part. Thus, if in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> a number of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, there must be whole and part in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; which is inconsistent with the divine simplicity.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> says: "One is the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Father, another of the Son, another of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." Therefore the Father, and the Son, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are several <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It follows from what precedes that there are several <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For it was shown above (Question 29, Article 4) that this word "person" signifies in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> a relation as subsisting in the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. It was also established (28, 1) that there are several real relations in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and hence it follows that there are also several realities subsistent in the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; which means that there are several <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The definition of "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>" includes "<a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>," not as meaning the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, but the "suppositum" which is made clear by the addition of the term "<a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>." To signify the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> thus understood, the Greeks use the name "hypostasis." So, as we say, "Three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>," they say "Three hypostases." We are not, however, accustomed to say Three <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, lest we be understood to mean three <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essences</a> or <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, by reason of the equivocal signification of the term.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The absolute properties in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, such as <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and wisdom, are not mutually opposed; and hence, neither are they really distinguished from each other. Therefore, although they subsist, nevertheless they are not several subsistent realities--that is, several <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. But the absolute properties in creatures do not subsist, although they are really distinguished from each other, as whiteness and sweetness; on the other hand, the relative properties in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> subsist, and are really distinguished from each other (28, 3). Hence the plurality of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The supreme unity and simplicity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> exclude every kind of plurality of absolute things, but not plurality of relations. Because relations are predicated relatively, and thus the relations do not import composition in that of which they are predicated, as <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> teaches in the same book.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Number is twofold, simple or absolute, as two and three and four; and number as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in things numbered, as two men and two horses. So, if number in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is taken absolutely or <a href="../cathen/01074a.htm">abstractedly</a>, there is nothing to prevent whole and part from being in Him, and thus number in Him is only in our way of understanding; forasmuch as number regarded apart from things numbered <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> only in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. But if number be taken as it is in the things numbered, in that sense as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in creatures, one is part of two, and two of three, as one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is part of two men, and two of three; but this does not apply to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because the Father is of the same magnitude as the whole <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, as we shall show further on (42, 1 and 4).

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether there are more than three persons in God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there are more than three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the plurality of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> arises from the plurality of the relative properties as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). But there are four relations in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as stated above (Question 28, Article 4), paternity, filiation, common spiration, and procession. Therefore there are four <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not differ from His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> more than from His <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. But in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as love; and another proceeds from His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as Son. Therefore another proceeds from His <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as Word, besides the one Who proceeds from His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as Son; thus again it follows that there are not only three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the more perfect a creature is, the more interior operations it has; as a man has understanding and will beyond other animals. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> excels every creature. Therefore in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> not only is there a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> proceeding from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and another from the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, but also in an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of ways. Therefore there are an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it is from the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the Father that He communicates Himself <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> in the production of a divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. But also in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> produces a divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; and that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> another; and so to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, everything within a determinate number is measured, for number is a measure. But the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are immense, as we say in the <a href="../cathen/02033b.htm">Creed of Athanasius</a>: "The Father is immense, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is immense, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is immense." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are not contained within the number three.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said: "There are three who bear witness in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, the father, the Word, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>" (<a href="../bible/1jo005.htm#verse7">1 John 5:7</a>). To those who ask, "Three what?" we answer, with <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. vii, 4), "Three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>." Therefore there are but three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was explained above, there can be only three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For it was shown above that the several <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are the several subsisting relations really distinct from each other. But a real distinction between the divine relations can come only from relative opposition. Therefore two opposite relations must needs refer to two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>: and if any relations are not opposite they must needs belong to the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Since then paternity and filiation are opposite relations, they belong <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> to two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Therefore the subsisting paternity is the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Father; and the subsisting filiation is the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. The other two relations are not opposed to either of these, but are opposed to each other; therefore these two cannot belong to one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>: hence either one of them must belong to both of the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; or one must belong to one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and the other to the other. Now, procession cannot belong to the Father and the Son, or to either of them; for thus it would follows that the procession of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is generation, wherefrom paternity and filiation are derived, would issue from the procession of love, whence spiration and procession are derived, if the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> generating and the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> generated proceeded from the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> spirating; and this is against what was laid down above (27, 3 and 4). We must frequently admit that spiration belongs to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Father, and to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Son, forasmuch as it has no relative opposition either to paternity or to filiation; and consequently that procession belongs to the other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who is called the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, who proceeds by way of love, as above explained. Therefore only three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Father, the Son, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although there are four relations in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, one of them, spiration, is not separated from the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Father and of the Son, but belongs to both; thus, although it is a relation, it is not called a property, because it does not belong to only one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; nor is it a personal relation--i.e. constituting a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. The three relations--paternity, filiation, and procession--are called personal properties, constituting as it were the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; for paternity is the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Father, filiation is the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Son, procession is the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> proceeding.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> That which proceeds by way of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>, as word, proceeds according to similitude, as also that which proceeds by way of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; thus, as above explained (27, 3), the procession of the divine Word is the very same as generation by way of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But love, as such, does not proceed as the similitude of that whence it proceeds; although in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> love is co-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> as being divine; and therefore the procession of love is not called generation in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is more perfect than other animals, he has more intrinsic operations than other animals, because his perfection is something composite. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who are more perfect and more simple, have fewer intrinsic operations than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, for they have no <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, or feeling, or the like. In <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> only one real operation--that is, His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. How there are in Him two processions was above explained (27, 1, 4).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> This argument would <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> if the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> possessed another <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> apart from the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the Father; for then if the Father produced a divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> by His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> also would do so. But the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> have one and the same <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Nor is there any distinction between them except by the personal relations. So <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> belongs to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as derived from another; and it belongs to the Father, as the principle of its communication to another. The opposition of relation does not allow the relation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> to be joined with the relation of principle of another divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; because He Himself proceeds from the other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> A determinate number, if taken as a simple number, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> only, is measured by one. But when we speak of a number of things as applied to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the notion of measure has no place, because the magnitude of the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is the same (42, 1,4), and the same is not measured by the same.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the numeral terms denote anything real in God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the numeral terms denote something real in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the divine unity is the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. But every number is unity repeated. Therefore every numeral term in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> signifies the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; and therefore it denotes something real in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever is said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of creatures, belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a more eminent manner than to creatures. But the numeral terms denote something real in creatures; therefore much more so in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if the numeral terms do not denote anything real in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and are introduced simply in a negative and removing sense, as plurality is employed to remove unity, and unity to remove plurality; it follows that a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> circle results, confusing the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> and obscuring the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; and this ought not to be. Therefore it must be said that the numeral terms denote something real in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (De Trin. iv): "If we admit companionship"--that is, plurality--"we exclude the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of oneness and of solitude;" and <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Fide i): "When we say one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, unity excludes plurality of gods, and does not imply <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Hence we see that these terms are applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in order to remove something; and not to denote anything positive.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> (Sent. i, D, 24) considers that the numeral terms do not denote anything positive in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but have only a negative meaning. Others, however, assert the contrary.

<p>In order to resolve this point, we may observe that all plurality is a consequence of division. Now division is twofold; one is material, and is division of the continuous; from this results number, which is a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. Number in this sense is found only in material things which have <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. The other kind of division is called formal, and is effected by opposite or diverse forms; and this kind of division results in a multitude, which does not belong to a genus, but is transcendental in the sense in which being is divided by one and by many. This kind of multitude is found only in immaterial things.

<p>Some, considering only that multitude which is a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of discrete <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, and seeing that such kind of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> has no place in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, asserted that the numeral terms do not denote anything real in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but remove something from Him. Others, considering the same kind of multitude, said that as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> according to the strict sense of the word, but not in the sense of its genus (as in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is no such thing as a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>), so number <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the proper sense of number, but not in the sense of its genus, which is <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>.

<p>But we say that numeral terms predicated of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are not derived from number, a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, for in that sense they could bear only a metaphorical sense in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, like other corporeal properties, such as length, breadth, and the like; but that they are taken from multitude in a transcendent sense. Now multitude so understood has relation to the many of which it is predicated, as "one" convertible with "being" is related to being; which kind of oneness does not add anything to being, except a negation of division, as we saw when treating of the divine unity (11, 1); for "one" signifies undivided being. So, of whatever we say "one," we imply its undivided reality: thus, for instance, "one" applied to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> signifies the undivided <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of a man. In the same way, when we speak of many things, multitude in this latter sense points to those things as being each undivided in itself.

<p>But number, if taken as a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, denotes an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> added to being; as also does "one" which is the principle of that number. Therefore the numeral terms in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> signify the things of which they are said, and beyond this they add negation only, as stated (Sent. i, D, 24); in which respect the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> was right (Sent. i, D, 24). So when we say, the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is one, the term "one" signifies the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> undivided; and when we say the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is one, it signifies the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> undivided; and when we say the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are many, we signify those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and their <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> undividedness; for it is of the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of multitude that it should be composed of units.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> One, as it is a transcendental, is wider and more general than <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> and relation. And so likewise is multitude; hence in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> it may mean both <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> and relation, according to the context. Still, the very signification of such names adds a negation of division, beyond <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> and relation; as was explained above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Multitude, which denotes something real in creatures, is a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, and cannot be used when speaking of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: unlike transcendental multitude, which adds only indivision to those of which it is predicated. Such a kind of multitude is applicable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> "One" does not exclude multitude, but division, which <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> precedes one or multitude. Multitude does not remove unity, but division from each of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> which compose the multitude. This was explained when we treated of the divine unity (11, 2).

<p>It must be observed, nevertheless, that the opposite arguments do not sufficiently <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the point advanced. Although the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of solitude is excluded by plurality, and the plurality of gods by unity, it does not follow that these terms express this signification alone. For blackness is excluded by whiteness; nevertheless, the term whiteness does not signify the mere exclusion of blackness.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether this term "person" can be common to the three persons?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that this term "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>" cannot be common to the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. For nothing is common to the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> but the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. But this term "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>" does not signify the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> directly. Therefore it is not common to all three.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the common is the opposite to the incommunicable. But the very meaning of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is that it is incommunicable; as appears from the definition given by <a href="../cathen/13045c.htm">Richard of St. Victor</a> (29, 3, ad 4). Therefore this term "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>" is not common to all the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if the name "person" is common to the three, it is common either really, or <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a>. But it is not so really; otherwise the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> would be one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; nor again is it so <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a>; otherwise <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> would be a universal. But in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is neither universal nor particular; neither genus nor <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as we <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> above (Question 3, Article 5). Therefore this term "person" is not common to the three.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. vii, 4) that when we ask, "Three what?" we say, "Three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>," because what a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is, is common to them.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The very mode of expression itself shows that this term "person" is common to the three when we say "three persons"; for when we say "three men" we show that "man" is common to the three. Now it is clear that this is not community of a real thing, as if one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> were common to the three; otherwise there would be only one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the three, as also one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p>What is meant by such a community has been variously determined by those who have examined the subject. Some have called it a community of exclusion, forasmuch as the definition of "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>" contains the word "incommunicable." Others thought it to be a community of <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, as the definition of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> contains the word "individual"; as we say that to be a "<a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>" is common to horse and ox. Both of these explanations, however, are excluded by the fact that "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>" is not a name of exclusion nor of <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, but the name of a reality. We must therefore resolve that even in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs this name "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>" is common by a community of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, not as genus or <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but as a vague <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> thing. The names of genera and <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> or animal, are given to signify the common natures themselves, but not the intentions of those common <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, signified by the terms "genus" or "<a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>." The vague <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> thing, as "some <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," signifies the common <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> with the determinate mode of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of singular things--that is, something self-subsisting, as distinct from others. But the name of a designated singular thing signifies that which distinguishes the determinate thing; as the name <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> signifies this flesh and this bone. But there is this difference--that the term "some <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" signifies the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> on the part of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, with the mode of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of singular things; while this name "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>" is not given to signify the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> on the part of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but the subsistent reality in that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now this is common in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> to the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, that each of them subsists distinctly from the others in the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Thus this name "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>" is common in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> to the three divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument is founded on a real community.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is incommunicable, yet the mode itself of incommunicable <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> can be common to many.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although this community is <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> and not real, yet it does not follow that in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is universal or particular, or genus, or <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; both because neither in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs is the community of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> the same as community of genus or <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; and because the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> have one being; whereas genus and <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and every other universal are predicated of many which differ in being.
