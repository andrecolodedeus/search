<h1>Question 31. Beneficence</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3031.htm#article1"> Is beneficence an act of charity?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3031.htm#article2"> Should we be beneficent to all?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3031.htm#article3"> Should we be more beneficent to those who are more closely united to us?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3031.htm#article4"> Is beneficence a special virtue?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether beneficence is an act of charity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that beneficence is not an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is chiefly directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now we cannot benefit <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/job035.htm#verse7">Job 35:7</a>: "What shalt thou give Him? or what shall He receive of thy hand?" Therefore beneficence is not an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, beneficence consists chiefly in making <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>. But this belongs to liberality. Therefore beneficence is an act of liberality and not of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, what a man gives, he gives either as being due, or as not due. But a benefit conferred as being due belongs to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> while a benefit conferred as not due, is gratuitous, and in this respect is an act of mercy. Therefore every benefit conferred is either an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, or an act of mercy. Therefore it is not an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> is a kind of friendship, as stated above (23, 1). Now the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> reckons among the acts of friendship (Ethic. ix, 1) "doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," i.e. being beneficent, "to one's friends." Therefore it is an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to others.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Beneficence simply means doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to someone. This <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> may be considered in two ways, first under the general aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and this belongs to beneficence in general, and is an act of friendship, and, consequently, of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: because the act of love includes goodwill whereby a man wishes his friend well, as stated above (23, 1; 27, 2). Now the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> carries into effect if possible, the things it wills, so that, consequently, the result of an act of love is that a man is beneficent to his friend. Therefore beneficence in its general acceptation is an act of friendship or <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p>But if the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does another, be considered under some special aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, then beneficence will assume a special character and will belong to some special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. iv), "love moves those, whom it unites, to a mutual relationship: it turns the inferior to the superior to be perfected thereby; it moves the superior to watch over the inferior:" and in this respect beneficence is an effect of love. Hence it is not for us to benefit <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> Him by obeying Him, while it is for Him, out of His love, to bestow <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things on us.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Two things must be observed in the bestowal of <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>. One is the thing given outwardly, while the other is the inward passion that a man has in the delight of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>. It belongs to liberality to moderate this inward passion so as to avoid excessive desire and love for <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>; for this makes a man more ready to part with his <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>. Hence, if a man makes some great <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, while yet desiring to keep it for himself, his is not a liberal giving. On the other hand, as regards the outward <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, the act of beneficence belongs in general to friendship or <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Hence it does not detract from a man's friendship, if, through love, he give his friend something he would like to I keep for himself; rather does this <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the perfection of his friendship.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Just as friendship or <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> sees, in the benefit bestowed, the general aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, so does <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> see therein the aspect of debt, while pity considers the relieving of distress or defect.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether we ought to do good to all?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that we are not bound to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to all. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 28) that we "are unable to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to everyone." Now <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> does not incline one to the impossible. Therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to all.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/sir012.htm#verse5">Sirach 12:5</a>) "Give to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and receive not a sinner." But many men are sinners. Therefore we need not do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to all.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> dealeth not perversely" (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse4">1 Corinthians 13:4</a>). Now to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to some is to deal perversely: for instance if one were to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to an enemy of the common weal, or if one were to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to an <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, since, by doing so, he would be holding communion with him. Therefore, since beneficence is an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, we ought not to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to all.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse10">Galatians 6:10</a>): "Whilst we have time, let us work <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1, ad 1), beneficence is an effect of love in so far as love moves the superior to watch over the inferior. Now degrees among men are not unchangeable as among <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, because men are subject to many failings, so that he who is superior in one respect, is or may be inferior in another. Therefore, since the love of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> extends to all, beneficence also should extend to all, but according as time and place require: because all acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> must be modified with a view to their due circumstances.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Absolutely speaking it is impossible to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to every single one: yet it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> that one may be bound to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to him in some particular case. Hence <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> binds us, though not actually doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to someone, to be prepared in mind to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to anyone if we have time to spare. There is however a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that we can do to all, if not to each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, at least to all in general, as when we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for all, for unbelievers as well as for the faithful.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In a sinner there are two things, his guilt and his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Accordingly we are bound to succor the sinner as to the maintenance of his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but not so as to abet his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for this would be to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> rather than <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> and the enemies of the common weal are deprived of all beneficence, in so far as this prevents them from doing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. Yet if their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> be in urgent need of succor lest it fail, we are bound to help them: for instance, if they be in danger of death through hunger or thirst, or suffer some like distress, unless this be according to the order of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether we ought to do good to those rather who are more closely united to us?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that we are nor bound to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to those rather who are more closely united to us. For it is written (<a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse12">Luke 14:12</a>): "When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, nor thy kinsmen." Now these are the most closely united to us. Therefore we are not bound to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to those rather who are more closely united to us, but preferably to strangers and to those who are in want: hence the text goes on: "But, when thou makest a feast, call the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, the maimed," etc.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to help another in the battle is an act of very great <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. But a soldier on the battlefield is bound to help a fellow-soldier who is a stranger rather than a kinsman who is a foe. Therefore in doing acts of kindness we are not bound to give the preference to those who are most closely united to us.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, we should pay what is due before conferring gratuitous favors. But it is a man's <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to those who have been <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to him. Therefore we ought to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to our benefactors rather than to those who are closely united to us.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, a man ought to love his parents more than his children, as stated above (Question 26, Article 9). Yet a man ought to be more beneficent to his children, since "neither ought the children to lay up for the parents," according to <a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse14">2 Corinthians 12:14</a>. Therefore we are not bound to be more beneficent to those who are more closely united to us.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 28): "Since one cannot do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to all, we ought to consider those chiefly who by reason of place, time or any other circumstance, by a kind of chance are more closely united to us."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> imitate the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which is established by Divine wisdom. Now the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is such that every <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> agent pours forth its activity first and most of all on the things which are nearest to it: thus fire heats most what is next to it. In like manner <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> pours forth the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> first and most plentifully on the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> which are nearest to Him, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> declares (Coel. Hier. vii). But the bestowal of benefits is an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> towards others. Therefore we ought to be most beneficent towards those who are most closely connected with us.

<p>Now one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> connection with another may be measured in reference to the various matters in which men are engaged together; (thus the intercourse of kinsmen is in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> matters, that of fellow-citizens is in civic matters, that of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> is in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> matters, and so forth): and various benefits should be conferred in various ways according to these various connections, because we ought in preference to bestow on each one such benefits as pertain to the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in which, speaking simply, he is most closely connected with us. And yet this may vary according to the various requirements of time, place, or <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in hand: because in certain cases one ought, for instance, to succor a stranger, in extreme <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, rather than one's own father, if he is not in such urgent need.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> did not absolutely forbid us to invite our friends and kinsmen to eat with us, but to invite them so that they may invite us in return, since that would be an act not of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> but of cupidity. The case may occur, however, that one ought rather to invite strangers, on account of their greater want. For it must be understood that, other things being equal, one ought to succor those rather who are most closely connected with us. And if of two, one be more closely connected, and the other in greater want, it is not possible to decide, by any general rule, which of them we ought to help rather than the other, since there are various degrees of want as well as of connection: and the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> requires the judgment of a <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of many is more Godlike than the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. Wherefore it is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> action for a man to endanger even his own life, either for the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> or for the temporal common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of his country. Since therefore men engage together in warlike acts in order to safeguard the common weal, the soldier who with this in view succors his comrade, succors him not as a private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, but with a view to the welfare of his country as a whole: wherefore it is not a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> for wonder if a stranger be preferred to one who is a blood relation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A thing may be due in two ways. There is one which should be reckoned, not among the goods of the debtor, but rather as belonging to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to whom it is due: for instance, a man may have another's goods, whether in money or in kind, either because he has stolen them, or because he has received them on loan or in deposit or in some other way. In this case a man ought to pay what he owes, rather than benefit his connections out of it, unless perchance the case be so urgent that it would be lawful for him to take another's property in order to relieve the one who is in need. Yet, again, this would not apply if the creditor were in equal distress: in which case, however, the claims on either side would have to be weighed with regard to such other <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> as a <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would take into consideration, because, on account of the different particular cases, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. ix, 2), it is impossible to lay down a general rule.

<p>The other kind of due is one which is reckoned among the goods of the debtor and not of the creditor; for instance, a thing may be due, not because <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> requires it, but on account of a certain moral equity, as in the case of benefits received gratis. Now no benefactor confers a benefit equal to that which a man receives from his parents: wherefore in paying back benefits received, we should give the first place to our parents before all others, unless, on the other side, there be such weightier motives, as need or some other circumstance, for instance the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> or state. On other cases we must take to account the connection and the benefit received; and here again no general rule can laid down.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Parents are like superiors, and so a parent's love tends to conferring benefits, while the children's love tends to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> their parents. Nevertheless in a case of extreme urgency it would be lawful to abandon one's children rather than one's parents, to abandon whom it is by no means lawful, on account of the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> we lie under towards them for the benefits we have received from them, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. viii, 14).

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether beneficence is a special virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that beneficence is a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For precepts are directed to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since lawgivers purpose to make men <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> (Ethic. i 9,13; ii, 1). Now beneficence and love are prescribed as distinct from one another, for it is written (<a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse44">Matthew 4:44</a>): "Love your enemies, do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to them that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> you." Therefore beneficence is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> distinct from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are opposed to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Now there are opposed to beneficence certain <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> whereby a hurt is inflicted on our neighbor, for instance, rapine, <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> and so forth. Therefore beneficence is a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not divided into several <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>: whereas there would seem to be several kinds of beneficence, according to the various kinds of benefits. Therefore beneficence is a distinct <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The internal and the external act do not require different <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Now beneficence and goodwill differ only as external and internal act, since beneficence is the execution of goodwill. Therefore as goodwill is not a distinct <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, so neither is beneficence.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Virtues differ according to the different aspects of their objects. Now the formal aspect of the object of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and of beneficence is the same, since both <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> regard the common aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as explained above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Wherefore beneficence is not a distinct <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, but denotes an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Precepts are given, not about <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> but about acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: wherefore distinction of precept denotes distinction, not of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, but of acts.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Even as all benefits conferred on our neighbor, if we consider them under the common aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, are to be traced to love, so all hurts considered under the common aspect of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, are to be traced to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. But if we consider these same things under certain special aspects of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, they are to be traced to certain special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> or <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, and in this way also there are various kinds of benefits.

<p>Hence the Reply to the Third Objection is evident.
