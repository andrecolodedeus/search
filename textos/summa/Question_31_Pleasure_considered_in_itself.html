<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether delight is a passion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that delight is not a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. ii, 22) distinguishes operation from passion, and says that "operation is a movement in accord with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, while passion is a movement contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." But delight is an operation, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vii, 12; x, 5). Therefore delight is not a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "To be passive is to be moved," as stated in Phys. iii, 3. But delight does not consist in being moved, but in having been moved; for it arises from <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> already gained. Therefore delight is not a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, delight is a kind of a perfection of the one who is delighted; since it "perfects operation," as stated in Ethic. x, 4,5. But to be perfected does not consist in being passive or in being altered, as stated in Phys. vii, 3 and De Anima ii, 5. Therefore delight is not a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei ix, 2; xiv, 5 seqq) reckons delight, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, or gladness among the other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The movements of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, are properly called <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, as stated above (Question 22, Article 3). Now every emotion arising from a sensitive apprehension, is a movement of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>: and this must needs be said of delight, since, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Rhet. i, 11) "delight is a certain movement of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and a sensible establishing thereof all at once, in keeping with the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the thing."

<p>In order to understand this, we must observe that just as in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things some happen to attain to their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> perfections, so does this happen in animals. And though movement towards perfection does not occur all at once, yet the attainment of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> perfection does occur all at once. Now there is this difference between animals and other <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things, that when these latter are established in the state becoming their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, they do not perceive it, whereas animals do. And from this perception there arises a certain movement of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; which movement is called delight. Accordingly by saying that delight is "a movement of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>," we designate its genus. By saying that it is "an establishing in keeping with the thing's <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>," i.e. with that which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in the thing, we assign the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of delight, viz. the presence of a becoming <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. By saying that this establishing is "all at once," we mean that this establishing is to be understood not as in the process of establishment, but as in the fact of complete establishment, in the term of the movement, as it were: for delight is not a "becoming" as <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> [Phileb. 32,33 maintained, but a "complete fact," as stated in Ethic. vii, 12. Lastly, by saying that this establishing is "sensible," we exclude the perfections of insensible things wherein there is no delight. It is therefore evident that, since delight is a movement of the animal <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> arising from an apprehension of sense, it is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Connatural operation, which is unhindered, is a second perfection, as stated in De Anima ii, 1: and therefore when a thing is established in its proper connatural and unhindered operation, delight follows, which consists in a state of completion, as observed above. Accordingly when we say that delight is an operation, we designate, not its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, but its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A twofold movement is to be observed in an animal: one, according to the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the end, and this belongs to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; the other, according to the execution, and this belongs to the external operation. And so, although in him who has already gained the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in which he delights, the movement of execution ceases, by which the tends to the end; yet the movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> faculty does not cease, since, just as before it desired that which it had not, so afterwards does it delight in that which is possesses. For though delight is a certain repose of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, if we consider the presence of the pleasurable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that satisfies the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, nevertheless there remains the impression made on the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> by its object, by reason of which delight is a kind of movement.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although the name of passion is more appropriate to those <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> which have a corruptive and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> tendency, such as bodily ailments, as also sadness and fear in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; yet some <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> have a tendency to something <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as stated above (23, 1,4): and in this sense delight is called a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether delight is in time?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that delight is in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. For "delight is a kind of movement," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. i, 11). But all movement is in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Therefore delight is in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a thing is said to last long and to be morose in respect of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. But some pleasures are called morose. Therefore pleasure is in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are of one same genus. But some <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Therefore delight is too.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. x, 4) that "no one takes pleasure according to time."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing may be in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> in two ways: first, by itself; secondly, by reason of something else, and <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> as it were. For since time is the measure of successive things, those things are of themselves said to be in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, to which succession or something pertaining to succession is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a>: such are movement, repose, speech and such like. On the other hand, those things are said to be in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, by reason of something else and not of themselves, to which succession is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a>, but which are subject to something successive. Thus the fact of being a man is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> something successive; since it is not a movement, but the term of a movement or change, viz. of this being begotten: yet, because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human being</a> is subject to changeable <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, in this respect, to be a man is in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>.

<p>Accordingly, we must say that delight, of itself indeed, is not in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>: for it regards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> already gained, which is, as it were, the term of the movement. But if this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> gained be subject to change, the delight therein will be in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>: whereas if it be altogether unchangeable, the delight therein will not be in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, either by reason of itself or <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated in De Anima iii, 7, movement is twofold. One is "the act of something imperfect, i.e. of something <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, as such": this movement is successive and is in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Another movement is "the act of something perfect, i.e. of something <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in act," e.g. to understand, to feel, and to will and such like, also to have delight. This movement is not successive, nor is it of itself in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Delight is said to be long lasting or morose, according as it is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> have not for their object a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> obtained, as delight has. Wherefore there is more of the movement of the imperfect in them than in delight. And consequently it belongs more to delight not to be in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether delight differs from joy?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that delight is altogether the same as <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. Because the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> differ according to their objects. But delight and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> have the same object, namely, a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> obtained. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is altogether the same as delight.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, one movement does not end in two terms. But one and the same movement, that of desire, ends in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and delight. Therefore delight and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> are altogether the same.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> differs from delight, it seems that there is equal reason for distinguishing <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">gladness</a>, exultation, and cheerfulness from delight, so that they would all be various <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But this seems to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> does not differ from delight.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> We do not speak of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in irrational animals; whereas we do speak of delight in them. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is not the same as delight.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Joy, as <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a> states (De Anima iv), is a kind of delight. For we must observe that, just as some <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a> are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, and some not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, but consequent to reason, as stated above (Question 30, Article 3), so also some delights are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, and some are not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> but rational. Or, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. ii, 13) and <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> [Nemesius, De Nat. Hom. xviii.] put it, "some delights are of the body, some are of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>"; which amounts to the same. For we take delight both in those things which we desire <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, when we get them, and in those things which we desire as a result of reason. But we do not speak of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> except when delight follows reason; and so we do not ascribe <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> to irrational animals, but only delight.

<p>Now whatever we desire <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, can also be the object of reasoned desire and delight, but not vice versa. Consequently whatever can be the object of delight, can also be the object of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in rational beings. And yet everything is not always the object of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>; since sometimes one feels a certain delight in the body, without rejoicing thereat according to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. And accordingly delight extends to more things than does <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Since the object of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is an apprehended <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, diversity of apprehension pertains, in a way, to diversity of the object. And so delights of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which are also called <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joys</a>, are distinct from bodily delights, which are not called otherwise than delights: as we have observed above in regard to <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a> (30, 3, ad 2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A like difference is to be observed in <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a> also: so that delight corresponds to <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, while <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> corresponds to desire, which seems to pertain more to <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Hence there is a difference of repose corresponding to the difference of movement.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> These other names pertaining to delight are derived from the effects of delight; for "laetitia" [<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">gladness</a>] is derived from the "dilation" of the heart, as if one were to say "latitia"; "exultation" is derived from the exterior signs of inward delight, which appear outwardly in so far as the inward <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> breaks forth from its bounds; and "cheerfulness" is so called from certain special signs and effects of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">gladness</a>. Yet all these names seem to belong to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>; for we do not employ them save in speaking of rational beings.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether delight is in the intellectual appetite?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that delight is not in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Because the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. i, 11) that "delight is a sensible movement." But sensible movement is not in an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> power. Therefore delight is not in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, delight is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>. But every <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> is in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Therefore delight is only in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, delight is common to us and to the irrational animals. Therefore it is not elsewhere than in that power which we have in common with irrational animals.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa036.htm#verse4">Psalm 36:4</a>): "Delight in the Lord." But the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> cannot reach to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; only the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> can. Therefore delight can be in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), a certain delight arises from the apprehension of the reason. Now on the reason apprehending something, not only the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is moved, as regards its application to some particular thing, but also the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, which is called the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. And accordingly in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> or will there is that delight which is called <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, but not bodily delight.

<p>However, there is this difference of delight in either power, that delight of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is accompanied by a bodily transmutation, whereas delight of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is nothing but the mere movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 6) that "desire and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> are nothing else but a volition of consent to the things we wish."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In this definition of the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a>, he uses the word "sensible" in its wide acceptation for any kind of perception. For he says (Ethic. x, 4) that "delight is attendant upon every sense, as it is also upon every act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>." Or we may say that he is defining delight of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Delight has the character of passion, properly speaking, when accompanied by bodily transmutation. It is not thus in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, but according to simple movement: for thus it is also in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 14) that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> rejoices by one simple act": and <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says at the end of De Coel. Hier., that "the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are not susceptible to our passible delight, but rejoice together with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with the gladness of incorruption."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In us there is delight, not only in common with dumb animals, but also in common with <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (De Coel. Hier.) that "<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men often take part in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> delights." Accordingly we have delight, not only in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, which we have in common with dumb animals, but also in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, which we have in common with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether bodily and sensible pleasures are greater than spiritual and intellectual pleasures?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that bodily and sensible pleasures are greater than <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and intelligible pleasures. For all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> seek some pleasure, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. x, 2,4). But more seek sensible pleasures, than intelligible <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> pleasures. Therefore bodily pleasures are greater.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the greatness of a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by its effect. But bodily pleasures have greater effects; since "they alter the state of the body, and in some they <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>" (Ethic. vii, 3). Therefore bodily pleasures are greater.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, bodily pleasures need to be tempered and checked, by reason of their vehemence: whereas there is no need to check <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> pleasures. Therefore bodily pleasures are greater.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa118.htm#verse103">Psalm 118:103</a>): "How sweet are Thy words to my palate; more than honey to my mouth!" And the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. x, 7) that "the greatest pleasure is derived from the operation of wisdom."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), pleasure arises from union with a suitable object perceived or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Now, in the operations of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, especially of the sensitive and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, it must be noted that, since they do not pass into outward <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, they are acts or perfections of the agent, e.g. to understand, to feel, to will and the like: because actions which pass into outward <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, are actions and perfections rather of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> transformed; for "movement is the act produced by the mover in the thing moved" (Phys. iii, 3). Accordingly the aforesaid actions of the sensitive and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, are themselves a certain <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the agent, and are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by sense and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Wherefore from them also does pleasure arise, and not only from their objects.

<p>If therefore we compare <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> pleasures with sensible pleasures, according as we delight in the very actions, for instance in sensitive and in <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> pleasures are much greater than sensible pleasures. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> takes much more delight in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> something, by understanding it, than in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> something by perceiving it with his sense. Because <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is more perfect; and because it is better <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> reflects on its own act more than sense does. Moreover <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is more beloved: for there is no one who would not forfeit his bodily sight rather than his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> vision, as beasts or fools are deprived thereof, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in De Civ. Dei (De Trin. xiv, 14).

<p>If, however, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> pleasures be compared with sensible bodily pleasures, then, in themselves and absolutely speaking, <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> pleasures are greater. And this appears from the consideration of the three things needed for pleasure, viz. the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is brought into conjunction, that to which it is conjoined, and the conjunction itself. For <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is both greater and more beloved than bodily <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: a sign whereof is that men abstain from even the greatest bodily pleasures, rather than suffer loss of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> which is an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Likewise the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> faculty is much more noble and more <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> than the sensitive faculty. Also the conjunction is more intimate, more perfect and more firm. More intimate, because the senses stop at the outward <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> of a thing, whereas the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> penetrates to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; for the object of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is "what a thing is." More perfect, because the conjunction of the sensible to the sense implies movement, which is an imperfect act: wherefore sensible pleasures are not perceived all at once, but some part of them is passing away, while some other part is looked forward to as yet to be realized, as is manifest in pleasures of the table and in sexual pleasures: whereas intelligible things are without movement: hence pleasures of this kind are realized all at once. More firm; because the objects of bodily pleasure are corruptible, and soon pass away; whereas <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods are incorruptible.

<p>On the other hand, in relation to us, bodily pleasures are more vehement, for three reasons. First, because sensible things are more <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us, than intelligible things. Secondly, because sensible pleasures, through being <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, are accompanied by some alteration in the body: whereas this does not occur in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> pleasures, save by reason of a certain reaction of the superior <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> on the lower. Thirdly, because bodily pleasures are sought as remedies for bodily defects or troubles, whence various griefs arise. Wherefore bodily pleasures, by reason of their succeeding griefs of this kind, are felt the more, and consequently are welcomed more than <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> pleasures, which have no contrary griefs, as we shall state farther on (35, 5).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The reason why more seek bodily pleasures is because sensible goods are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> better and more generally: and, again, because men need pleasures as remedies for many kinds of sorrow and sadness: and since the majority cannot attain <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> pleasures, which are proper to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, hence it is that they turn aside to seek those of the body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Bodily transmutation arises more from bodily pleasures, inasmuch as they are <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Bodily pleasures are realized in the sensitive faculty which is governed by reason: wherefore they need to be tempered and checked by reason. But <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> pleasures are in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which is itself the rule: wherefore they are in themselves both sober and moderate.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the pleasures of touch are greater than the pleasures afforded by the other senses?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the pleasures of touch are not greater than the pleasures afforded by the other senses. Because the greatest pleasure seems to be that without which all <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is at an end. But such is the pleasure afforded by the sight, according to the words of <a href="../bible/tob005.htm#verse12">Tobit 5:12</a>: "What manner of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> shall be to me, who sit in darkness, and see not the light of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>?" Therefore the pleasure afforded by the sight is the greatest of sensible pleasures.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "every one finds treasure in what he loves," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. i, 11). But "of all the senses the sight is loved most" [Metaph. i, 1. Therefore the greatest pleasure seems to be afforded by sight.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the beginning of friendship which is for the sake of the pleasant is principally sight. But pleasure is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of such friendship. Therefore the greatest pleasure seems to be afforded by sight.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 10), that the greatest pleasures are those which are afforded by the touch.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (25, 2, ad 1; 27, 4, ad 1), everything gives pleasure according as it is loved. Now, as stated in Metaph. i, 1, the senses are loved for two reasons: for the purpose of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and on account of their usefulness. Wherefore the senses afford pleasure in both these ways. But because it is proper to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to apprehend <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> itself as something <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it follows that the former pleasures of the senses, i.e. those which arise from <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, are proper to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: whereas pleasures of the senses, as loved for their usefulness, are common to all animals.

<p>If therefore we speak of that sensible pleasure by which reason of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, it is evident that the sight affords greater pleasure than any other sense. On the other hand, if we speak of that sensible pleasure which is by reason of usefulness, then the greatest pleasure is afforded by the touch. For the usefulness of sensible things is gauged by their relation to the preservation of the animal's <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now the sensible objects of touch bear the closest relation to this usefulness: for the touch takes cognizance of those things which are vital to an animal, namely, of things hot and cold and the like. Wherefore in this respect, the pleasures of touch are greater as being more closely related to the end. For this reason, too, other animals which do not experience sensible pleasure save by reason of usefulness, derive no pleasure from the other senses except as subordinated to the sensible objects of the touch: "for dogs do not take delight in the smell of hares, but in eating them; . . . nor does the lion feel pleasure in the lowing of an ox, but in devouring it" (Ethic. iii, 10).

<p>Since then the pleasure afforded by touch is the greatest in respect of usefulness, and the pleasure afforded by sight the greatest in respect of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; if anyone wish to compare these two, he will find that the pleasure of touch is, absolutely speaking, greater than the pleasure of sight, so far as the latter remains within the limits of sensible pleasure. Because it is evident that in everything, that which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> is most powerful: and it is to these pleasures of the touch that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a>, such as those of food, sexual union, and the like, are ordained. If, however, we consider the pleasures of sight, inasmuch sight is the handmaid of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, then the pleasures of sight are greater, forasmuch as <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> pleasures are greater than sensible.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Joy, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), denotes pleasure of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and this belongs principally to the sight. But <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> pleasure belongs principally to the touch.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The sight is loved most, "on account of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, because it helps us to distinguish many things," as is stated in the same passage (Metaph. i, 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Pleasure <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> carnal love in one way; the sight, in another. For pleasure, especially that which is afforded by the touch, is the final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the friendship which is for the sake of the pleasant: whereas the sight is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> like that from which a movement has its beginning, inasmuch as the beholder on seeing the lovable object receives an impression of its image, which entices him to love it and to seek its delight.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether any pleasure is not natural?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that no pleasure is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>. For pleasure is to the emotions of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> what repose is to bodies. But the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> body does not repose save in a connatural place. Neither, therefore, can the repose of the animal <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, which is pleasure, be elsewhere than in something connatural. Therefore no pleasure is non-<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, what is against <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a>. But "whatever is <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> grief" (Metaph. v, 5). Therefore nothing which is unnatural can give pleasure.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the fact of being established in one's own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, if perceived, gives rise to pleasure, as is evident from the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher's</a> definition quoted above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). But it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to every thing to be established in its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; because <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> movement tends to a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> end. Therefore every pleasure is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 5,6) that some things are pleasant "not from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> but from disease."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We speak of that as being <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, which is in accord with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as stated in Phys. ii, 1. Now, in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> can be taken in two ways. First, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and reason is the principal part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, since in respect thereof he has his own specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. And in this sense, those pleasures may be called <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, which are derived from things pertaining to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in respect of his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>: for instance, it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to take pleasure in contemplating the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and in doing works of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Secondly, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may be taken as contrasted with reason, and as denoting that which is common to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and other animals, especially that part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> which does not obey reason. And in this sense, that which pertains to the preservation of the body, either as regards the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, as food, drink, sleep, and the like, or as regards the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as sexual intercourse, are said to afford <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> pleasure. Under each kind of pleasures, we find some that are "not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>" speaking absolutely, and yet "connatural" in some respect. For it happens in an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> that some one of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> principles of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is corrupted, so that something which is contrary to the specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, becomes <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to this <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>: thus it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to this hot water to give heat. Consequently it happens that something which is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, either in regard to reason, or in regard to the preservation of the body, becomes connatural to this <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, on account of there being some corruption of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in him. And this corruption may be either on the part of the body--from some ailment; thus to a man suffering from fever, sweet things seem bitter, and vice versa--or from an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> temperament; thus some take pleasure in eating earth and coals and the like; or on the part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; thus from custom some take pleasure in cannibalism or in the unnatural intercourse of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and beast, or other such things, which are not in accord with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p>This suffices for the answers to the objections.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether one pleasure can be contrary to another?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one pleasure cannot be contrary to another. Because the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> derive their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and contrariety from their objects. Now the object of pleasure is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Since therefore <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is not contrary to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is contrary to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," as stated in Praedic. viii; it seems that one pleasure is not contrary to another.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to one thing there is one contrary, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in Metaph. x, 4. But sadness is contrary to pleasure. Therefore pleasure is not contrary to pleasure.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if one pleasure is contrary to another, this is only on account of the contrariety of the things which give pleasure. But this difference is material: whereas contrariety is a difference of form, as stated in Metaph. x, 4. Therefore there is no contrariety between one pleasure and another.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Things of the same genus that impede one another are contraries, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Phys. viii, 8). But some pleasures impede one another, as stated in Ethic. x, 5. Therefore some pleasures are contrary to one another.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Pleasure, in the emotions of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, is likened to repose in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> bodies, as stated above (Question 23, Article 4). Now one repose is said to be contrary to another when they are in contrary termini; thus, "repose in a high place is contrary to repose in a low place" (Phys. v, 6). Wherefore it happens in the emotions of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that one pleasure is contrary to another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This saying of the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> is to be understood of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as applied to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>: because one <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> may be contrary to another <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, whereas no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> can be contrary to another <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But in other things nothing prevents one <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> from being contrary to another, such as hot and cold, of which the former is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in relation to fire, the latter, in relation to water. And in this way one pleasure can be contrary to another. That this is impossible with regard to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, is due to the fact that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> depends on fittingness in relation to some one thing--i.e. the reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Pleasure, in the emotions of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, is likened to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> repose in bodies: because its object is something suitable and connatural, so to speak. But sadness is like a <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> repose; because its object is disagreeable to the animal <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, just as the place of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> repose is disagreeable to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> repose is contrary both to <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> repose of the same body, and to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> repose of another, as stated in Phys. v, 6. Wherefore pleasure is contrary to both to another pleasure and to sadness.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The things in which we take pleasure, since they are the objects of pleasure, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> not only a material, but also a formal difference, if the formality of pleasurableness be different. Because difference in the formal object <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a specific difference in acts and <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, as stated above (23, 1,4; 30, 2).
