<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the flesh of Christ was derived from Adam?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh was not derived from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse47">1 Corinthians 15:47</a>): "The first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was of the earth, earthly: the second <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, heavenly." Now, the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>: and the second <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not derived from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, but has an origin distinct from him.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the conception of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should have been most <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a>. But it is a greater <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> to form <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> body from the slime of the earth, than from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> derived from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>. It seems therefore unfitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should take flesh from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>. Therefore the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should not have been formed from the mass of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> derived from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, but of some other <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, by "one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered into this world," i.e. by <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, because in him all nations <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> originally, as is clear from <a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse12">Romans 5:12</a>. But if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was derived from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, He would have been in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> originally when he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>: therefore he would have contracted <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>; which is unbecoming in His purity. Therefore the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not formed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> derived from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse16">Hebrews 2:16</a>): "Nowhere doth He"--that is, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>--"take hold of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>: but of the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> He taketh hold." But the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was derived from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was formed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> derived from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> assumed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in order to cleanse it of corruption. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> did not need to be cleansed save in as far as it was soiled in its tainted origin whereby it was descended from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>. Therefore it was becoming that He should assume flesh of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> derived from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> itself might be healed by the assumption.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The second <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, i.e. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, is said to be of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, not indeed as to the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> from which His body was formed, but either as to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> whereby it was formed; or even as to His very Godhead. But as to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was earthly, as <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam's</a> body was.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above (29, 1, ad 2) the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> is <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a>, not as ordained to strengthen <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but as an <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">article of faith</a>. And therefore in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> we do not seek that which is most <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a>, as in those <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> that are wrought for the confirmation of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>' but what is most becoming to Divine wisdom, and most expedient to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, since this is what we seek in all matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p>It may also be said that in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> is not only in reference to the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the conception, but rather in respect of the manner of the conception and birth; inasmuch as a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> conceived and gave birth to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (15, 1, ad 2), <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> in respect of a bodily <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>--that is to say, that the corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was derived from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>: but it was not there by reason of seminal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, because it was not conceived from the seed of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Thus it did not contract <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, as others who are descended from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> seed.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether Christ took flesh of the seed of David?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not take flesh of the seed of David. For Matthew, in tracing the genealogy of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, brings it down to <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> was not Christ's father, as shown above (28, 1, ad 1,2). Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not descended from David.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> was of the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">tribe of Levi</a>, as related <a href="../bible/exo006.htm">Exodus 6</a>. Now Mary the Mother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is called the cousin of Elizabeth, who was a daughter of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, as is clear from <a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse5">Luke 1:5-36</a>. Therefore, since David was of the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Juda</a>, as is shown <a href="../bible/mat001.htm">Matthew 1</a>, it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not descended from David.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written of Jechonias (<a href="../bible/jer022.htm#verse30">Jeremiah 22:30</a>): "Write this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> barren . . . for there shall not be a man of his seed that shall sit upon the throne of David." Whereas of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> it is written (<a href="../bible/isa009.htm#verse7">Isaiah 9:7</a>): "He shall sit upon the throne of David." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not of the seed of Jechonias: nor, consequently, of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of David, since Matthew traces the genealogy from David through Jechonias.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse3">Romans 1:3</a>): "Who was made to him of the seed of David according to the flesh."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is said to have been the son especially of two of the patriarchs, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and David, as is clear from <a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse1">Matthew 1:1</a>. There are many reasons for this. First to these especially was the promise made concerning <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For it was said to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> (<a href="../bible/gen022.htm#verse18">Genesis 22:18</a>): "In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed": which words the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> expounds of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse16">Galatians 3:16</a>): "To <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> were the promises made and to his seed. He saith not, 'And to his seeds' as of many; but as of one, 'And to thy seed,' which is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." And to David it was said (<a href="../bible/psa131.htm#verse11">Psalm 131:11</a>): "Of the fruit of thy womb I will set upon thy throne." Wherefore the Jewish people, receiving Him with kingly <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, said (<a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse9">Matthew 21:9</a>): "Hosanna to the Son of David."

<p>A second reason is because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was to be king, <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>; which is clear from the Lord saying unto him (<a href="../bible/gen015.htm#verse9">Genesis 15:9</a>): "Take thee [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Me'] a cow of three years old," etc. He was also a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, according to <a href="../bible/gen020.htm#verse7">Genesis 20:7</a>: "He is a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>; and he shall <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for thee." Lastly David was both king and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>.

<p>A third reason is because <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> had its beginning in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>: while in David <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> election was most clearly made manifest, according to <a href="../bible/1sa013.htm#verse14">1 Samuel 13:14</a>: "The Lord hath sought Him a man according to His own heart." And consequently <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is called in a most special way the Son of both, in order to show that He came for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> both of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Faustus the Manichean argued thus, in the desire to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not the Son of David, because He was not conceived of <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>, in whom Matthew's genealogy terminates. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> answered this argument thus (Contra Faust. xxii): "Since the same <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> affirms that <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> was Mary's husband and that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> mother was a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, and that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was of the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, what must we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, but that Mary was not a stranger to the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of David: and that it is not without reason that she was called the wife of <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>, by reason of the close alliance of their hearts, although not mingled in the flesh; and that the genealogy is traced down to <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> rather than to her by reason of the dignity of the husband? So therefore we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that Mary was also of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of David: because we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, which assert both that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was of the seed of David according to the flesh, and that Mary was His Mother, not by sexual intercourse but retaining her <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>." For as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on <a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse18">Matthew 1:18</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> and Mary were of the same tribe: wherefore he was bound by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to marry her as she was his kinswoman. Hence it was that they were enrolled together at Bethlehem, as being descended from the same stock."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory of Nazianzum</a> answers this objection by saying that it happened by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will, that the royal <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> was united to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> race, so that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who is both king and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, should be born of both according to the flesh. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, who was the first <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> according to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> a wife of the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Juda</a>, Elizabeth, daughter of Aminadab. It is therefore possible that Elizabeth's father <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> a wife of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of David, through whom the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin Mary</a>, who was of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of David, would be a cousin of Elizabeth. or conversely, and with greater likelihood, that the Blessed Mary's father, who was of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of David, <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> a wife of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>.

<p>Again, it may be said with <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Contra Faust. xxii) that if Joachim, Mary's father, was of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> (as the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> Faustus pretended to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> from certain <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> writings), then we must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/08406b.htm">Joachim's</a> mother, or else his wife, was of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of David, so long as we say that Mary was in some way descended from David.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says on <a href="../bible/luk003.htm#verse25">Luke 3:25</a>, this prophetical passage does not deny that a posterity will be born of the seed of Jechonias. And so <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is of his seed. Neither is the fact that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> reigned contrary to <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, for He did not reign with worldly <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>; since He declared: "My kingdom is not of this world."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether Christ's genealogy is suitably traced by the evangelists?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> genealogy is not suitably traced by the Evangelists. For it is written (<a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse8">Isaiah 53:8</a>): "Who shall declare His generation?" Therefore Christ's genealogy should not have been set down.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot possibly have two fathers. But Matthew says that "<a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> begot <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>, the husband of Mary": whereas Luke says that <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> was the son of Heli. Therefore they contradict one another.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, there seem to be divergencies between them on several points. For Matthew, at the commencement of his book, beginning from <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and coming down to <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>, enumerates forty-two generations. Whereas Luke sets down Christ's genealogy after His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, and beginning from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> traces the series of generations back to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, counting in all seventy-seven generations, the first and last included. It seems therefore that their accounts of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> genealogy do not agree.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, we read (<a href="../bible/2ki008.htm#verse24">2 Kings 8:24</a>) that Joram begot Ochozias, who was succeeded by his son Joas: who was succeeded by his son Amasius: after whom reigned his son Azarias, called Ozias; who was succeeded by his son Joathan. But Matthew says that Joram begot Ozias. Therefore it seems that his account of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> genealogy is unsuitable, since he omits three kings in the middle thereof.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, all those who are mentioned in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> genealogy had both a father and a mother, and many of them had brothers also. Now in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> genealogy Matthew mentions only three mothers--namely, Thamar, Ruth, and the wife of Urias. He also mentions the brothers of <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> and Jechonias, and also Phares and Zara. But Luke mentions none of these. Therefore the evangelists seem to have described the genealogy of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in an unsuitable manner.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The authority of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> suffices.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As is written (<a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse16">2 Timothy 3:16</a>), "All <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Scripture</a> is <a href="../cathen/08045a.htm">inspired</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'All scripture <a href="../cathen/08045a.htm">inspired</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is profitable', etc. Now what is done by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is done in perfect order, according to <a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse1">Romans 13:1</a>: "Those that are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are ordained [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Those that are, are ordained of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>']. Therefore Christ's genealogy is set down by the evangelists in a suitable order.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on <a href="../bible/mat001.htm">Matthew 1</a>, Isaias speaks of the generation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Godhead. Whereas Matthew relates the generation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in His humanity; not indeed by explaining the manner of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, which is also unspeakable; but by enumerating <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> forefathers from whom He was descended according to the flesh.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Various answers have been made by certain writers to this objection which was raised by Julian the Apostate; for some, as <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory of Nazianzum</a>, say that the people mentioned by the two evangelists are the same, but under different names, as though they each had two. But this will not stand: because Matthew mentions one of David's sons--namely, Solomon; whereas Luke mentions another--namely, Nathan, who according to the history of the kings (<a href="../bible/2sa005.htm#verse14">2 Samuel 5:14</a>) were clearly brothers.

<p>Wherefore others said that Matthew gave the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> genealogy of Christ: while Luke gave the supposititious genealogy; hence he began: "Being (as it was supposed) the son of <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>." For among the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> there were some who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that, on account of the crimes of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> would be born of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of David, not through the kings, but through some other line of private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>.

<p>Others again have supposed that Matthew gave the forefathers according to the flesh: whereas Luke gave these according to the spirit, that is, righteous men, who are called (Christ's) forefathers by likeness of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p>But an answer is given in the Qq. Vet. et Nov. Test. [Part i, qu. lvi; part 2, qu. vi] to the effect that we are not to understand that <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> is said by Luke to be the son of Heli: but that at the time of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Heli and <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> were differently descended from David. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is said to have been supposed to be the son of <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>, and also to have been the son of Heli as though (the Evangelist) were to say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, from the fact that He was the son of <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>, could be called the son of Heli and of all those who were descended from David; as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse5">Romans 9:5</a>): "Of whom" (viz. the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>) "is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> according to the flesh."

<p><a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> again gives three solutions (De Qq. Evang. ii), saying: "There are three motives by one or other of which the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> was guided. For either one <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> mentions <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph's</a> father of whom he was begotten; whilst the other gives either his maternal grandfather or some other of his later forefathers; or one was <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> father: the other is father by adoption. Or, according to the Jewish custom, one of those having died without children, a near relation of his <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> his wife, the son born of the latter union being reckoned as the son of the former": which is a kind of legal adoption, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> himself says (De Consensu Evang. ii, Cf. Retract. ii).

<p>This last motive is the truest: <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> also gives it <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse16">Matthew 1:16</a>; and <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius of Caesarea</a> in his Church history (I, vii), says that it is given by Africanus the historian. For these writers says that Mathan and Melchi, at different times, each begot a son of one and the same wife, named Estha. For Mathan, who traced his descent through Solomon, had <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> her first, and died, leaving one son, whose name was <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>: and after his death, as the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> did not forbid his <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> to remarry, Melchi, who traced his descent through Mathan, being of the same tribe though not of the same <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> as Mathan, <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> his <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, who bore him a son, called Heli; so that <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> and Heli were uterine brothers born to different fathers. Now one of these, <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, on his brother Heli dying without issue, <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> the latter's <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, according to the prescription of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, of whom he had a son, <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>, who by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was his own son, but by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was accounted the son of Heli. Wherefore Matthew says "<a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> begot <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>": whereas Luke, who was giving the legal genealogy, speaks of no one as begetting.

<p>And although <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. iv) says that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin Mary</a> was connected with <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> in as far as Heli was accounted as his father, for he says that she was descended from Melchi: yet must we also <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that she was in some way descended from Solomon through those patriarchs enumerated by Matthew, who is said to have set down Christ's genealogy according to the flesh; and all the more since <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> states that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was of the seed of Jechonias.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Consensu Evang. ii) "Matthew purposed to delineate the royal personality of Christ; Luke the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> personality: so that in Matthew's genealogy is signified the assumption of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>": inasmuch as by his carnal origin "He assumed 'the likeness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> flesh.' But in Luke's genealogy the washing away of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is signified," which is effected by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sacrifice. "For which reason Matthew traces the generations downwards, Luke upwards." For the same reason too "Matthew descends from David through Solomon, in whose mother David <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>; whereas Luke ascends to David through Nathan, through whose namesake, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> expiated his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." And hence it is also that, because "Matthew wished to signify that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had condescended to our mortal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, he set down the genealogy of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> at the very outset of his Gospel, beginning with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and descending to <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> and the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself. Luke, on the contrary, sets forth Christ's genealogy not at the outset, but after <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, and not in the descending but in the ascending order: as though giving prominence to the office of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in expiating our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, to which John bore witness, saying: 'Behold Him who taketh away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the world.' And in the ascending order, he passes <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and continues up to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to whom we are reconciled by cleansing and expiating. With reason too he follows the origin of adoption; because by adoption we become children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: whereas by carnal generation the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> became the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>. Moreover he shows sufficiently that he does not say that <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> was the son of Heli as though begotten by him, but because he was adopted by him, since he says that <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was the son of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, inasmuch as he was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p>Again, the number forty pertains to the time of our present life: because of the four parts of the world in which we pass this mortal life under the rule of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And forty is the product of four multiplied by ten: while ten is the sum of the numbers from one to four. The number ten may also refer to the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>; and the number four to the present life; or again to the four <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, according to which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> reigns in us. And thus "Matthew, putting forward the royal personality of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, enumerates forty <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> not counting Him" (cf. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, De Consensu Evang. ii). But this is to be taken on the supposition that it be the same Jechonias at the end of the second, and at the commencement of the third series of fourteen, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> understands it. According to him this was done in order to signify "that under Jechonias there was a certain defection to strange nations during the Babylonian captivity; which also foreshadowed the fact that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> would pass from the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>."

<p>On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> (on <a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse12">Matthew 1:12-15</a>) says that there were two Joachims--that is, Jechonias, father and son: both of whom are mentioned in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> genealogy, so as to make clear the distinction of the generations, which the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> divides into three series of fourteen; which amounts in all to forty-two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Which number may also be applied to the Holy Church: for it is the product of six, which signifies the labor of the present life, and seven, which signifies the rest of the life to come: for six times seven are forty-two. The number fourteen, which is the sum of ten and four, can also be given the same signification as that given to the number forty, which is the product of the same numbers by multiplication.

<p>But the number used by Luke in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> genealogy signifies the generality of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. "For the number ten is shown in the ten precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> to be the number of righteousness. Now, to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is to go beyond the restriction of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. And eleven is the number beyond ten." And seven signifies universality: because "universal time is involved in seven days." Now seven times eleven are seventy-seven: so that this number signifies the generality of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are taken away by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on <a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse8">Matthew 1:8-11</a>: "Because Joram allied himself with the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezabel</a>, therefore his <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> is omitted down to the third generation, lest it should be inserted among the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> predecessors of the Nativity." Hence as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> [Cf. Opus Imperf. in Matth. Hom. i, <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>] says: "Just as great was the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> conferred on <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a>, who wrought vengeance on the house of <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a> and <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezabel</a>, so also great was the curse on the house of Joram, through the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> daughter of <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a> and <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezabel</a>, so that until the fourth generation his posterity is cut off from the number of kings, according to <a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse5">Exodus 20:5</a>: I shall visit [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Visiting'] the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generations."

<p>It must also be observed that there were other kings who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> and are mentioned in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> genealogy: but their impiety was not continuous. For, as it is stated in the book De Qq. Vet. et Nov. Test. qu. lxxxv: "Solomon through his father's <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> is included in the series of kings; and Roboam . . . through the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> of Asa," who was son of his (Roboam's) son, Abiam. "But the impiety of those three [i.e. Ochozias, Joas, and Amasias, of whom <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> asks in this question lxxxv, why they were omitted by St. Matthew] was continuous."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on <a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse3">Matthew 1:3</a>: "None of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are mentioned in the Saviour's genealogy, but only those whom <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> censures, so that He who came for the sake of sinners, by being born of sinners, might blot out all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." Thus Thamar is mentioned, who is censured for her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with her father-in-<a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; Rahab who was a whore; Ruth who was a foreigner; and Bethsabee, the wife of Urias, who was an adulteress. The last, however, is not mentioned by name, but is designated through her husband; both on account of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for he was cognizant of the <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>; and further in order that, by mentioning the husband by name, David's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> might be recalled. And because Luke purposes to delineate <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as the expiator of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, he makes no mention of these <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. But he does mention <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda's</a> brethren, in order to show that they belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> people: whereas Ismael, the brother of <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>, <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob's</a> brother, were cut off from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> people, and for this reason are not mentioned in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> genealogy. Another motive was to show the emptiness of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of birth: for many of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda's</a> brethren were born of hand-maidens, and yet all were patriarchs and heads of tribes. Phares and Zara are mentioned together, because, as <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says on <a href="../bible/luk003.htm#verse23">Luke 3:23</a>, "they are the type of the twofold life of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: one, according to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>," signified by Zara; "the other by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>," of which Phares is the type. The brethren of Jechonias are included, because they all reigned at various times: which was not the case with other kings: or, again, because they were alike in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> and misfortune.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the matter of Christ's body should have been taken from a woman?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body should not have been taken from a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. For the male sex is more noble than the female. But it was most suitable that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should assume that which is perfect in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore it seems that He should not have taken flesh from a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> but rather from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: just as Eve was formed from the rib of a man.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whoever is conceived of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is shut up in her womb. But it ill becomes <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who fills <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth, as is written <a href="../bible/jer023.htm#verse24">Jeremiah 23:24</a>, to be shut up within the narrow limits of the womb. Therefore it seems that He should not have been conceived of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, those who are conceived of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> contract a certain <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>: as it is written (<a href="../bible/job025.htm#verse4">Job 25:4</a>): "Can <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be justified compared with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>? Or he that is born of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> appear clean?" But it was unbecoming that any <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> should be in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: for He is the Wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of whom it is written (<a href="../bible/wis007.htm#verse25">Wisdom 7:25</a>) that "no defiled thing cometh into her." Therefore it does not seem right that He should have taken flesh from a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse4">Galatians 4:4</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> could have taken flesh from whatever <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> He willed, it was nevertheless most becoming that He should take flesh from a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. First because in this way the entire <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was ennobled. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. lxxxiii, qu. 11): "It was suitable that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> liberation should be made manifest in both sexes. Consequently, since it behooved a man, being of the nobler sex, to assume, it was becoming that the liberation of the female sex should be manifested in that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> being born of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>."

<p>Secondly, because thus the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> is made evident. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Incarn. vi): "Thou shalt find in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> many things both <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>. In accordance with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> He was within the womb," viz. of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> body: "but it was above <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> should conceive and give birth: that thou mightest <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who was renewing <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and that He was <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who, according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, was being born of a man." And <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. ad Volus. cxxxvii): "If <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> had <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> a man formed otherwise than in a mother's womb, and had suddenly produced him to sight . . . would He not have strengthened an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> opinion, and made it impossible for us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He had become a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>? And whilst He is doing all things wondrously, would He have taken away that which He accomplished in mercy? But now, He, the mediator between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, has so shown Himself, that, uniting both natures in the unity of one Person, He has given a dignity to ordinary by extraordinary things, and tempered the extraordinary by the ordinary."

<p>Thirdly, because in this fashion the begetting of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is accomplished in every variety of manner. For the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was made from the "slime of the earth," without the concurrence of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>: Eve was made of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> but not of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>: and other men are made from both <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. So that this fourth manner remained as it were proper to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that He should be made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> without the concurrence of a man.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The male sex is more noble than the female, and for this reason He took <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in the male sex. But lest the female sex should be despised, it was fitting that He should take flesh of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Agone Christ. xi): "Men, despise not yourselves: the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> became a man: despise not yourselves, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was born of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> thus (Contra Faust. xxiii) replies to Faustus, who urged this objection; "By no means," says he, "does the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, which <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, according to the flesh, suppose that the same <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was so shut up in His Mother's womb, as to cease to be elsewhere, as though He no longer continued to govern <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth, and as though He had withdrawn Himself from the Father. But you, Manicheans, being of a mind that admits of nought but material images, are utterly unable to grasp these things." For, as he again says (Ep. ad Volus. cxxxvii), "it belongs to the sense of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to form conceptions only through tangible bodies, none of which can be entire everywhere, because they must of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> be diffused through their innumerable parts in various places . . . Far otherwise is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from that of the body: how much more the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body! . . . He is able to be entire everywhere, and to be contained in no place. He is able to come without moving from the place where He was; and to go without leaving the spot whence He came."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There is no <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> in the conception of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, as far as this is the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse15">Acts 10:15</a>): "That which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath cleansed do not thou call common," i.e. unclean. There is, however, a certain <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> therein, resulting from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as far as <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lustful</a> desire accompanies conception by sexual union. But this was not the case with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as shown above (Question 28, Article 1). But if there were any <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> therein, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> would not have been sullied thereby, for He is utterly unchangeable. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Quinque Haereses v): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> saith, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: What is it that troubles thee in My Birth? I was not conceived by <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lustful</a> desire. I made Myself a mother of whom to be born. If the sun's rays can dry up the filth in the drain, and yet not be defiled: much more can the Splendor of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> light cleanse whatever It shines upon, but Itself cannot be sullied."

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the flesh of Christ was conceived of the Virgin's purest blood?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not conceived of the Virgin's purest blood: For it is said in the collect (<a href="../cathen/01542a.htm">Feast of the Annunciation</a>) that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "willed that His Word should take flesh from a Virgin." But flesh differs from blood. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was not taken from the Virgin's blood.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> formed from the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, so <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was formed <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> from the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is not said to have been formed from the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> blood, but rather from his flesh and bones, according to <a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse23">Genesis 2:23</a>: "This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh." It seems therefore that neither should <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body have been formed from the Virgin's blood, but from her flesh and bones.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> as other men's bodies. But other men's bodies are not formed from the purest blood but from the semen and the menstrual blood. Therefore it seems that neither was <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body conceived of the purest blood of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii) that "the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, from the Virgin's purest blood, formed Himself flesh, animated with a rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>), in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> conception His being born of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was in accordance with the laws of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but that He was born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> was above the laws of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now, such is the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that in the generation of an animal the female supplies the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, while the male is the active principle of generation; as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proves (De Gener. Animal. i). But a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who conceives of a man is not a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. And consequently it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> mode of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> generation, that the active principle of generation was the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: but it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> mode of His generation, that the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> from which His body was conceived is similar to the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> which other <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> supply for the conception of their offspring. Now, this matter, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Gener. Animal.), is the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> blood, not any of her blood, but brought to a more perfect stage of secretion by the mother's generative power, so as to be apt for conception. And therefore of such <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> was <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body conceived.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Since the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> was of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as other <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, it follows that she had flesh and bones of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as theirs. Now, flesh and bones in other <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are actual parts of the body, the integrity of which results therefrom: and consequently they cannot be taken from the body without its being corrupted or diminished. But as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> came to heal what was corrupt, it was not fitting that He should bring corruption or diminution to the integrity of His Mother. Therefore it was becoming that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body should be formed not from the flesh or bones of the Virgin, but from her blood, which as yet is not actually a part, but is <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a> the whole, as stated in De Gener. Animal. i. Hence He is said to have taken flesh from the Virgin, not that the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> from which His body was formed was actual flesh, but blood, which is flesh <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated in I, 92, 3, ad 2, <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, through being established as a kind of principle of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, had in his body a certain proportion of flesh and bone, which belonged to him, not as an integral part of his personality, but in regard to his state as a principle of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. And from this was the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> formed, without detriment to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But in the Virgin's body there was nothing of this sort, from which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body could be formed without detriment to His Mother's body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">Woman's</a> semen is not apt for generation, but is something imperfect in the seminal order, which, on account of the imperfection of the female power, it has not been possible to bring to complete seminal perfection. Consequently this semen is not the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of conception; as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Gener. Animal. i): wherefore there was none such in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> conception: all the more since, though it is imperfect in the seminal order, a certain <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> accompanies its emission, as also that of the male semen: whereas in that virginal conception there could be no <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii) that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was not conceived "seminally." But the menstrual blood, the flow of which is subject to monthly periods, has a certain <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> impurity of corruption: like other superfluities, which <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> does not heed, and therefore expels. Of such menstrual blood infected with corruption and repudiated by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the conception is not formed; but from a certain secretion of the pure blood which by a process of elimination is prepared for conception, being, as it were, more pure and more perfect than the rest of the blood. Nevertheless, it is tainted with the impurity of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> in the conception of other men: inasmuch as by sexual intercourse this blood is drawn to a place apt for conception. This, however, did not take place in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> conception: because this blood was brought together in the Virgin's womb and fashioned into a child by the operation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Therefore is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body said to be "formed of the most chaste and purest blood of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin</a>."

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether Christ's body was in Adam and the other patriarchs, as to something signate?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and the patriarchs as to something signate. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. x) that the flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> "by way of a bodily <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>." But bodily <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is something signate. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh was in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and the other patriarchs, according to something signate.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is said (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse3">Romans 1:3</a>) that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> "was made . . . of the seed of David according to the flesh." But the seed of David was something signate in him. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was in David, according to something signate, and for the same reason in the other patriarchs.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> is Christ's kindred, inasmuch as He took flesh therefrom. But if that flesh were not something signate in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, which is descended from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, would seem to have no kindred with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: but rather with those other things from which the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of His flesh was taken. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh was in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and the other patriarchs according to something signate.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. x) that in whatever way <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, other men were there also; but not conversely. But other men were not in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> by way of some signate <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but only according to origin, as stated in I, 119, 1, 2, ad 4. Therefore neither was <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> according to something signate; and, for the same reason, neither was He in the other patriarchs.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (5, ad 1), the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was not the flesh and bones of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, nor anything that was actually a part of her body, but her blood which was her flesh <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a>. Now, whatever was in the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, as received from her parents, was actually a part of her body. Consequently that which the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> received from her parents was not the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body. Therefore we must say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was not in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and the other patriarchs according to something signate, in the sense that some part of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam's</a> or of anyone else's body could be singled out and designated as the very <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> from which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was to be formed: but it was there according to origin, just as was the flesh of other men. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is related to <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and the other patriarchs through the medium of His Mother's body. Consequently <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was in the patriarchs, in no other way than was His Mother's body, which was not in the patriarchs according to signate <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: as neither were the bodies of other men, as stated in I, 119, 1, 2, ad 4.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The expression "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> according to bodily <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>," does not mean that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was a bodily <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>: but that the bodily <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> which He took from the Virgin, was in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> as in its active principle, but not as in its material principle: in other words, by the generative power of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and his descendants down to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, this matter was prepared for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> conception. But this matter was not fashioned into <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body by the seminal power derived from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is said to have been in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> by way of origin, according to bodily <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>: but not according to seminal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was not in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and the other patriarchs, according to seminal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, yet the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin's</a> body was thus in them, through her being conceived from the seed of a man. For this reason, through the medium of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is said to be of the seed of David, according to the flesh, by way of origin.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> are kindred, through the likeness of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Now, specific likeness results not from remote but from proximate <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and from the active principle which begets its like in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Thus, then, the kinship of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> is sufficiently preserved by His body being formed from the Virgin's blood, derived in its origin from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and the other patriarchs. Nor is this kinship affected by the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> whence this blood is taken, as neither is it in the generation of other men, as stated in I, 119, 2, ad 3.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether Christ's flesh in the patriarchs was infected by sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh was not infected by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the patriarchs. For it is written (<a href="../bible/wis007.htm#verse25">Wisdom 7:25</a>) that "no defiled thing cometh into" Divine Wisdom. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the Wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> according to <a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse24">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh was never defiled by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii) that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> "assumed the first-fruits of our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." But in the primitive state <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh was not infected by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh was not infected either in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> or in the other patriarchs.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. x) that "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> ever had, together with the wound, the balm with which to heal it." But that which is infected cannot heal a wound; rather does it need to be healed itself. Therefore in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> there was ever something preserved from infection, from which afterwards <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was formed.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is not related to <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and the other patriarchs, save through the medium of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin's</a> body, of whom He took flesh. But the body of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> was wholly conceived in <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, as stated above (14, 3, ad 1), and thus, as far as it was in the patriarchs, it was subject to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore the flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as far as it was in the patriarchs, was subject to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> When we say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> or His flesh was in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and the other patriarchs, we compare Him, or His flesh, to <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and the other patriarchs. Now, it is manifest that the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the patriarchs differed from that of Christ: for the patriarchs were subject to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, whereas <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was absolutely free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Consequently a twofold <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> may occur on this point. First, by attributing to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or to His flesh, that <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> which was in the patriarchs; by saying, for instance, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, since after some fashion He was in him. But this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>; because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> in such a way that <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> belonged to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: forasmuch as He is not descended from him according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, or according to seminal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; as stated above (1, ad 3, 6, ad 1; 15, 1, ad 2).

<p>Secondly, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> may occur by attributing the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> or of His flesh to that which was actually in the patriarchs: by saying, for instance, that, because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh, as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, was not subject to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, therefore in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> also and in the patriarchs there was some part of his body that was not subject to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and from which afterwards <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was formed; as some indeed held. For this is quite impossible. First, because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh was not in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and in the other patriarchs, according to something signate, distinguishable from the rest of his flesh, as pure from impure; as already stated (6). Secondly, because since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh is infected by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, through being conceived in <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, just as the entire flesh of a man is conceived through <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, so also is it entirely defiled by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Consequently we must say that the entire flesh of the patriarchs was subjected to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, nor was there anything in them that was free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and from which afterwards <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body could be formed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not assume the flesh of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> subject to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but cleansed from all infection of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Thus it is that "no defiled thing cometh into the Wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is said to have assumed the first-fruits of our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as to the likeness of <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>; forasmuch as He assumed flesh not infected by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, like unto the flesh of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But this is not to be understood to imply a continuation of that primitive purity, as though the flesh of innocent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was preserved in its freedom from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> until the formation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Before Christ, there was actually in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> a wound, i.e. the infection of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. But the balm to heal the wound was not there actually, but only by a certain <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of origin, forasmuch as from those patriarchs the flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was to be propagated.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether Christ paid tithes in Abraham's loins?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> "paid <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>" in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> loins. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb007.htm#verse6">Hebrews 7:6-9</a>) that Levi, the great-grandson of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, "paid <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>," because, when the latter paid <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> to <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a>, "he was yet in his loins." In like manner <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> loins when the latter paid <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself also paid <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is of the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> according to the flesh which He received from His Mother. But His Mother paid <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. Therefore for a like reason did <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> was levied on that which needed healing," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. x). But all flesh subject to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> needed healing. Since therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh was the subject of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated above (<a href="#7">Article 7</a>), it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh paid <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, this does not seem to be at all derogatory to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> dignity. For the fact that the father of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> pays <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> does not hinder his son, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, from being of higher rank than an ordinary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Consequently, although we may say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> paid <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> when <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> paid them to <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a>, it does not follow that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not greater than <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. x) that "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> there," i.e. in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, "for His flesh derived from him, not the heat of the wound, but the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the antidote."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It behooves us to say that the sense of the passage quoted from the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> is that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> proves that the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> according to the order of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a> is greater than the Levitical <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, from the fact that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> paid <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> to <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a>, while Levi, from whom the legal <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> was derived, was yet in his loins. Now, if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had also paid <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, His <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> would not have been according to the order of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a>, but of a lower order. Consequently we must say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> loins, as Levi did.

<p>For since he who pays a <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> keeps nine parts to himself, and surrenders the tenth to another, inasmuch as the number ten is the sign of perfection, as being, in a sort, the terminus of all numbers which mount from one to ten, it follows that he who pays a <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> bears witness to his own imperfection and to the perfection of another. Now, to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is due the imperfection of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, which needs to be perfected by Him who cleanses from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But to heal from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> alone, for He is the "Lamb that taketh away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the world" (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse29">John 1:29</a>), whose figure was <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> proves (<a href="../bible/heb007.htm">Hebrews 7</a>). Therefore by giving <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> to <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a>, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> foreshadowed that he, as being conceived in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and all who were to be his descendants in contracting <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, needed that healing which is through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, and Levi, and all the others were in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> in such a way so as to be descended from him, not only as to bodily <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, but also as to seminal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, by which <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is transmitted. Consequently, they all paid <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, i.e. foreshadowed as needing to be healed by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> alone was in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> in such a manner as to descend from him, not by seminal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but according to bodily <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Therefore He was not in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> so as to need to be healed, but rather "as the balm with which the wound was to be healed." Therefore He did not pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> loins.

<p>Thus the answer to the first objection is made manifest.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Because the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> was conceived in <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, she was in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> as needing to be healed. Therefore she paid <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> in him, as descending from him according to seminal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But this is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh is said to have been subject to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according as it was in the patriarchs, by reason of the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> in which it was in His forefathers, who paid the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>: but not by reason of its <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> as actually in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who did not pay the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The levitical <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> was handed down through carnal origin: wherefore it was not less in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> than in Levi. Consequently, since <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> paid <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> to <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a> as to one greater than he, it follows that the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a>, inasmuch as he was a figure of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, was greater than that of Levi. But the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> does not result from carnal origin, but from <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore it is possible that a father pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, as the less to the greater, and yet his son, if he be a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, is greater than that <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, not through carnal origin, but through the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which he has received from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.
