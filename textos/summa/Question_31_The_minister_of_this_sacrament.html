<h1>Question 31. The minister of this sacrament</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5031.htm#article1"> Can a layman confer this sacrament?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5031.htm#article2"> Can a deacon?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5031.htm#article3"> Can none but a bishop confer it?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether a layman can confer this sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that even a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> can confer this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. For this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> derives its efficacy from <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, as James declares (<a href="../bible/jam005.htm#verse15">James 5:15</a>). But a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman's</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is sometimes as acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a>. Therefore he can confer this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, we read of certain fathers in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> that they sent the oil to the sick, and that these were healed. It is also related of the <a href="../cathen/06413f.htm">Blessed Genevieve</a> that she anointed the sick with oil. Therefore this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> can be conferred even by <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">lay people</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is given in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. But laymen have not the power to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore, etc.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Eccl. Hier. v) there are some who exercise <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchical</a> actions, and some who are recipients only. Hence laymen are officially incompetent to dispense any sacrament: and that they can <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> in cases of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, is due to the Divine dispensation, in order that no one may be deprived of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> regeneration.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is not said by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in his own <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, for since sometimes he is in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he would not in that case be heard. But it is said in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in whose <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> he can <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> as a public official, whereas a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> cannot, for he is a private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> These unctions were not sacramental. It was due to the devotion of the recipients of the unction, and to the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> of those who anointed them that they procured the effects of bodily health, through the "<a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of healing" (<a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse9">1 Corinthians 12:9</a>) but not through sacramental <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether deacons can confer this sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> can confer this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. For, according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Eccl. Hier. v) "<a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> have the power to cleanse." Now this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> was instituted precisely to cleanse from sickness of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> and body. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> also can confer it.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is a more excellent sacrament than the one of which we are speaking. But <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> can <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, as instanced by the Blessed Laurence. Therefore they can confer this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> also.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/jam005.htm#verse14">James 5:14</a>): "Let him bring in the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> has the power to cleanse but not to enlighten. Hence, since enlightenment is an effect of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, no sacrament whereby <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is conferred can be given by a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> in virtue of his office: and so he cannot confer this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, since <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is bestowed therein.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This sacrament cleanses by enlightening through the bestowal of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: wherefore a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> is not competent to confer it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This is not a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> sacrament, as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is. Hence its bestowal is not committed to all in cases of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, but only to those who are competent to do so in virtue of their office. Nor are <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> competent to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> in virtue of their office.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether none but a bishop can confer this sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that none but a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> can confer this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. For this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> consists in an anointing, just as Confirmation does. Now none but a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> can confirm. Therefore only a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> can confer this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, he who cannot do what is less cannot do what is greater. Now the use of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> surpasses the act of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, since the former is the end of the latter. Therefore since a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, neither can he use the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> after it has been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The minister of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> has to be brought in to the recipient, as is clear from <a href="../bible/jam005.htm#verse14">James 5:14</a>. Now a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> cannot go to all the sick people of his diocese. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is not the only one who can confer this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Eccl. Hier. v), the office of perfecting belongs to a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, just as it belongs to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to enlighten. Wherefore those <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are reserved to a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> dispensation, which place the recipient in a state of perfection above others. But this is not the case with this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, for it is given to all. Consequently it can be given by ordinary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Confirmation imprints a character, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is placed in a state of perfection, as stated above (III, 63, 1, 2,6). But this does not take place in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; hence there is no comparison.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although the use of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is of more importance than the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, from the point of view of the final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; nevertheless, from the point of view of efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is the more important, since the use of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is dependent thereon, as on its active <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: hence the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> demands a higher power than the use of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> does.
