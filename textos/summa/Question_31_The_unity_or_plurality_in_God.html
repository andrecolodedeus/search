<h1>Question 31. The unity or plurality in God</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1031.htm#article1"> The word "Trinity"</a> <li><a href="../summa/1031.htm#article2"> Can we say that the Son is other than the Father?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1031.htm#article3"> Can an exclusive term, which seems to exclude otherness, be joined to an essential name in God?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1031.htm#article4"> Can it be joined to a personal term?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether there is trinity in God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem there is not trinity in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For every name in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> signifies <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> or relation. But this name "<a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>" does not signify the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>; otherwise it would be predicated of each one of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>: nor does it signify relation; for it does not express a name that refers to another. Therefore the word "<a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>" is not to be applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, this word "trinity" is a collective term, since it signifies multitude. But such a word does not apply to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; as the unity of a collective name is the least of unities, whereas in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> the greatest possible unity. Therefore this word "trinity" does not apply to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every trine is threefold. But in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is not triplicity; since triplicity is a kind of inequality. Therefore neither is there trinity in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, all that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">God exists</a> in the unity of the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is His own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Therefore, if <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in the unity of the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; and thus in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there would be three <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> unities; which is <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, in all that is said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the concrete is predicated of the <a href="../cathen/01074a.htm">abstract</a>; for Deity is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and paternity is the Father. But the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> cannot be called trine; otherwise there would be nine realities in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; which, of course, is <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>. Therefore the word trinity is not to be applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> says: "Unity in <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>; and <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> in Unity is to be revered."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The name "<a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>" in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> signifies the determinate number of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. And so the plurality of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> requires that we should use the word trinity; because what is indeterminately signified by plurality, is signified by trinity in a determinate manner.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In its etymological sense, this word "<a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>" seems to signify the one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, according as trinity may mean trine-unity. But in the strict meaning of the term it rather signifies the number of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; and on this account we cannot say that the Father is the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, as He is not three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Yet it does not mean the relations themselves of the Persons, but rather the number of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> related to each other; and hence it is that the word in itself does not express regard to another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Two things are implied in a collective term, plurality of the "supposita," and a unity of some kind of order. For "people" is a multitude of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> comprehended under a certain order. In the first sense, this word "trinity" is like other collective words; but in the second sense it differs from them, because in the divine <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> not only is there unity of order, but also with this there is unity of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> "<a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>" is taken in an absolute sense; for it signifies the threefold number of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. "Triplicity" signifies a proportion of inequality; for it is a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of unequal proportion, according to <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> (Arithm. i, 23). Therefore in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is not triplicity, but <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> In the divine <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> is to be understood both number and the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> numbered. So when we say, "<a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> in Unity," we do not place number in the unity of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, as if we meant three times one; but we place the Persons numbered in the unity of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; as the "supposita" of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> are said to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. On the other hand, we say "Unity in <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>"; meaning that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is in its "supposita."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> When we say, "<a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> is trine," by reason of the number implied, we signify the multiplication of that number by itself; since the word trine imports a distinction in the "supposita" of which it is spoken. Therefore it cannot be said that the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> is trine; otherwise it follows that, if the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> be trine, there would be three "supposita" of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>; as when we say, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is trine," it follows that there are three "supposita" of the Godhead.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the Son is other than the Father?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is not other than the Father. For "other" is a relative term implying diversity of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. If, then, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is other than the Father, He must be different from the Father; which is contrary to what <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. vii), that when we speak of three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, "we do not mean to imply diversity."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whosoever are other from one another, differ in some way from one another. Therefore, if the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is other than the Father, it follows that He differs from the Father; which is against what <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Fide i), that "the Father and the Son are one in Godhead; nor is there any difference in <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> between them, nor any diversity."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the term alien is taken from "alius" [other]. But the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is not alien from the Father, for <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (De Trin. vii) that "in the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> there is nothing diverse, nothing alien, nothing separable." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is not other that the Father.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the terms "other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>" and "other thing" [alius et aliud] have the same meaning, differing only in gender. So if the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> from the Father, it follows that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is a thing apart from the Father.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [Fulgentius, De Fide ad Petrum i.] says: "There is one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the Father and Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, in which the Father is not one thing, the Son another, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> another; although the Father is one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, the Son another, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> another."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> remarks [In <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, Ep. lvii.], a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> arises from words wrongly used, when we speak of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> we must proceed with care and with befitting modesty; because, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. i, 3), "nowhere is <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> more harmful, the quest more toilsome, the finding more fruitful." Now, in treating of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, we must beware of two opposite <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, and proceed cautiously between them--namely, the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, who placed a <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> with the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of Sabellius, who placed unity of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> with the unity of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p>Thus, to avoid the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> we must shun the use of the terms diversity and difference in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, lest we take away the unity of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>: we may, however, use the term "distinction" on account of the relative opposition. Hence whenever we find terms of "diversity" or "difference" of Persons used in an authentic work, these terms of "diversity" or "difference" are taken to mean "distinction." But lest the simplicity and singleness of the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> be taken away, the terms "separation" and "division," which belong to the parts of a whole, are to be avoided: and lest <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> be taken away, we avoid the use of the term "disparity": and lest we remove similitude, we avoid the terms "alien" and "discrepant." For <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Fide i) that "in the Father and the Son there is no discrepancy, but one Godhead": and according to <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a>, as quoted above, "in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is nothing alien, nothing separable."

<p>To avoid the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Sabellius, we must shun the term "singularity," lest we take away the communicability of the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (De Trin. vii): "It is <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> to assert that the Father and the Son are separate in Godhead." We must avoid the adjective "only" [unici] lest we take away the number of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says in the same book: "We exclude from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of singularity or uniqueness." Nevertheless, we say "the only Son," for in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is no plurality of Sons. Yet, we do not say "the only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," for the Deity is common to several. We avoid the word "confused," lest we take away from the Persons the order of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Fide i): "What is one is not confused; and there is no multiplicity where there is no difference." The word "solitary" is also to be avoided, lest we take away the society of the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; for, as <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (De Trin. iv), "We confess neither a solitary nor a diverse <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p>This word "other" [alius], however, in the masculine sense, means only a distinction of "suppositum"; and hence we can properly say that "the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is other than the Father," because He is another "suppositum" of the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as He is another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and another hypostasis.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> "Other," being like the name of a particular thing, refers to the "suppositum"; and so, there is sufficient reason for using it, where there is a distinct <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> in the sense of hypostasis or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. But diversity requires a distinct <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> in the sense of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Thus we cannot say that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is diverse from the Father, although He is another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> "Difference" implies distinction of form. There is one form in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as appears from the text, "Who, when He was in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse6">Philippians 2:6</a>). Therefore the term "difference" does not properly apply to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as appears from the authority quoted. Yet, <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. i, 5) employs the term "difference" in the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, as meaning that the relative property is signified by way of form. Hence he says that the hypostases do not differ from each other in <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, but according to determinate properties. But "difference" is taken for "distinction," as above stated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The term "alien" means what is extraneous and dissimilar; which is not expressed by the term "other" [alius]; and therefore we say that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is "other" than the Father, but not that He is anything "alien."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The neuter gender is formless; whereas the masculine is formed and distinct; and so is the feminine. So the common <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is properly and aptly expressed by the neuter gender, but by the masculine and feminine is expressed the determined subject in the common <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence also in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, if we ask, Who is this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>? we answer, <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a>, which is the name of the "suppositum"; whereas, if we ask, What is he? we reply, A rational and mortal animal. So, because in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> distinction is by the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and not by the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, we say that the Father is other than the Son, but not something else; while conversely we say that they are one thing, but not one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the exclusive word "alone" should be added to the essential term in God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the exclusive word "alone" [solus] is not to be added to an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> term in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Elench. ii, 3), "He is alone who is not with another." But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. Therefore we cannot say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is alone.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever is joined to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> term in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can be predicated of every <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> "per se," and of all the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> together; for, as we can properly say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is wise, we can say the Father is a wise <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> is a wise <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. vi, 9): "We must consider the opinion that the Father is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be said to be alone.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further if this expression "alone" is joined to an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> term, it would be so joined as regards either the personal predicate or the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> predicate. But it cannot be the former, as it is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> to say, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is Father," since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> also is a father; nor, again, can it be applied as regards the latter, for, if this saying were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone creates," it would follow that the "Father alone creates," as whatever is said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can be said of the Father; and it would be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, as the Son also creates. Therefore this expression "alone" cannot be joined to an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> term in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said, "To the King of ages, <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, invisible, the only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse17">1 Timothy 1:17</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> This term "alone" can be taken as a categorematical term, or as a syncategorematical term. A categorematical term is one which ascribes absolutely its meaning to a given "suppositum"; as, for instance, "white" to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as when we say a "white <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." If the term "alone" is taken in this sense, it cannot in any way be joined to any term in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for it would mean solitude in the term to which it is joined; and it would follow that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was solitary, against what is above stated (2). A syncategorematical term imports the order of the predicate to the subject; as this expression "every one" or "no one"; and likewise the term "alone," as excluding every other "suppositum" from the predicate. Thus, when we say, "<a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> alone writes," we do not mean that <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> is solitary, but that he has no companion in writing, though many others may be with him. In this way nothing prevents the term "alone" being joined to any <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> term in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as excluding the predicate from all things but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; as if we said "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>," because nothing but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are always with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nevertheless, if plurality of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> did not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He would be alone or solitary. For solitude is not removed by association with anything that is extraneous in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; thus anyone is said to be alone in a garden, though many plants and animals are with him in the garden. Likewise, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would be alone or solitary, though <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and men were with Him, supposing that several <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> were not within Him. Therefore the society of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> does not take away absolute solitude from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; much less does it remove respective solitude, in reference to a predicate.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This expression "alone," properly speaking, does not affect the predicate, which is taken formally, for it refers to the "suppositum," as excluding any other suppositum from the one which it qualifies. But the adverb "only," being exclusive, can be applied either to subject or predicate. For we can say, "Only <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a>"--that is, no one else--"runs: and <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> runs only"--that is, he does nothing else. Hence it is not properly said that the Father is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, or the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, unless some implied meaning be assumed in the predicate, as, for instance, "The <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who alone is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." In that sense it can be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to say that the Father is that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who alone is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if the relative be referred to the predicate, and not to the "suppositum." So, when <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says that the Father is not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, but that the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, he speaks expositively, as he might explain the words, "To the King of ages, invisible, the only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," as applying not to the Father, but to the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> alone.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In both ways can the term "alone" be joined to an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> term. For this proposition, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is Father," can mean two things, because the word "Father" can signify the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Father; and then it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; for no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>: or it can signify that relation only; and thus it is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, because the relation of paternity is found also in others, though not in a univocal sense. Likewise it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to say <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone creates; nor, does it follow, "therefore the Father alone creates," because, as logicians say, an exclusive diction so fixes the term to which it is joined that what is said exclusively of that term cannot be said exclusively of an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> contained in that term: for instance, from the premiss, "Man alone is a mortal rational animal," we cannot conclude, "therefore <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> alone is such."

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether an exclusive diction can be joined to the personal term?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that an exclusive diction can be joined to the personal term, even though the predicate is common. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> speaking to the Father, said: "That they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Thee, the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse3">John 17:3</a>). Therefore the Father alone is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, He said: "No one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the Son but the Father" (<a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse27">Matthew 11:27</a>); which means that the Father alone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. But to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is common (to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>). Therefore the same conclusion follows.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, an exclusive diction does not exclude what enters into the concept of the term to which it is joined. Hence it does not exclude the part, nor the universal; for it does not follow that if we say "<a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> alone is white," that therefore "his hand is not white," or that "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not white." But one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is in the concept of another; as the Father is in the concept of the Son; and conversely. Therefore, when we say, The Father alone is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we do not exclude the Son, nor the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; so that such a mode of speaking is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> sings: "Thou alone art Most High, O <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> This proposition "The Father alone is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" includes two assertions--namely, that the Father is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that no other besides the Father is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But this second proposition is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is another from the Father, and He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, The Father alone is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and the same of the like sayings.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> When we say, "The Father alone is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," such a proposition can be taken in several senses. If "alone" means solitude in the Father, it is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> in a categorematical sense; but if taken in a syncategorematical sense it can again be understood in several ways. For if it exclude (all others) from the form of the subject, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, the sense being "the Father alone is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>"--that is, "He who with no other is the Father, is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." In this way <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> expounds when he says (De Trin. vi, 6): "We say the Father alone, not because He is separate from the Son, or from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, but because they are not the Father together with Him." This, however, is not the usual way of speaking, unless we understand another implication, as though we said "He who alone is called the Father is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." But in the strict sense the exclusion affects the predicate. And thus the proposition is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> if it excludes another in the masculine sense; but <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> if it excludes it in the neuter sense; because the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> than the Father, but not another thing; and the same applies to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. But because this diction "alone," properly speaking, refers to the subject, it tends to exclude another Person rather than other things. Hence such a way of speaking is not to be taken too literally, but it should be piously expounded, whenever we find it in an authentic work.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> When we say, "Thee the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," we do not understand it as referring to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Father, but to the whole <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> expounds (De Trin. vi, 9). Or, if understood of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Father, the other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are not excluded by reason of the unity of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; in so far as the word "only" excludes another thing, as above explained.

<p><strong>The same Reply can be given to Objection 2.</strong> For an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> term applied to the Father does not exclude the Son or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, by reason of the unity of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Hence we must understand that in the text quoted the term "no one" [Nemo = non-homo, i.e. no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>] is not the same as "no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," which the word itself would seem to signify (for the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Father could not be excepted), but is taken according to the usual way of speaking in a distributive sense, to mean any rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The exclusive diction does not exclude what enters into the concept of the term to which it is adjoined, if they do not differ in "suppositum," as part and universal. But the Son differs in "suppositum" from the Father; and so there is no parity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> We do not say absolutely that the Son alone is Most High; but that He alone is Most High "with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father."
