<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether almsgiving is an act of charity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that almsgiving is not an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> one cannot do acts of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Now it is possible to give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> without having <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse3">1 Corinthians 13:3</a>: "If I should distribute all my goods to feed the poor . . . and have not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, it profiteth me nothing." Therefore almsgiving is not an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, almsdeeds are reckoned among works of satisfaction, according to <a href="../bible/dan004.htm#verse24">Daniel 4:24</a>: "Redeem thou thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> with <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>." Now satisfaction is an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Therefore almsgiving is an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and not of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the offering of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is an act of religion.

<p>But almsgiving is offering a sacrifice to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse16">Hebrews 13:16</a>: "Do not forget to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and to impart, for by such <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> favor is obtained." Therefore almsgiving is not an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, but of religion.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, l) that to give for a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> purpose is an act of liberality. Now this is especially <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsgiving</a>. Therefore almsgiving is not an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written <a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse17">1 John 3:17</a>: "He that hath the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">substance</a> of this world, and shall see his brother in need, and shall put up his bowels from him, how doth the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> abide in him?"

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> External acts belong to that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which regards the motive for doing those acts. Now the motive for giving <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> is to relieve one who is in need. Wherefore some have defined <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> as being "a <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> whereby something is given to the needy, out of compassion and for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake," which motive belongs to mercy, as stated above (30, 1,2). Hence it is clear that almsgiving is, properly speaking, an act of mercy. This appears in its very name, for in Greek <em>eleemosyne</em> it is derived from having mercy <em>eleein</em> even as the <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> "miseratio" is. And since mercy is an effect of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as shown above (30, 2, 3, Objection 3), it follows that almsgiving is an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> through the medium of mercy.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> An act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> may be taken in two ways: first materially, thus an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is to do what is just; and such an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> can be without the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since many, without having the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, do what is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, led by the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> light of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, or through fear, or in the hope of gain. Secondly, we speak of a thing being an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> formally, and thus an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is to do what is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, in the same way as a just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, i.e. with readiness and delight, and such an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> cannot be without the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p>Accordingly almsgiving can be materially without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, but to give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> formally, i.e. for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake, with delight and readiness, and altogether as one ought, is not possible without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Nothing hinders the proper elicited act of one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> being commanded by another <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> as commanding it and directing it to this other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue's</a> end. It is in this way that almsgiving is reckoned among works of satisfaction in so far as pity for the one in distress is directed to the satisfaction for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and in so far as it is directed to placate <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it has the character of a sacrifice, and thus it is commanded by religion.

<p>Wherefore the Reply to the Third Objection is evident.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Almsgiving belongs to liberality, in so far as liberality removes an obstacle to that act, which might arise from excessive love of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, the result of which is that one clings to them more than one ought.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the different kinds of almsdeeds are suitably enumerated?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the different kinds of almsdeeds are unsuitably enumerated. For we reckon seven corporal <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsdeeds</a>, namely, to feed the hungry, to give drink to the thirsty, to clothe the naked, to harbor the harborless, to visit the sick, to ransom the captive, to bury the dead; all of which are expressed in the following verse: "To visit, to quench, to feed, to ransom, clothe, harbor or bury."

<p>Again we reckon seven <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, namely, to instruct the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, to counsel the <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>, to comfort the sorrowful, to reprove the sinner, to forgive injuries, to bear with those who trouble and annoy us, and to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for all, which are all contained in the following verse: "To counsel, reprove, console, to pardon, forbear, and to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>," yet so that counsel includes both advice and instruction.

<p>And it seems that these various almsdeeds are unsuitably enumerated. For the purpose of almsdeeds is to succor our neighbor. But a dead <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> profits nothing by being buried, else <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> would not have spoken <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> when He said (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse28">Matthew 10:28</a>): "Be not afraid of them who kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do." [The quotation is from <a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse4">Luke 12:4</a>.] This explains why <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>, in enumerating the <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">works of mercy</a>, made no mention of the burial of the dead (<a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse35">Matthew 25:35-36</a>). Therefore it seems that these almsdeeds are unsuitably enumerated.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), the purpose of giving <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> is to relieve our neighbor's need. Now there are many needs of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life other than those mentioned above, for instance, a blind <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs a leader, a lame <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs someone to lean on, a poor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>. Therefore these almsdeeds are unsuitably enumerated.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, almsgiving is a work of mercy. But the reproof of the wrong-doer savors, apparently, of severity rather than of mercy. Therefore it ought not to be reckoned among the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsdeeds</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, almsgiving is intended for the supply of a defect. But no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is without the defect of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> in some <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> or other. Therefore, apparently, each one ought to instruct anyone who is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> himself.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Nom. in Evang. ix): "Let him that hath understanding beware lest he withhold his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; let him that hath abundance of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, watch lest he slacken his merciful bounty; let him who is a servant to art be most solicitous to share his skill and profit with his neighbor; let him who has an opportunity of speaking with the wealthy, fear lest he be condemned for retaining his talent, if when he has the chance he plead not with him the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the poor." Therefore the aforesaid almsdeeds are suitably enumerated in respect of those things whereof men have abundance or insufficiency.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The aforesaid distinction of almsdeeds is suitably taken from the various needs of our neighbor: some of which affect the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and are relieved by <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsdeeds</a>, while others affect the body, and are relieved by corporal <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsdeeds</a>. For corporal need occurs either during this life or afterwards. If it occurs during this life, it is either a common need in respect of things needed by all, or it is a special need occurring through some <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> supervening. On the first case, the need is either internal or external. Internal need is twofold: one which is relieved by solid food, viz. hunger, in respect of which we have "to feed the hungry"; while the other is relieved by liquid food, viz. thirst, and in respect of this we have "to give drink to the thirsty." The common need with regard to external help is twofold; one in respect of clothing, and as to this we have "to clothe the naked": while the other is in respect of a dwelling place, and as to this we have "to harbor the harborless." Again if the need be special, it is either the result of an internal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, like sickness, and then we have "to visit the sick," or it results from an external <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and then we have "to ransom the captive." After this life we give "burial to the dead."

<p>In like manner <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> needs are relieved by <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> acts in two ways, first by asking for help from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in this respect we have "<a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>," whereby one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for others; secondly, by giving <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> assistance, and this in three ways. First, in order to relieve a deficiency on the part of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and if this deficiency be in the speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, the remedy is applied by "instructing," and if in the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, the remedy is applied by "counselling." Secondly, there may be a deficiency on the part of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, especially by way of sorrow, which is remedied by "comforting." Thirdly, the deficiency may be due to an inordinate act; and this may be the subject of a threefold consideration. First, in respect of the sinner, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> proceeds from his inordinate will, and thus the remedy takes the form of "reproof." Secondly, in respect of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against; and if the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be committed against ourselves, we apply the remedy by "pardoning the injury," while, if it be committed against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or our neighbor, it is not in our power to pardon, as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> observes (Super Matth. xviii, 15). Thirdly, in respect of the result of the inordinate act, on account of which the sinner is an annoyance to those who live with him, even beside his <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>; in which case the remedy is applied by "bearing with him," especially with regard to those who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> out of weakness, according to <a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse1">Romans 15:1</a>: "We that are stronger, ought to bear the infirmities of the weak," and not only as regards their being infirm and consequently troublesome on account of their unruly actions, but also by bearing any other burdens of theirs with them, according to <a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse2">Galatians 6:2</a>: "Bear ye one another's burdens."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Burial does not profit a dead <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as though his body could be capable of perception after death. On this sense <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said that those who kill the body "have no more that they can do"; and for this reason He did not mention the burial of the dead with the other <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">works of mercy</a>, but those only which are more clearly <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Nevertheless it does concern the deceased what is done with his body: both that he may live in the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whose respect he forfeits if he remain without burial, and as regards a man's fondness for his own body while he was yet living, a fondness which kindly <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> should imitate after his death. It is thus that some are praised for burying the dead, as <a href="../cathen/14749c.htm">Tobias</a>, and those who buried <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>; as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Cura pro Mort. iii).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> All other needs are reduced to these, for blindness and lameness are kinds of sickness, so that to lead the blind, and to support the lame, come to the same as visiting the sick. On like manner to assist a man against any distress that is due to an extrinsic <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> comes to the same as the ransom of captives. And the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> with which we relieve the poor is sought merely for the purpose of relieving the aforesaid needs: hence there was no reason for special mention of this particular need.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The reproof of the sinner, as to the exercise of the act of reproving, seems to imply the severity of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but, as to the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the reprover, who wishes to free a man from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it is an act of mercy and lovingkindness, according to <a href="../bible/pro027.htm#verse6">Proverbs 27:6</a>: "Better are the wounds of a friend, than the deceitful kisses of an enemy."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Nescience is not always a defect, but only when it is about what one ought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and it is a part of almsgiving to supply this defect by instruction. On doing this however we should observe the due circumstances of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, place and time, even as in other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> acts.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether corporal alms are of more account than spiritual alms?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that corporal <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> are of more account than <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. For it is more praiseworthy to give an <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> to one who is in greater want, since an almsdeed is to be praised because it relieves one who is in need. Now the body which is relieved by corporal <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, is by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> more needy than the spirit which is relieved by <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. Therefore corporal <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> are of more account.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, an <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> is less praiseworthy and <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> if the kindness is compensated, wherefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> says (<a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse12">Luke 14:12</a>): "When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy neighbors who are rich, lest perhaps they also invite thee again. Now there is always compensation in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsdeeds</a>, since he who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for another, profits thereby, according to <a href="../bible/psa034.htm#verse13">Psalm 34:13</a>: "My <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> shall be turned into my bosom: and he who teaches another, makes progress in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which cannot be said of corporal <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsdeeds</a>. Therefore corporal almsdeeds are of more account than <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsdeeds</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, an <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> is to be commended if the needy one is comforted by it: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/job031.htm#verse20">Job 31:20</a>): "If his sides have not blessed me," and the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says to Philemon (<a href="../bible/phm001.htm#verse7">verse 7</a>): "The bowels of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> have been refreshed by thee, brother." Now a corporal <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> is sometimes more welcome to a needy <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> than a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. Therefore bodily almsdeeds are of more account than <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsdeeds</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 20) on the words, "Give to him that asketh of thee" (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse42">Matthew 5:42</a>): "You should give so as to injure neither yourself nor another, and when you refuse what another asks you must not lose sight of the claims of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and send him away empty; at times indeed you will give what is better than what is asked for, if you reprove him that asks <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>." Now reproof is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> almsdeeds are preferable to corporal <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsdeeds</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There are two ways of comparing these almsdeeds. First, simply; and in this respect, <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> almsdeeds hold the first place, for three reasons. First, because the offering is more excellent, since it is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, which surpasses a corporal <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, according to <a href="../bible/pro004.htm#verse2">Proverbs 4:2</a>: "I will give you a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, forsake not My Law." Secondly, on account of the object succored, because the spirit is more excellent than the body, wherefore, even as a man in looking after himself, ought to look to his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> more than to his body, so ought he in looking after his neighbor, whom he ought to love as himself. Thirdly, as regards the acts themselves by which our neighbor is succored, because <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> acts are more excellent than corporal acts, which are, in a fashion, servile.

<p>Secondly, we may compare them with regard to some particular case, when some corporal <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> excels some <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>: for instance, a man in hunger is to be fed rather than instructed, and as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> observes (Topic. iii, 2), for a needy <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> "money is better than <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>," although the latter is better simply.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is better to give to one who is in greater want, other things being equal, but if he who is less needy is better, and is in want of better things, it is better to give to him: and it is thus in the case in point.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Compensation does not detract from <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> and praise if it be not intended, even as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, if not intended, does not detract from <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Thus Sallust says of Cato (Catilin.), that "the less he sought fame, the more he became famous": and thus it is with <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsdeeds</a>.

<p>Nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of gaining <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods does not detract from <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of gaining corporal goods.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of an almsgiver depends on that in which the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the recipient rests reasonably, and not on that in which it rests when it is inordinate.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether corporal almsdeeds have a spiritual effect?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that corporal almsdeeds have not a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> effect. For no effect exceeds its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods exceed corporal goods. Therefore corporal almsdeeds have no <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> effect.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of simony consists in giving the corporal for the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, and it is to be utterly avoided. Therefore one ought not to give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> in order to receive a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> effect.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to multiply the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is to multiply the effect. If therefore corporal almsdeeds <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> effect, the greater the <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, the greater the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> profit, which is contrary to what we read (<a href="../bible/luk021.htm#verse3">Luke 21:3</a>) of the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> who cast two brass mites into the treasury, and in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> own words "cast in more than . . . all." Therefore bodily almsdeeds have no <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> effect.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/sir017.htm#verse18">Sirach 17:18</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> of a man . . . shall preserve the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of a man as the apple of the eye."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Corporal almsdeeds may be considered in three ways. First, with regard to their <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, and in this way they have merely a corporal effect, inasmuch as they supply our neighbor's corporal needs. Secondly, they may be considered with regard to their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, in so far as a man gives a corporal <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> out of love for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and his neighbor, and in this respect they bring forth a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> fruit, according to <a href="../bible/sir029.htm#verse13">Sirach 29:13-14</a>: "Lose thy money for thy brother . . . place thy treasure in the commandments of the Most High, and it shall bring thee more profit than gold."

<p>Thirdly, with regard to the effect, and in this way again, they have a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> fruit, inasmuch as our neighbor, who is succored by a corporal <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, is moved to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for his benefactor; wherefore the above text goes on (<a href="../bible/sir029.htm#verse15">Sirach 29:15</a>): "Shut up <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> in the heart of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and it shall obtain help for thee from all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument considers corporal almsdeeds as to their <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> He who gives an <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> does rot intend to buy a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> thing with a corporal thing, for he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> surpass corporal things, but he intends to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> fruit through the love of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> who gave less in <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, gave more in proportion; and thus we gather that the fervor of her <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, whence corporal almsdeeds derive their <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> efficacy, was greater.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether almsgiving is a matter of precept?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that almsgiving is not a matter of precept. For the counsels are distinct from the precepts. Now almsgiving is a matter of counsel, according to <a href="../bible/dan004.htm#verse24">Daniel 4:24</a>: "Let my counsel be acceptable to the King; [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'to thee, and'] redeem thou thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> with <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>." Therefore almsgiving is not a matter of precept.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is lawful for everyone to use and to keep what is his own. Yet by keeping it he will not give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. Therefore it is lawful not to give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>: and consequently almsgiving is not a matter of precept.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whatever is a matter of precept binds the transgressor at some time or other under pain of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because positive precepts are binding for some fixed time. Therefore, if almsgiving were a matter of precept, it would be possible to point to some fixed time when a man would commit a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> unless he gave an <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. But it does not appear how this can be so, because it can always be deemed probable that the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in need can be relieved in some other way, and that what we would spend in almsgiving might be needful to ourselves either now or in some future time. Therefore it seems that almsgiving is not a matter of precept.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, every commandment is reducible to the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">Decalogue</a>. But these precepts contain no reference to <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsgiving</a>. Therefore almsgiving is not a matter of precept.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is punished <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> for omitting to do what is not a matter of precept. But some are punished <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> for omitting to give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, as is clear from <a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse41">Matthew 25:41-43</a>. Therefore almsgiving is a matter of precept.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As love of our neighbor is a matter of precept, whatever is a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> to the love of our neighbor is a matter of precept also. Now the love of our neighbor requires that not only should we be our neighbor's well-wishers, but also his well-doers, according to <a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse18">1 John 3:18</a>: "Let us not love in word, nor in tongue, but in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." And in order to be a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> well-wisher and well-doer, we ought to succor his needs: this is done by <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsgiving</a>. Therefore almsgiving is a matter of precept.

<p>Since, however, precepts are about acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, it follows that all almsgiving must be a matter of precept, in so far as it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, namely, in so far as it is demanded by right reason. Now right reason demands that we should take into consideration something on the part of the giver, and something on the part of the recipient. On the part of the giver, it must be noted that he should give of his surplus, according to <a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse41">Luke 11:41</a>: "That which remaineth, give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>." This surplus is to be taken in reference not only to himself, so as to denote what is unnecessary to the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, but also in reference to those of whom he has charge (in which case we have the expression "<a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>" [The official necessities of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in position] taking the word "person" as expressive of dignity). Because each one must first of all look after himself and then after those over whom he has charge, and afterwards with what remains relieve the needs of others. Thus <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> first, by its nutritive power, takes what it requires for the upkeep of one's own body, and afterwards yields the residue for the formation of another by the power of generation.

<p>On the part of the recipient it is requisite that he should be in need, else there would be no reason for giving him <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>: yet since it is not possible for one <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> to relieve the needs of all, we are not bound to relieve all who are in need, but only those who could not be succored if we not did succor them. For in such cases the words of <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> apply, "Feed him that dies of hunger: if thou hast not fed him, thou hast slain him" [Cf. Canon Pasce, dist. lxxxvi, whence the words, as quoted, are taken]. Accordingly we are bound to give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> of our surplus, as also to give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> to one whose need is extreme: otherwise <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsgiving</a>, like any other greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, is a matter of counsel.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">Daniel</a> spoke to a king who was not subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> Law, wherefore such things as were prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> which he did not profess, had to be counselled to him. Or he may have been speaking in reference to a case in which almsgiving was not a matter of precept.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The temporal goods which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> grants us, are ours as to the ownership, but as to the use of them, they belong not to us alone but also to such others as we are able to succor out of what we have over and above our needs. Hence <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a> says [Hom. super Luc. xii, 18: "If you acknowledge them," viz. your temporal goods, "as coming from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is He <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> because He apportions them unequally? Why are you rich while another is poor, unless it be that you may have the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> stewardship, and he the reward of patience? It is the hungry <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> bread that you withhold, the naked <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> cloak that you have stored away, the shoe of the barefoot that you have left to rot, the money of the needy that you have buried underground: and so you injure as many as you might help." <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> expresses himself in the same way.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There is a time when we <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> mortally if we omit to give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>; on the part of the recipient when we see that his need is evident and urgent, and that he is not likely to be succored otherwise--on the part of the giver, when he has superfluous goods, which he does not need for the time being, as far as he can judge with probability. Nor need he consider every case that may possibly occur in the future, for this would be to think about the morrow, which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> forbade us to do (<a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse34">Matthew 6:34</a>), but he should judge what is superfluous and what <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, according as things probably and generally occur.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> All succor given to our neighbor is reduced to the precept about honoring our parents. For thus does the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> interpret it (<a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse8">1 Timothy 4:8</a>) where he says: "Dutifulness* [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: '<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">Godliness</a>'] is profitable to all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come," and he says this because the precept about honoring our parents contains the promise, "that thou mayest be longlived upon the land" (<a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse12">Exodus 20:12</a>): and dutifulness comprises all kinds of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsgiving</a>. ["Pietas," whence our English word "Piety." Cf. also inf, 101, 2.]

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether one ought to give alms out of what one needs?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one ought not to give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> out of what one needs. For the order of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> should be observed not only as regards the effect of our benefactions but also as regards our interior affections. Now it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to contravene the order of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, because this order is a matter of precept. Since, then, the order of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> requires that a man should love himself more than his neighbor, it seems that he would <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> if he deprived himself of what he needed, in order to succor his neighbor.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whoever gives away what he needs himself, squanders his own <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, and that is to be a prodigal, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iv, 1). But no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> should be done. Therefore we should not give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> out of what we need.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse8">1 Timothy 5:8</a>): "If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> have not care of his own, and especially of those of his house, he hath denied the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and is worse than an infidel." Now if a man gives of what he needs for himself or for his charge, he seems to detract from the care he should have for himself or his charge. Therefore it seems that whoever gives <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> from what he needs, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> gravely.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse21">Matthew 19:21</a>): "If thou wilt be perfect, go, sell what thou hast, and give to the poor." Now he that gives all he has to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, gives not only what he needs not, but also what he needs. Therefore a man may give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> out of what he needs.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in two ways: first, because without it something is impossible, and it is altogether wrong to give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> out of what is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to us in this sense; for instance, if a man found himself in the presence of a case of urgency, and had merely sufficient to support himself and his children, or others under his charge, he would be throwing away his life and that of others if he were to give away in <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, what was then <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to him. Yet I say this without prejudice to such a case as might happen, supposing that by depriving himself of necessaries a man might help a great personage, and a support of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> or State, since it would be a praiseworthy act to endanger one's life and the lives of those who are under our charge for the delivery of such a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, since the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is to be preferred to one's own.

<p>Secondly, a thing is said to be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, if a man cannot without it live in keeping with his social station, as regards either himself or those of whom he has charge. The "<a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>" considered thus is not an invariable <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, for one might add much more to a man's property, and yet not go beyond what he needs in this way, or one might take much from him, and he would still have sufficient for the decencies of life in keeping with his own position. Accordingly it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> of this kind of "<a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>"; and it is a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> not of precept but of counsel. Yet it would be inordinate to deprive oneself of one's own, in order to give to others to such an extent that the residue would be insufficient for one to live in keeping with one's station and the ordinary occurrences of life: for no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ought to live unbecomingly. There are, however, three exceptions to the above rule. The first is when a man changes his state of life, for instance, by entering religion, for then he gives away all his possessions for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake, and does the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> of perfection by transferring himself to another state. Secondly, when that which he deprives himself of, though it be required for the decencies of life, can nevertheless easily be recovered, so that he does not suffer extreme inconvenience. Thirdly, when he is in presence of extreme indigence in an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, or great need on the part of the common weal. For in such cases it would seem praiseworthy to forego the requirements of one's station, in order to provide for a greater need.

<p>The objections may be easily solved from what has been said.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether one may give alms out of ill-gotten goods?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one may give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> out of ill-gotten goods. For it is written (<a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse9">Luke 16:9</a>): "Make unto you friends of the <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a> signifies <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>. Therefore it is lawful to make unto oneself <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> friends by giving <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> out of ill-gotten <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, all filthy lucre seems to be ill-gotten. But the profits from whoredom are filthy lucre; wherefore it was forbidden (<a href="../bible/deu023.htm#verse18">Deuteronomy 23:18</a>) to offer therefrom <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> or oblations to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: "Thou shalt not offer the hire of a strumpet . . . in the house of . . . thy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." On like manner gains from games of chance are ill-gotten, for, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 1), "we take such like gains from our friends to whom we ought rather to give." And most of all are the profits from simony ill-gotten, since thereby the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is wronged. Nevertheless out of such gains it is lawful to give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. Therefore one may give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> out of ill-gotten goods.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, greater <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> should be avoided more than lesser <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. Now it is less <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> to keep back another's property than to commit <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, of which a man is guilty if he fails to succor one who is in extreme need, as appears from the words of <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> who says (Cf. Canon Pasce dist. lxxxvi, whence the words, as quoted, are taken): "Feed him that dies of hunger, if thou hast not fed him, thou hast slain him". Therefore, in certain cases, it is lawful to give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> of ill-gotten goods.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Verb. Dom. xxxv, 2): "Give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> from your just labors. For you will not bribe Christ your judge, not to hear you with the poor whom you rob . . . Give not <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> from interest and usury: I speak to the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to whom we dispense the Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing may be ill-gotten in three ways. On the first place a thing is ill-gotten if it be due to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> from whom it is gotten, and may not be kept by the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who has obtained possession of it; as in the case of rapine, <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> and usury, and of such things a man may not give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> since he is bound to restore them.

<p>Secondly, a thing is ill-gotten, when he that has it may not keep it, and yet he may not return it to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> from whom he received it, because he received it <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>, while the latter gave it <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>. This happens in simony, wherein both giver and receiver contravene the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of the Divine Law, so that restitution is to be made not to the giver, but by giving <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. The same applies to all similar cases of illegal giving and receiving.

<p>Thirdly, a thing is ill-gotten, not because the taking was unlawful, but because it is the outcome of something unlawful, as in the case of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> profits from whoredom. This is filthy lucre properly so called, because the practice of whoredom is filthy and against the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> does not act <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> or unlawfully in taking the money. Consequently it is lawful to keep and to give in <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> what is thus acquired by an unlawful action.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Verb. Dom. 2), "Some have misunderstood this saying of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>, so as to take another's property and give thereof to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, thinking that they are fulfilling the commandment by so doing. This interpretation must be amended. Yet all <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> are called <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, as stated in De Quaest. Ev. ii, 34, because "<a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> are not <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> save for those who are themselves <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, and put all their trust in them. Or, according to <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> in his commentary on <a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse9">Luke 16:9</a>, "Make unto yourselves friends," etc., "He calls <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a> <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, because it draws our affections by the various allurements of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>." Or, because "among the many ancestors whose property you inherit, there is one who took the property of others <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>, although you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing about it," as <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a> says in a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> (Hom. super Luc. A, 5). Or, all <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> are styled <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> "of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>," i.e., of "inequality," because they are not distributed equally among all, one being in need, and another in affluence.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> We have already explained how <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> may be given out of the profits of whoredom. Yet <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and oblations were not made therefrom at the altar, both on account of the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, and through reverence for sacred things. It is also lawful to give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> out of the profits of simony, because they are not due to him who paid, indeed he deserves to lose them. But as to the profits from games of chance, there would seem to be something unlawful as being contrary to the Divine Law, when a man wins from one who cannot alienate his property, such as minors, lunatics and so forth, or when a man, with the desire of making money out of another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, entices him to play, and wins from him by cheating. On these cases he is bound to restitution, and consequently cannot give away his gains in <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. Then again there would seem to be something unlawful as being against the positive <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>, which altogether forbids any such profits. Since, however, a <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> does not bind all, but only those who are subject to that <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and moreover may be abrogated through desuetude, it follows that all such as are bound by these laws are bound to make restitution of such gains, unless perchance the contrary custom prevail, or unless a man win from one who enticed him to play, in which case he is not bound to restitution, because the loser does not deserve to be paid back: and yet he cannot lawfully keep what he has won, so long as that positive <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is in force, wherefore in this case he ought to give it away in <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> All things are common property in a case of extreme <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. Hence one who is in such dire straits may take another's goods in order to succor himself, if he can find no one who is willing to give him something. For the same reason a man may retain what belongs to another, and give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> thereof; or even take something if there be no other way of succoring the one who is in need. If however this be possible without danger, he must ask the owner's consent, and then succor the poor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who is in extreme <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether one who is under another's power can give alms?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one who is under another's power can give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. For religious are under the power of their <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> to whom they have vowed obedience. Now if it were unlawful for them to give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, they would lose by entering the state of religion, for as <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> [The quotation is from the works of Ambrosiaster. Cf. Ondex to ecclesiastical authorities quoted by <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>] says on <a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse8">1 Timothy 4:8</a>: "'Dutifulness [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: '<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">godliness</a>'] is profitable to all things': The sum total of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> consists in doing one's <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> by all," and the most creditable way of doing this is to give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. Therefore those who are in another's power can give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a wife is under her husband's power (<a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse16">Genesis 3:16</a>). But a wife can give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> since she is her husband's partner; hence it is related of the <a href="../cathen/09414a.htm">Blessed Lucy</a> that she gave <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> without the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of her <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> ["Sponsus" The matrimonial institutions of the Romans were so entirely different from ours that "sponsus" is no longer accurately rendered either "husband" or "<a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a>."] Therefore a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is not prevented from giving <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, by being under another's power.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the subjection of children to their parents is founded on <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse1">Ephesians 6:1</a>): "Children, obey your parents in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>." But, apparently, children may give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> out of their parents' property. For it is their own, since they are the heirs; wherefore, since they can employ it for some bodily use, it seems that much more can they use it in giving <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> so as to profit their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Therefore those who are under another's power can give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, servants are under their master's power, according to <a href="../bible/tit002.htm#verse9">Titus 2:9</a>: "Exhort servants to be obedient to their masters." Now they may lawfully do anything that will profit their masters: and this would be especially the case if they gave <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> for them. Therefore those who are under another's power can give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">Alms</a> should not be given out of another's property; and each one should give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> out of the just profit of his own labor as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Verb. Dom. xxxv, 2). Now if those who are subject to anyone were to give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, this would be out of another's property. Therefore those who are under another's power cannot give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Anyone who is under another's power must, as such, be ruled in accordance with the power of his superior: for the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order demands that the inferior should be ruled according to its superior. Therefore in those matters in which the inferior is subject to his superior, his ministrations must be subject to the superior's permission.

<p>Accordingly he that is under another's power must not give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> of anything in respect of which he is subject to that other, except in so far as he has been commissioned by his superior. But if he has something in respect of which he is not under the power of his superior, he is no longer subject to another in its regard, being independent in respect of that particular thing, and he can give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> therefrom.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> If a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> be dispensed through being commissioned by his superior, he can give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> from the property of his monaster, in accordance with the terms of his commission; but if he has no such dispensation, since he has nothing of his own, he cannot give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> without his abbot's permission either express or presumed for some probable reason: except in a case of extreme <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, when it would be lawful for him to commit a <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> in order to give an <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. Nor does it follow that he is worse off than before, because, as stated in De Eccles. Dogm. lxxi, "it is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thing to give one's property to the poor little by little, but it is better still to give all at once in order to follow <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and being freed from care, to be needy with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A wife, who has other property besides her <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a> which is for the support of the burdens of marriage, whether that property be gained by her own industry or by any other lawful means, can give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, out of that property, without asking her husband's permission: yet such <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> should be moderate, lest through giving too much she impoverish her husband. Otherwise she ought not to give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> without the express or presumed consent of her husband, except in cases of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> as stated, in the case of a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, in the preceding Reply. For though the wife be her husband's equal in the marriage act, yet in matters of housekeeping, the head of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse3">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>). As regards <a href="../cathen/09414a.htm">Blessed Lucy</a>, she had a <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a>, not a husband, wherefore she could give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> with her mother's consent.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> What belongs to the children belongs also to the father: wherefore the child cannot give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, except in such small <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> that one may presume the father to be willing: unless, perchance, the father authorize his child to dispose of any particular property. The same applies to servants.

<p>Hence the Reply to the Fourth Objection is clear.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether one ought to give alms to those rather who are more closely united to us?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one ought not to give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> to those rather who are more closely united to us. For it is written (<a href="../bible/sir012.htm#verse4">Sirach 12:4-6</a>): "Give to the merciful and uphold not the sinner . . . Do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and give not to the ungodly." Now it happens sometimes that those who are closely united to us are <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> and ungodly. Therefore we ought not to give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> to them in preference to others.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> should be given that we may receive an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> reward in return, according to <a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse18">Matthew 6:18</a>: "And thy Father Who seeth in secret, will repay thee." Now the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> reward is gained chiefly by the <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> which are given to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, according to <a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse9">Luke 16:9</a>: "Make unto you friends of the <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, that when you shall fail, they may receive you into everlasting dwellings, which passage <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> expounds (De Verb. Dom. xxxv, 1): "Who shall have everlasting dwellings unless the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>? And who are they that shall be received by them into their dwellings, if not those who succor them in their needs? Therefore <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> should be given to the more <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> rather than to those who are more closely united to us.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is more closely united to himself. But a man cannot give himself an <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. Therefore it seems that we are not bound to give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> to those who are most closely united to us.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse8">1 Timothy 5:8</a>): "If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> have not care of his own, and especially of those of his house, he hath denied the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and is worse than an infidel."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 28), "it falls to us by lot, as it were, to have to look to the welfare of those who are more closely united to us." Nevertheless in this matter we must employ discretion, according to the various degrees of connection, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and utility. For we ought to give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> to one who is much <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holier</a> and in greater want, and to one who is more useful to the common weal, rather than to one who is more closely united to us, especially if the latter be not very closely united, and has no special claim on our care then and there, and who is not in very urgent need.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> We ought not to help a sinner as such, that is by encouraging him to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that is by supporting his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Almsdeeds deserve on two counts to receive an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> reward. First because they are rooted in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and in this respect an almsdeed is <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> in so far as it observes the order of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which requires that, other things being equal, we should, in preference, help those who are more closely connected with us. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Officiis i, 30): "It is with commendable liberality that you forget not your kindred, if you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them to be in need, for it is better that you should yourself help your own <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, who would be ashamed to beg help from others." Secondly, almsdeeds deserve to be rewarded <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>, through the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of the recipient, who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for the giver, and it is in this sense that <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is speaking.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Since almsdeeds are <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">works of mercy</a>, just as a man does not, properly speaking, pity himself, but only by a kind of comparison, as stated above (30, 1,2), so too, properly speaking, no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> gives himself an <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, unless he act in another's <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; thus when a man is appointed to distribute <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, he can take something for himself, if he be in want, on the same ground as when he gives to others.

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether alms should be given in abundance?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> should not be given in abundance. For we ought to give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> to those chiefly who are most closely connected with us. But we ought not to give to them in such a way that they are likely to become richer thereby, as <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Officiis i, 30). Therefore neither should we give abundantly to others.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Officiis i, 30): "We should not lavish our <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> on others all at once, we should dole it out by degrees." But to give abundantly is to give lavishly. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> should not be given in abundance.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/2co008.htm#verse13">2 Corinthians 8:13</a>): "Not that others should be eased," i.e. should live on you without working themselves, "and you burthened," i.e. impoverished. But this would be the result if <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> were given in abundance. Therefore we ought not to give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> abundantly.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/tob004.htm#verse93">Tobit 4:93</a>): "If thou have much, give abundantly."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">Alms</a> may be considered abundant in relation either to the giver, or to the recipient: in relation to the giver, when that which a man gives is great as compared with his means. To give thus is praiseworthy, wherefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> (<a href="../bible/luk021.htm#verse3">Luke 21:3-4</a>) commended the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> because "of her want, she cast in all the living that she had." Nevertheless those <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> must be observed which were laid down when we spoke of giving <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> out of one's <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> goods (9).

<p>On the part of the recipient, an <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> may be abundant in two ways; first, by relieving his need sufficiently, and in this sense it is praiseworthy to give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>: secondly, by relieving his need more than sufficiently; this is not praiseworthy, and it would be better to give to several that are in need, wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse3">1 Corinthians 13:3</a>): "If I should distribute . . . to feed the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>," on which words a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> comments: "Thus we are warned to be careful in giving <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, and to give, not to one only, but to many, that we may profit many."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument considers abundance of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> as exceeding the needs of the recipient.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The passage quoted considers abundance of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> on the part of the giver; but the sense is that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not wish a man to lavish all his <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> at once, except when he changes his state of life, wherefore he goes on to say: "Except we imitate Eliseus who slew his oxen and fed the poor with what he had, so that no household cares might keep him back" (<a href="../bible/1ki019.htm#verse21">1 Kings 19:21</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In the passage quoted the words, "not that others should be eased or refreshed," refer to that abundance of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> which surpasses the need of the recipient, to whom one should give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> not that he may have an easy life, but that he may have relief. Nevertheless we must bring discretion to bear on the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, on account of the various <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, some of whom are more daintily nurtured, and need finer food and clothing. Hence <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Officiis i, 30): "When you give an <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> to a man, you should take into consideration his age and his weakness; and sometimes the shame which proclaims his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> birth; and again that perhaps he has fallen from <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> to indigence through no fault of his own."

<p>With regard to the words that follow, "and you burdened," they refer to abundance on the part of the giver. Yet, as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says on the same passage, "he says this, not because it would be better to give in abundance, but because he <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> for the weak, and he admonishes them so to give that they lack not for themselves."
