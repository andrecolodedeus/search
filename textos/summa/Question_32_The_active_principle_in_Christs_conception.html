<h1>Question 32. The active principle in Christ's conception</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/4032.htm#article1"> Was the Holy Ghost the active principle of Christ's conception?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4032.htm#article2"> Can it be said that Christ was conceived of the Holy Ghost?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4032.htm#article3"> Can it be said that the Holy Ghost is Christ's father according to the flesh?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4032.htm#article4"> Did the Blessed Virgin cooperate actively in Christ's conception?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the accomplishment of Christ's conception should be attributed to the Holy Ghost?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the accomplishment of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> conception should not be attributed to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, because. as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. i), "The works of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> are indivisible, just as the Essence of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> is indivisible." But the accomplishment of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> conception was the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore it seems that it should not be attributed to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> any more than to the Father or the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse4">Galatians 4:4</a>): "When the fulness of time was come, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>"; which words <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> expounds by saying (De Trin. iv): "Sent, in so far as made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>." But the sending of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is especially attributed to the Father, as stated in I, 43, 8. Therefore His conception also, by reason of which He was "made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>," should be attributed principally to the Father.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/pro009.htm#verse1">Proverbs 9:1</a>): "Wisdom hath built herself a house." Now, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is Himself the Wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; according to <a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse24">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the Power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the Wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." And the house of this Wisdom is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, which is also called His temple, according to <a href="../bible/joh002.htm#verse21">John 2:21</a>: "But He spoke of the temple of His body." Therefore it seems that the accomplishment of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> conception should be attributed principally to the Son, and not, therefore, to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse35">Luke 1:35</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> shall come upon Thee."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The whole <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> effected the conception of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body: nevertheless, this is attributed to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, for three reasons. First, because this is befitting to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, considered on the part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is the love of Father and Son, as stated in I, 37, 1. Now, that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> took to Himself flesh from the Virgin's womb was due to the exceeding love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: wherefore it is said (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse16">John 3:16</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> so loved the world as to give His only-begotten Son."

<p>Secondly, this is befitting to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, on the part of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> assumed. Because we are thus given to understand that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was assumed by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> into the unity of Person, not by reason of its <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, but through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> alone; which is attributed to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse4">1 Corinthians 12:4</a>: "There are diversities of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>, but the same Spirit." Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion xl): "The manner in which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was born of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> . . . suggests to us the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, without any <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> going before, in the very beginning of his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> when he began to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> was joined to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Word, into so great unity of Person, that He Himself should be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>."

<p>Thirdly, because this is befitting the term of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>. For the term of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> was that that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who was being conceived, should be the Holy one and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Now, both of these are attributed to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. For by Him men are made to be sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse6">Galatians 4:6</a>: "Because you are sons, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath sent the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of His Son into your [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'our'] hearts, crying: <a href="../cathen/01006d.htm">Abba</a>, Father." Again, He is the "Spirit of sanctification," according to <a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse4">Romans 1:4</a>. Therefore, just as other men are sanctified spiritually by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; so as to be the adopted sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so was <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> conceived in sanctity by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, so as to be the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Hence, according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse4">Romans 1:4</a>, the words, "Who was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, in power," are explained by what immediately follows: "According to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of sanctification, i.e. through being conceived of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." And the <a href="../cathen/06330a.htm">Angel of the Annunciation</a> himself, after saying, "The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> shall come upon thee," draws the conclusion: "Therefore also the Holy which shall be born of thee shall be called the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The work of the conception is indeed common to the whole <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>; yet in some way it is attributed to each of the Persons. For to the Father is attributed authority in regard to the Person of the Son, who by this conception took to Himself (<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>). The taking itself (of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>) is attributed to the Son: but the formation of the body taken by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is attributed to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of the Son, according to <a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse6">Galatians 4:6</a>: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of His Son." For just as the power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is in the semen, through the spirit enclosed therein, fashions the body in the generation of other men, so the Power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is the Son Himself, according to <a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse24">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>: "Christ, the Power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> formed the body which He assumed. This is also shown by the words of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> shall come upon thee," as it were, in order to prepare and fashion the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body; "and the Power of the Most High," i.e. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, "shall overshadow thee--that is to say, the incorporeal Light of the Godhead shall in thee take the corporeal <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: for a shadow is formed by light and body," as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xviii). The "Most High" is the Father, whose Power is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The mission refers to the Person assuming, who is sent by the Father; but the conception refers to the body assumed, which is formed by the operation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. And therefore, though mission and conception are in the same subject; since they differ in our consideration of them, mission is attributed to the Father, but the accomplishment of the conception to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; whereas the assumption of flesh is attributed to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. Vet. et Nov. Test., qu. 52): "This may be understood in two ways. For, first, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> house is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which He built with His blood. Secondly, His body may be called His house, just as it is called His temple . . . and what is done by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is done by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, because Theirs is one <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> and one Will."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether it should be said that Christ was conceived of [de] the Holy Ghost?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that we should not say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was conceived of [de] the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Because on <a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse36">Romans 11:36</a>: "For of Him [ex ipso] and by Him, and in Him, are all things," the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says: "Notice that he does not say, 'of Him' [de ipso], but 'of Him' [ex ipso]. For of Him [ex ipso], are heaven and earth, since He made them: but not of Him [de ipso], since they are not made of His <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> did not form <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body of [de] His own <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Therefore we should not say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was conceived of [de] the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the active principle of [de] which something is conceived is as the seed in generation. But the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> did not take the place of seed in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> conception. For <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (Expos. Cathol. Fidei) [Written by Pelagius]: "We do not say, as some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> wretches hold, that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> took the place of seed: but we say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was wrought," i.e. formed, "by the power and might of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a>." Therefore we should not say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was conceived of [de] the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no one thing is made of two, except they be in some way mingled. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was formed of [de] the Virgin Mary. If therefore we say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was conceived of [de] the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, it seems that a mingling took place of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> with the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> supplied by the Virgin: and this is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Therefore we should not say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was conceived of [de] the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse18">Matthew 1:18</a>): "Before they came together, she was found with child, of [de] the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Conception is not attributed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body alone, but also to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself by reason of His body. Now, in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> we may observe a twofold habitude to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> Himself, who is said to have been conceived, He has a habitude of consubstantiality: while to His body He has the habitude of efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. And this preposition of [de] signifies both habitudes: thus we say that a certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is "of [de] his father." And therefore we can fittingly say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was conceived of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> in such a way that the efficiency of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> be referred to the body assumed, and the consubstantiality to the Person assuming.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, through not being consubstantial with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, cannot properly be said to be conceived "of" [de] the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, but rather "from [ex] the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>," as <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Spir. Sanct. ii.): "What is from someone is either from his <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> or from his power: from his <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, as the Son who is from the Father; from his power, as all things are from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, just as Mary conceived from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It seems that on this point there is a difference of opinion between <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> and certain other Doctors, who assert that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> took the place of seed in this conception. For <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. i in Matth. [Opus Imperf., among the supposititious writings): "When <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> Only-Begotten was about to enter into the Virgin, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> preceded Him; that by the previous entrance of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> might be born unto sanctification according to His body, the Godhead entering instead of the seed." And <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> wisdom and power overshadowed her, like unto a Divine seed."

<p>But these expressions are easily explained. Because <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> and <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> compare the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, or also the Son, who is the Power of the Most High, to seed, by reason of the active power therein; while <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> denies that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> took the place of seed, considered as a corporeal <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> which is transformed in conception.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion xl), <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is said to be conceived or born of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> in one sense; of the Virgin Mary in another--of the Virgin Mary materially; of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> efficiently. Therefore there was no mingling here.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the Holy Ghost should be called Christ's father in respect of His humanity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> should be called Christ's father in respect of His humanity. Because, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Gener. Animal. i): "The Father is the active principle in generation, the Mother supplies the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> is called Christ's Mother, by reason of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> which she supplied in His conception. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> can be called His father, through being the active principle in His conception.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of other <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men are fashioned by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, so also was <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body fashioned by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. But other <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, on account of the aforesaid fashioning, are called the children of the whole <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, and consequently of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should be called the Son of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, forasmuch as His body was fashioned by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is called our Father by reason of His having made us, according to <a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse6">Deuteronomy 32:6</a>: "Is not He thy Father, that hath possessed thee, and made thee and <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> thee?" But the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> made <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, as stated above (1,2). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> should be called Christ's Father in respect of the body fashioned by Him.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion xl): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was born of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> not as a Son, and of the Virgin Mary as a Son."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The words "fatherhood," "motherhood," and "sonship," result from generation; yet not from any generation, but from that of living things, especially animals. For we do not say that fire generated is the son of the fire generating it, except, perhaps, metaphorically; we speak thus only of animals in whom generation is more perfect. Nevertheless, the word "son" is not applied to everything generated in animals, but only to that which is generated into likeness of the generator. Wherefore, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion xxxix), we do not say that a hair which is generated in a man is his son; nor do we say that a man who is born is the son of the seed; for neither is the hair like the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> nor is the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> born like the seed, but like the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who begot him. And if the likeness be perfect, the sonship is perfect, whether in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But if the likeness be imperfect, the sonship is imperfect. Thus in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> there is a certain imperfect likeness to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, both as regards his being <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> image and as regards His being <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> unto the likeness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore in both ways <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can be called His son, both because he is <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> to His image and because he is likened to Him by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Now, it must be observed that what is said in its perfect sense of a thing should not be said thereof in its imperfect sense: thus, because <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> is said to be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> a man, in the proper sense of "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," never is he called <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the sense in which the portrait of a man is called a man, although, perhaps, he may resemble another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Now, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> in the perfect sense of sonship. Wherefore, although in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> He was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> and justified, He ought not to be called the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, either in respect of His being <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> or of His being justified, but only in respect of His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> generation, by reason of which He is the Son of the Father alone. Therefore nowise should <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> be called the Son of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, nor even of the whole <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was conceived of the Virgin Mary, who supplied the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of His conception unto likeness of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. For this reason He is called her Son. But as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> He was conceived of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> as the active principle of His conception, but not unto likeness of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as a man is born of his father. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not called the Son of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Men who are fashioned spiritually by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> cannot be called sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the perfect sense of sonship. And therefore they are called sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in respect of imperfect sonship, which is by reason of the likeness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which flows from the whole <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>.

<p>But with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> it is different, as stated above.

<p>The same reply avails for the Third Objection.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the Blessed Virgin cooperated actively in the conception of Christ's body?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> cooperated actively in the conception of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body. For <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii) that "the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> came upon the Virgin, purifying her, and bestowing on her the power to receive and to bring forth the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>." But she had from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> the passive power of generation, like any other <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. Therefore He bestowed on her an active power of generation. And thus she cooperated actively in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> conception.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, all the powers of the vegetative <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are active, as the <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Commentator</a> says (De Anima ii). But the generative power, in both <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, belongs to the vegetative <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore, both in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, it cooperates actively in the conception of the child.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in the conception of a child the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> supplies the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> from which the child's body is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> formed. But <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is an intrinsic principle of movement. Therefore it seems that in the very <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> supplied by the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> there was an active principle.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The active principle in generation is called the "seminal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>." But, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. x), <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body "was taken from the Virgin, only as to corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, by the Divine power of conception and formation, but not by any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> seminal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> did not cooperate actively in, the conception of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some say that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> cooperated actively in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> conception, both by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and by a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> power. By <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power, because they hold that in all <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> there is an active principle. otherwise they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that there would be no such thing as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> transformation. But in this they are deceived. Because a transformation is said to be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> by reason not only of an active but also of a passive intrinsic principle: for the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says expressly (Phys. viii) that in heavy and light things there is a passive, and not an active, principle of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> movement. Nor is it possible for <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to be active in its own formation, since it is not in act. Nor, again, is it possible for anything to put itself in motion except it be divided into two parts, one being the mover, the other being moved: which happens in animate things only, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> Phys. viii.

<p>By a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> power, because they say that the mother requires not only to supply the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, which is the menstrual blood, but also the semen, which, being mingled with that of the male, has an active power in generation. And since in the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> there was no resolution of semen, by reason of her inviolate <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, they say that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> supernaturally bestowed on her an active power in the conception of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, which power other mothers have by reason of the semen resolved. But this cannot stand, because, since "each thing is on account of its operation" (De Coel. ii), <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> would not, for the purpose of the act of generation, distinguish the male and female sexes, unless the action of the male were distinct from that of the female. Now, in generation there are two distinct operations--that of the agent and that of the patient. Wherefore it follows that the entire active operation is on the part of the male, and the passive on the part of the female. For this reason in plants, where both forces are mingled, there is no distinction of male and female.

<p>Since, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> was not Christ's Father, but His Mother, it follows that it was not given to her to exercise an active power in His conception: whether to cooperate actively so as to be His Father, or not to cooperate at all, as some say. whence it would follow that this active power was bestowed on her to no purpose. We must therefore say that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> conception itself she did not cooperate actively, but merely supplied the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> thereof. Nevertheless, before the conception she cooperated actively in the preparation of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> so that it should be apt for the conception.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This conception had three privileges--namely, that it was without <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>; that it was not that of a man only, but of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; and that it was a virginal conception. And all three were effected by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says, as to the first, that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> "came upon the Virgin, purifying her"--that is, preserving her from conceiving with <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. As to the second, he says: "And bestowing on her the power to receive," i.e. to conceive, "the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>." As to the third, he says: "And to give birth" to Him, i.e. that she might, while remaining a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, bring Him forth, not actively, but passively, just as other mothers achieve this through the action of the male seed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The generative power of the female is imperfect compared to that of the male. And, therefore, just as in the arts the inferior art gives a disposition to the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to which the higher art gives the form, as is stated Phys. ii, so also the generative power of the female prepares the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, which is then fashioned by the active power of the male.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In order for a transformation to be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, there is no need for an active principle in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but only for a passive principle, as stated above.
