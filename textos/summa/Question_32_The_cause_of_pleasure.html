<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether operation is the proper cause of pleasure?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that operation is not the proper and first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure. For, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. i, 11), "pleasure consists in a perception of the senses," since <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is requisite for pleasure, as stated above (Question 31, Article 1). But the objects of operations are knowable before the operations themselves. Therefore operation is not the proper <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, pleasure consists especially in an end gained: since it is this that is chiefly desired. But the end is not always an operation, but is sometimes the effect of the operation. Therefore operation is not the proper and direct <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, leisure and rest consist in cessation from work: and they are objects of pleasure (Rhet. i, 11). Therefore operation is not the proper <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 12,13; x, 4) that "pleasure is a connatural and uninterrupted operation."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 31, Article 1), two things are requisite for pleasure: namely, the attainment of the suitable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of this attainment. Now each of these consists in a kind of operation: because actual <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is an operation; and the attainment of the suitable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is by means of an operation. Moreover, the proper operation itself is a suitable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Wherefore every pleasure must needs be the result of some operation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The objects of operations are not pleasurable save inasmuch as they are united to us; either by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> alone, as when we take pleasure in thinking of or looking at certain things; or in some other way in addition to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; as when a man takes pleasure in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that he has something <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>--<a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, or the like; which would not be pleasurable unless they were apprehended as possessed. For as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> observes (Polit. ii, 2) "we take great pleasure in looking upon a thing as our own, by reason of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love we have for ourselves." Now to have such like things is nothing else but to use them or to be able to use them: and this is through some operation. Wherefore it is evident that every pleasure is traced to some operation as its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Even when it is not an operation, but the effect of an operation, that is the end, this effect is pleasant in so far as possessed or effected: and this implies use or operation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Operations are pleasant, in so far as they are proportionate and connatural to the agent. Now, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> power is finite, operation is proportionate thereto according to a certain measure. Wherefore if it exceed that measure, it will be no longer proportionate or pleasant, but, on the contrary, painful and irksome. And in this sense, leisure and play and other things pertaining to repose, are pleasant, inasmuch as they banish sadness which results from labor.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether movement is a cause of pleasure?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that movement is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure. Because, as stated above (Question 31, Article 1), the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is obtained and is actually possessed, is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 12) that pleasure is not compared with generation, but with the operation of a thing already in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. Now that which is being moved towards something has it not as yet; but, so to speak, is being generated in its regard, forasmuch as generation or corruption are united to every movement, as stated in Phys. viii, 3. Therefore movement is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, movement is the chief <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of toil and fatigue in our works. But operations through being toilsome and fatiguing are not pleasant but disagreeable. Therefore movement is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, movement implies a certain innovation, which is the opposite of custom. But things "which we are accustomed to, are pleasant," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. i, 11). Therefore movement is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. viii, 3): "What means this, O Lord my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whereas Thou art everlasting <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> to Thyself, and some things around Thee evermore rejoice in Thee? What means this, that this portion of things ebbs and flows alternately displeased and reconciled?" From these words we gather that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> rejoices and takes pleasure in some kind of alterations: and therefore movement seems to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> pleasure.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Three things are requisite for pleasure; two, i.e. the one that is pleased and the pleasurable object conjoined to him; and a third, which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of this conjunction: and in respect of these three, movement is pleasant, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 14 and Rhetor. i, 11). For as far as we who feel pleasure are concerned, change is pleasant to us because our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is changeable: for which reason that which is suitable to us at one time is not suitable at another; thus to warm himself at a fire is suitable to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in winter but not in summer. Again, on the part of the pleasing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is united to us, change is pleasant. Because the continued action of an agent increases its effect: thus the longer a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> remains near the fire, the more he is warmed and dried. Now the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> mode of being consists in a certain measure; and therefore when the continued presence of a pleasant object exceeds the measure of one's <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> mode of being, the removal of that object becomes pleasant. On the part of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> itself (change becomes pleasant), because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> desires to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> something whole and perfect: when therefore a thing cannot be apprehended all at once as a whole, change in such a thing is pleasant, so that one part may pass and another succeed, and thus the whole be perceived. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. iv, 11): "Thou wouldst not have the syllables stay, but fly away, that others may come, and thou hear the whole. And so whenever any one thing is made up of many, all of which do not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> together, all would please collectively more than they do severally, if all could be perceived collectively."

<p>If therefore there be any thing, whose <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is unchangeable; the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> mode of whose being cannot be exceeded by the continuation of any pleasing object; and which can behold the whole object of its delight at once--to such a one change will afford no delight. And the more any pleasures approach to this, the more are they capable of being continual.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although the subject of movement has not yet perfectly that to which it is moved, nevertheless it is beginning to have something thereof: and in this respect movement itself has something of pleasure. But it falls short of the perfection of pleasure; because the more perfect pleasures regard things that are unchangeable. Moreover movement becomes the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure, in so far as thereby something which previously was unsuitable, becomes suitable or ceases to be, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Movement <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> toil and fatigue, when it exceeds our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> aptitude. It is not thus that it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> pleasure, but by removing the obstacles to our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> aptitude.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> What is customary becomes pleasant, in so far as it becomes <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>: because custom is like a second <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But the movement which gives pleasure is not that which departs from custom, but rather that which prevents the corruption of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> mode of being, that might result from continued operation. And thus from the same <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of connaturalness, both custom and movement become pleasant.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether hope and memory causes pleasure?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> and hope do not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> pleasure. Because pleasure is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by present <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 12). But hope and <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> regard what is absent: since <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> is of the past, and hope of the future. Therefore <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> and hope do not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> pleasure.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the same thing is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of contraries. But hope <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> affliction, according to <a href="../bible/pro013.htm#verse12">Proverbs 13:12</a>: "Hope that is deferred afflicteth the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>." Therefore hope does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> pleasure.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as hope agrees with pleasure in regarding <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, so also do desire and love. Therefore hope should not be assigned as a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure, any more than desire or love.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse12">Romans 12:12</a>): "Rejoicing in hope"; and (<a href="../bible/psa076.htm#verse4">Psalm 76:4</a>): "I remembered <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and was delighted."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Pleasure is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the presence of suitable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, in so far as it is felt, or perceived in any way. Now a thing is present to us in two ways. First, in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>--i.e. according as the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> is in the knower by its likeness; secondly, in reality--i.e. according as one thing is in real conjunction of any kind with another, either actually or <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a>. And since real conjunction is greater than conjunction by likeness, which is the conjunction of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; and again, since actual is greater than <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a> conjunction: therefore the greatest pleasure is that which arises from sensation which requires the presence of the sensible object. The second place belongs to the pleasure of hope, wherein there is pleasurable conjunction, not only in respect of apprehension, but also in respect of the faculty or power of obtaining the pleasurable object. The third place belongs to the pleasure of <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, which has only the conjunction of apprehension.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Hope and <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> are indeed of things which, absolutely speaking, are absent: and yet those are, after a fashion, present, i.e. either according to apprehension only; or according to apprehension and possibility, at least supposed, of attainment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Nothing prevents the same thing, in different ways, being the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of contraries. And so hope, inasmuch as it implies a present appraising of a future <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> pleasure; whereas, inasmuch as it implies absence of that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> affliction.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Love and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> also <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> pleasure. For everything that is loved becomes pleasing to the lover, since love is a kind of union or connaturalness of lover and beloved. In like manner every object of desire is pleasing to the one that desires, since desire is chiefly a craving for pleasure. However hope, as implying a <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of the real presence of the pleasing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, that is not implied either by love or by <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, is reckoned in preference to them as <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> pleasure; and also in preference to <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, which is of that which has already passed away.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether sadness causes pleasure?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that sadness does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> pleasure. For nothing <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> its own contrary. But sadness is contrary to pleasure. Therefore it does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> it.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, contraries have contrary effects. But pleasures, when called to mind, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> pleasure. Therefore sad things, when remembered, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> sorrow and not pleasure.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as sadness is to pleasure, so is <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> to love. But <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> love, but rather the other way about, as stated above (Question 29, Article 2). Therefore sadness does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> pleasure.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa041.htm#verse4">Psalm 41:4</a>): "My tears have been my bread day and night": where bread denotes the refreshment of pleasure. Therefore tears, which arise from sadness, can give pleasure.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Sadness may be considered in two ways: as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> actually, and as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>: and in both ways sadness can <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> pleasure. Because sadness, as actually <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a>, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> pleasure, inasmuch as it brings to mind that which is loved, the absence of which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> sadness; and yet the mere thought of it gives pleasure. The recollection of sadness becomes a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure, on account of the deliverance which ensued: because absence of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is looked upon as something <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; wherefore so far as a man thinks that he has been delivered from that which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him sorrow and pain, so much reason has he to rejoice. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in De Civ. Dei xxii, 31 [<a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, Moral. iv.] that "oftentimes in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> we call to mind sad things . . . and in the season of health we recall past pains without feeling pain . . . and in proportion are the more filled with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">gladness</a>": and again (Confess. viii, 3) he says that "the more peril there was in the battle, so much the more <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> will there be in the triumph."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Sometimes <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> a thing is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of its contrary: thus "that which is cold sometimes <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> heat," as stated in Phys. viii, 1. In like manner sadness is the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure, in so far as it gives rise to the apprehension of something pleasant.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Sad things, called to mind, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> pleasure, not in so far as they are sad and contrary to pleasant things; but in so far as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is delivered from them. In like manner the recollection of pleasant things, by reason of these being lost, may <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> sadness.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Hatred also can be the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of love: i.e. so far as some love one another, inasmuch as they agree in hating one and the same thing.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the actions of others are a cause of pleasure to us?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the actions of others are not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure to us. Because the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure is our own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> when conjoined to us. But the actions of others are not conjoined to us. Therefore they are not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure to us.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the action is the agent's own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. If, therefore, the actions of others are a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure to us, for the same reason all goods belonging to others will be pleasing to us: which is evidently <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, action is pleasant through proceeding from an innate <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>; hence it is stated in Ethic. ii, 3 that "we must reckon the pleasure which follows after action, as being the sign of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in us." But the actions of others do not proceed from <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in us, but, sometimes, from <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the agents. Therefore the actions of others are not pleasing to us, but to the agents themselves.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written in the <a href="../bible/2jo001.htm#verse4">second canonical epistle of John (verse 4)</a>: "I was exceeding glad that I found thy children walking in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (01; 31, 1), two things are requisite for pleasure, namely, the attainment of one's proper <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of having obtained it. Wherefore the action of another may <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> pleasure to us in three ways. First, from the fact that we obtain some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> through the action of another. And in this way, the actions of those who do some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to us, are pleasing to us: since it is pleasant to be benefited by another. Secondly, from the fact that another's action makes us to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> or appreciate our own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: and for this reason men take pleasure in being praised or <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> by others, because, to wit, they thus become aware of some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in themselves. And since this appreciation receives greater weight from the testimony of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and wise men, hence men take greater pleasure in being praised and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> by them. And because a flatterer appears to praise, therefore flattery is pleasing to some. And as love is for something <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, while admiration is for something great, so it is pleasant to be loved and admired by others, inasmuch as a man thus becomes aware of his own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or greatness, through their giving pleasure to others. Thirdly, from the fact that another's actions, if they be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, are reckoned as one's own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, by reason of the power of love, which makes a man to regard his friend as one with himself. And on account of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, which makes one to reckon another's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as being in opposition to oneself, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> action of an enemy becomes an object of pleasure: whence it is written (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse6">1 Corinthians 13:6</a>) that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> "rejoiceth not in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, but rejoiceth with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Another's action may be conjoined to me, either by its effect, as in the first way, or by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, as in the second way; or by affection, as in the third way.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument avails for the third mode, but not for the first two.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although the actions of another do not proceed from <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> that are in me, yet they either produce in me something that gives pleasure; or they make me appreciate or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of mind; or they proceed from the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of one who is united to me by love.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether doing good to another is a cause of pleasure?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to another is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure. Because pleasure is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by one's obtaining one's proper <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as stated above (1,5; 31, 1). But doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> pertains not to the obtaining but to the spending of one's proper <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore it seems to be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sadness rather than of pleasure.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 1) that "illiberality is more connatural to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> than prodigality." Now it is a mark of prodigality to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to others; while it is a mark of illiberality to desist from doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Since therefore everyone takes pleasure in a connatural operation, as stated in Ethic. vii, 14 and x, 4, it seems that doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to others is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, contrary effects proceed from contrary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> takes a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> pleasure in certain kinds of ill-doing, such as overcoming, contradicting or scolding others, or, if he be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, in punishing them, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. i, 11). Therefore doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to others is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sadness rather than pleasure.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Polit. ii, 2) that "it is most pleasant to give presents or assistance to friends and strangers."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to another may give pleasure in three ways. First, in consideration of the effect, which is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> conferred on another. In this respect, inasmuch as through being united to others by love, we look upon their <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as being our own, we take pleasure in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> we do to others, especially to our friends, as in our own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Secondly, in consideration of the end; as when a man, from doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to another, hopes to get some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for himself, either from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: for hope is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure. Thirdly, in consideration of the principle: and thus, doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to another, can give pleasure in respect of a threefold principle. One is the faculty of doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: and in this regard, doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to another becomes pleasant, in so far as it arouses in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> an <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> of abundant <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in him, whereof he is able to give others a share. Wherefore men take pleasure in their children, and in their own works, as being things on which they bestow a share of their own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Another principle is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> inclination to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, by reason of which doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> becomes connatural to him: for which reason the liberal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> takes pleasure in giving to others. The third principle is the motive: for instance when a man is moved by one whom he loves, to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to someone: for whatever we do or suffer for a friend is pleasant, because love is the principal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Spending gives pleasure as showing forth one's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But in so far as it empties us of our own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> it may be a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sadness; for instance when it is excessive.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Prodigality is an excessive spending, which is unnatural: wherefore prodigality is said to be contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> To overcome, to contradict, and to punish, give pleasure, not as tending to another's ill, but as pertaining to one's own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> loves more than he <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> another's ill. For it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> pleasant to overcome, inasmuch as it makes a man to appreciate his own superiority. Wherefore all those games in which there is a striving for the mastery, and a possibility of winning it, afford the greatest pleasure: and speaking generally all contests, in so far as they admit hope of victory. To contradict and to scold can give pleasure in two ways. First, as making <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> himself to be wise and excellent; since it belongs to wise men and elders to reprove and to scold. Secondly, in so far as by scolding and reproving, one does <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to another: for this gives one pleasure, as stated above. It is pleasant to an <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to punish, in so far as he thinks himself to be removing an apparent slight, which seems to be due to a previous hurt: for when a man is hurt by another, he seems to be slighted thereby; and therefore he wishes to be quit of this slight by paying back the hurt. And thus it is clear that doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to another may be of itself pleasant: whereas doing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to another is not pleasant, except in so far as it seems to affect one's own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether likeness is a cause of pleasure?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that likeness is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure. Because ruling and presiding seem to imply a certain unlikeness. But "it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to take pleasure in ruling and presiding," as stated in Rhetor. i, 11. Therefore unlikeness, rather than likeness, is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, nothing is more unlike pleasure than sorrow. But those who are burdened by sorrow are most inclined to seek pleasures, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 14). Therefore unlikeness, rather than likeness, is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, those who are satiated with certain delights, derive not pleasure but disgust from them; as when one is satiated with food. Therefore likeness is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Likeness is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of love, as above stated (27, 3): and love is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure. Therefore likeness is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Likeness is a kind of unity; hence that which is like us, as being one with us, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> pleasure; just at it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> love, as stated above (Question 27, Article 3). And if that which is like us does not hurt our own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but increase it, it is pleasurable simply; for instance one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in respect of another, one youth in relation to another. But if it be hurtful to our own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, thus <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> disgust or sadness, not as being like and one with us, but as hurtful to that which is yet more one with us.

<p>Now it happens in two ways that something like is hurtful to our own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. First, by destroying the measure of our own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, by a kind of excess; because <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, especially bodily <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as health, is conditioned by a certain measure: wherefore superfluous <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or any bodily pleasure, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> disgust. Secondly, by being directly contrary to one's own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: thus a potter dislikes other potters, not because they are potters, but because they deprive him of his own excellence or profits, which he seeks as his own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Since ruler and subject are in communion with one another, there is a certain likeness between them: but this likeness is conditioned by a certain superiority, since ruling and presiding pertain to the excellence of a man's own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: because they belong to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who are wise and better than others; the result being that they give <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of his own excellence. Another reason is that by ruling and presiding, a man does <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to others, which is pleasant.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> That which gives pleasure to the sorrowful <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, though it be unlike sorrow, bears some likeness to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that is sorrowful: because sorrows are contrary to his own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Wherefore the sorrowful <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> seeks pleasure as making for his own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, in so far as it is a remedy for its contrary. And this is why bodily pleasures, which are contrary to certain sorrows, are more sought than <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> pleasures, which have no contrary sorrow, as we shall state later on (35, 5). And this explains why all animals <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> desire pleasure: because animals ever work through sense and movement. For this reason also young people are most inclined to seek pleasures; on account of the many changes to which they are subject, while yet growing. Moreover this is why the melancholic has a strong desire for pleasures, in order to drive away sorrow: because his "body is corroded by a base humor," as stated in Ethic. vii, 14.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Bodily goods are conditioned by a certain fixed measure: wherefore surfeit of such things destroys the proper <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and consequently gives rise to disgust and sorrow, through being contrary to the proper <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether wonder is a cause of pleasure?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that wonder is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure. Because wonder is the act of one who is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of something, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says. But <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, rather than <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure. Therefore wonder is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, wonder is the beginning of wisdom, being as it were, the road to the search of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as stated in the beginning of Metaph. i, 2. But "it is more pleasant to think of what we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, than to seek what we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. x, 7): since in the latter case we encounter difficulties and hindrances, in the former not; while pleasure arises from an operation which is unhindered, as stated in Ethic. vii, 12,13. Therefore wonder hinders rather than <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> pleasure.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, everyone takes pleasure in what he is accustomed to: wherefore the actions of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> acquired by custom, are pleasant. But "we wonder at what is unwonted," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. xxiv in Joan.). Therefore wonder is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. i, 11) that wonder is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is pleasant to get what one desires, as stated above (Question 23, Article 4): and therefore the greater the desire for the thing loved, the greater the pleasure when it is attained: indeed the very increase of desire brings with it an increase of pleasure, according as it gives rise to the hope of obtaining that which is loved, since it was stated above (3, ad 3) that desire resulting from hope is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure. Now wonder is a kind of desire for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; a desire which comes to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> when he sees an effect of which the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> either is unknown to him, or surpasses his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or faculty of understanding. Consequently wonder is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure, in so far as it includes a hope of getting the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which one desires to have. For this reason whatever is wonderful is pleasing, for instance things that are scarce. Also, representations of things, even of those which are not pleasant in themselves, give rise to pleasure; for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> rejoices in comparing one thing with another, because comparison of one thing with another is the proper and connatural act of the reason, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Poet. iv). This again is why "it is more delightful to be delivered from great danger, because it is something wonderful," as stated in Rhetor. i, 11.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Wonder gives pleasure, not because it implies <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, but in so far as it includes the desire of learning the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and in so far as the wonderer learns something new, i.e. that the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is other than he had thought it to be. [According to another reading:--that he is other than he thought himself to be.]

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Pleasure includes two things; rest in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and perception of this rest. As to the former therefore, since it is more perfect to contemplate the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, than to seek for the unknown, the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of what we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, is in itself more pleasing than the research of what we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. Nevertheless, as to the second, it happens that research is sometimes more pleasing <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, in so far as it proceeds from a greater desire: for greater desire is awakened when we are conscious of our <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. This is why <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> takes the greatest pleasure in finding or learning things for the first time.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is pleasant to do what we are wont to do, inasmuch as this is connatural to us, as it were. And yet things that are of rare occurrence can be pleasant, either as regards <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, from the fact that we desire to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> something about them, in so far as they are wonderful; or as regards action, from the fact that "the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is more inclined by desire to act intensely in things that are new," as stated in Ethic. x, 4, since more perfect operation <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> more perfect pleasure.
