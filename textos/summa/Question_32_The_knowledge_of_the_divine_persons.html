<h1>Question 32. The knowledge of the divine persons</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1032.htm#article1"> Can the divine persons be known by natural reason?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1032.htm#article2"> Are notions to be attributed to the divine persons?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1032.htm#article3"> The number of the notions</a> <li><a href="../summa/1032.htm#article4"> May we lawfully have various contrary opinions of these notions?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the trinity of the divine persons can be known by natural reason?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the trinity of the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. For <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> came to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> not otherwise than by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Now we find that they said many things about the trinity of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, for <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> says (De Coelo et Mundo i, 2): "Through this number"--namely, three--"we bring ourselves to acknowledge the greatness of one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, surpassing all things <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>." And <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. vii, 9): "I have read in their works, not in so many words, but enforced by many and various reasons, that in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," and so on; in which passage the distinction of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is laid down. We read, moreover, in a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/rom001.htm">Romans 1</a> and <a href="../bible/exo008.htm">Exodus 8</a> that the magicians of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> failed in the third sign--that is, as regards <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of a third <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>--i.e. of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> --and thus it is clear that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> at least two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Likewise Trismegistus says: "The <a href="../cathen/10447b.htm">monad</a> begot a <a href="../cathen/10447b.htm">monad</a>, and reflected upon itself its own heat." By which words the generation of the Son and procession of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> seem to be indicated. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> can be obtained by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/13045c.htm">Richard St. Victor</a> says (De Trin. i, 4): "I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that probable and even <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> arguments can be found for any explanation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." So even to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> some have brought forward a reason from the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who communicates Himself <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> in the procession of the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; while some are moved by the consideration that "no <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thing can be joyfully possessed without partnership." <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> proceeds (De Trin. x, 4; x, 11,12) to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the trinity of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> by the procession of the word and of love in our own mind; and we have followed him in this (27, 1 and 3). Therefore the trinity of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it seems to be superfluous to teach what cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. But it ought not to be said that the divine tradition of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> is superfluous. Therefore the trinity of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (De Trin. i), "Let no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> think to reach the sacred <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of generation by his own mind." And <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Fide ii, 5), "It is impossible to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the secret of generation. The mind fails, the voice is silent." But the trinity of the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is distinguished by origin of generation and procession (30, 2). Since, therefore, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and with his understanding grasp that for which no <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> reason can be given, it follows that the trinity of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by reason.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is impossible to attain to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. For, as above explained (12, 4, 12), <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot obtain the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> except from creatures. Now creatures lead us to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as effects do to their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Accordingly, by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> we can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that only which of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> belongs to Him as the principle of things, and we have cited this fundamental principle in treating of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as above (Question 12, Article 12). Now, the creative power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is common to the whole <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>; and hence it belongs to the unity of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, and not to the distinction of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Therefore, by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> we can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what belongs to the unity of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, but not what belongs to the distinction of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Whoever, then, tries to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the trinity of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, derogates from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in two ways.

<p>Firstly, as regards the dignity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself, which consists in its being concerned with invisible things, that exceed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>; wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says that "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is of things that appear not" (<a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse1">Hebrews 11:1</a>), and the same <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says also, "We speak wisdom among the perfect, but not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world; but we speak the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> which is hidden" (<a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse6">1 Corinthians 2:6-7</a>).

<p>Secondly, as regards the utility of drawing others to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For when anyone in the endeavor to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> brings forward reasons which are not cogent, he falls under the ridicule of the unbelievers: since they suppose that we stand upon such reasons, and that we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> on such grounds.

<p>Therefore, we must not attempt to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> what is of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, except by authority alone, to those who receive the authority; while as regards others it suffices to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that what <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> teaches is not impossible. Hence it is said by <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. ii): "Whoever wholly resists the word, is far off from our <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>; whereas if he regards the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the word"--i.e. "the sacred word, we too follow this rule."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the trinity of the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> by its proper attributes, such as paternity, filiation, and procession, according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle's</a> words, "We speak the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> which none of the princes of the world"--i.e. the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>--"<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>" (<a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse6">1 Corinthians 2:6</a>). Nevertheless, they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> some of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> attributes appropriated to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, as power to the Father, wisdom to the Son, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; as will later on appear. So, when <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> said, "By this number," etc., we must not take it as if he affirmed a threefold number in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but that he wished to say that the ancients used the threefold number in their <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> on account of some perfection residing in the number three. In the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> books also we find, "In the beginning was the word," not as meaning the Person begotten in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but as meaning the ideal type whereby <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made all things, and which is appropriated to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. And although they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> these were appropriated to the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, yet they are said to have failed in the third sign--that is, in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the third <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, because they deviated from the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> appropriated to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, in that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "they did not glorify Him as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm">Romans 1</a>); or, because the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a> asserted the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of one Primal Being whom they also declared to be the father of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, they consequently maintained the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of another <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> beneath him, which they called "mind" or the "paternal <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>," containing the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of all things, as Macrobius relates (Som. Scip. iv). They did not, however, assert the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of a third separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> which might correspond to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. So also we do not assert that the Father and the Son differ in <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, which was the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> and <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, who in this followed the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a>. When Trismegistus says, "<a href="../cathen/10447b.htm">Monad</a> begot <a href="../cathen/10447b.htm">monad</a>," etc., this does not refer to the generation of the Son, or to the procession of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, but to the production of the world. For one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> produced one world by reason of His love for Himself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason</a> may be employed in two ways to establish a point: firstly, for the purpose of furnishing sufficient <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of some principle, as in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> science, where sufficient <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> can be brought to show that the movement of the heavens is always of uniform velocity. <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason</a> is employed in another way, not as furnishing a sufficient <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of a principle, but as confirming an already established principle, by showing the congruity of its results, as in astrology the theory of eccentrics and epicycles is considered as established, because thereby the sensible appearances of the heavenly movements can be explained; not, however, as if this <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> were sufficient, forasmuch as some other theory might explain them. In the first way, we can <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is one; and the like. In the second way, reasons avail to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>; as, when assumed to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, such reasons confirm it. We must not, however, think that the trinity of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is adequately <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by such reasons. This becomes evident when we consider each point; for the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is manifested also in creation, because to produce from nothing is an act of <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power. For if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> communicates Himself by His <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> effect should proceed from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: but that according to its own mode and capacity it should receive the divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Likewise, when it is said that joyous possession of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> requires partnership, this holds in the case of one not having perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>: hence it needs to share some other's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, in order to have the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of complete <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Nor is the image in our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> an adequate <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> in the case of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, forasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and ourselves univocally. Hence, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. xxvii. in Joan.) that by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> we arrive at <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and not conversely.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There are two reason why the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for us. It was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the right <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of creation. The fact of saying that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made all things by His Word excludes the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of those who say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> produced things by <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. When we say that in Him there is a procession of love, we show that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> produced creatures not because He needed them, nor because of any other extrinsic reason, but on account of the love of His own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. So <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, when he had said, "In the beginning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth," subjoined, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> said, Let there be light," to manifest the divine Word; and then said, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> saw the light that it was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," to show <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the divine love. The same is also found in the other works of creation. In another way, and chiefly, that we may think rightly concerning the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, accomplished by the Incarnate Son, and by the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there are no notions. For <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. i): "We must not dare to say anything of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> but what is taught to us by the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Scripture</a>." But <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Scripture</a> does not say anything concerning notions. Therefore there are none in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, all that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> concerns the unity of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> or the trinity of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. But the notions do not concern the unity of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, nor the trinity of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; for neither can what belongs to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> be predicated of the notions: for instance, we do not say that paternity is wise or creates; nor can what belongs to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> be so predicated; for example, we do not say that paternity begets, nor that filiation is begotten. Therefore there do not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> notions in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, we do not require to presuppose any abstract notions as principles of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> things which are devoid of composition: for they are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of themselves. But the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are supremely simple. Therefore we are not to suppose any notions in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 5): "We recognize difference of hypostases [i.e. of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>], in the three properties; i.e. in the paternal, the filial, and the processional." Therefore we must admit properties and notions in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Prepositivus, considering the simplicity of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, said that in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there were no properties or notions, and wherever there were mentioned, he propounded the abstract for the concrete. For as we are accustomed to say, "I beseech your kindness"--i.e. you who are kind--so when we speak of paternity in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we mean <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father.

<p>But, as shown above (3, 3, ad 1), the use of concrete and abstract names in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not in any way repugnant to the divine simplicity; forasmuch as we always name a thing as we understand it. Now, our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> cannot attain to the absolute simplicity of the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, considered in itself, and therefore, our <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> apprehends and names divine things, according to its own mode, that is in so far as they are found in sensible objects, whence its <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is derived. In these things we use abstract terms to signify simple forms; and to signify subsistent things we use concrete terms. Hence also we signify divine things, as above stated, by abstract names, to express their simplicity; whereas, to express their subsistence and completeness, we use concrete names.

<p>But not only must <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> names be signified in the abstract and in the concrete, as when we say Deity and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; or wisdom and wise; but the same applies to the personal names, so that we may say paternity and Father.

<p>Two chief motives for this can be cited. The first arises from the obstinacy of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. For since we confess the Father, the Son, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> to be one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, to those who ask: "Whereby are They one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>? and whereby are They three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>?" as we answer that They are one in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> or deity; so there must also be some abstract terms whereby we may answer that the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are distinguished; and these are the properties or notions signified by an abstract term, as paternity and filiation. Therefore the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is signified as "What"; and the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> as "Who"; and the property as "Whereby."

<p>The second motive is because one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is related to two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>--namely, the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Father to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Son and the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. This is not, however, by one relation; otherwise it would follow that the Son also and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> would be related to the Father by one and the same relation. Thus, since relation alone multiplies the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, it would follow that the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> would not be two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Nor can it be said with Prepositivus that as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is related in one way to creatures, while creatures are related to Him in divers ways, so the Father is related by one relation to the Son and to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; whereas these two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are related to the Father by two relations. For, since the very specific <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a relation is that it refers to another, it must be said that two relations are not specifically different if but one opposite relation corresponds to them. For the relation of lord and father must differ according to the difference of filiation and servitude. Now, all creatures are related to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as His creatures by one specific relation. But the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are not related to the Father by one and the same kind of relation. Hence there is no parity.

<p>Further, in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is no need to admit any real relation to the creature (28, 1,3); while there is no reason against our admitting in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, many <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> relations. But in the Father there must be a real relation to the Son and to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Hence, corresponding to the two relations of the Son and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, whereby they are related to the Father, we must understand two relations in the Father, whereby He is related to the Son and to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Hence, since there is only one Person of the Father, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the relations should be separately signified in the <a href="../cathen/01074a.htm">abstract</a>; and these are what we mean by properties and notions.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although the notions are not mentioned in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Scripture</a>, yet the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are mentioned, comprising the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of notions, as the abstract is contained in the concrete.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the notions have their significance not after the manner of realities, but by way of certain <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> whereby the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; although in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> these notions or relations are real, as stated above (Question 28, Article 1). Therefore whatever has order to any <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> or personal act, cannot be applied to the notions; forasmuch as this is against their mode of signification. Hence we cannot say that paternity begets, or creates, or is wise, or is <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a>. The essentials, however, which are not ordered to any act, but simply remove <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, can be predicated of the notions; for we can say that paternity is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, or immense, or such like. So also on account of the real identity, substantive terms, whether personal or <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a>, can be predicated of the notions; for we can say that paternity is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that paternity is the Father.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are simple, still without prejudice to their simplicity, the proper <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> can be abstractedly signified, as above explained.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether there are five notions?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there are not five notions. For the notions proper to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are the relations whereby they are distinguished from each other. But the relations in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are only four (28, 4). Therefore the notions are only four in number.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as there is only one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He is called one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and because in Him there are three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, He is called the Trine <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore, if in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there are five notions, He may be called quinary; which cannot be allowed.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if there are five notions for the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, there must be in some one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> two or more notions, as in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Father there is innascibility and paternity, and common spiration. Either these three notions really differ, or not. If they really differ, it follows that the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Father is composed of several things. But if they differ only <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a>, it follows that one of them can be predicated of another, so that we can say that as the divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is the same as the divine wisdom by reason of the common reality, so common spiration is paternity; which is not to be admitted. Therefore there are not five notions.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It seems that there are more; because as the Father is from no one, and therefrom is derived the notion of innascibility; so from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> no other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> proceeds. And in this respect there ought to be a sixth notion.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, as the Father and the Son are the common origin of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, so it is common to the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> to proceed from the Father. Therefore, as one notion is common to the Father and the Son, so there ought to be one notion common to the Son and to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A notion is the proper <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> whereby we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> a divine Person. Now the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are multiplied by reason of their origin: and origin includes the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of someone from whom another comes, and of someone that comes from another, and by these two modes a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Therefore the Person of the Father cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the fact that He is from another; but by the fact that He is from no one; and thus the notion that belongs to Him is called "innascibility." As the source of another, He can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in two ways, because as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is from Him, the Father is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the notion of "paternity"; and as the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is from Him, He is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the notion of "common spiration." The Son can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as begotten by another, and thus He is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by "filiation"; and also by another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> proceeding from Him, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and thus He is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in the same way as the Father is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, by "common spiration." The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the fact that He is from another, or from others; thus He is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by "procession"; but not by the fact that another is from Him, as no divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> proceeds from Him.

<p>Therefore, there are Five notions in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: "innascibility," "paternity," "filiation," "common spiration" and "procession." Of these only four are relations, for "innascibility" is not a relation, except by reduction, as will appear later (33, 4, ad 3). Four only are properties. For "common spiration" is not a property; because it belongs to two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Three are personal notions--i.e. constituting <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, "paternity," "filiation," and "procession." "Common spiration" and "innascibility" are called notions of Persons, but not personal notions, as we shall explain further on (40, 1, ad 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Besides the four relations, another notion must be admitted, as above explained.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is signified as a reality; and likewise the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are signified as realities; whereas the notions are signified as <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> notifying the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Therefore, although <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is one by unity of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, and trine by trinity of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, nevertheless He is not quinary by the five notions.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Since the real plurality in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is founded only on relative opposition, the several properties of one Person, as they are not relatively opposed to each other, do not really differ. Nor again are they predicated of each other, because they are different <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; as we do not say that the attribute of power is the attribute of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, although we do say that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Since Person implies dignity, as stated above (Question 19, Article 3) we cannot derive a notion of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> from the fact that no <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is from Him. For this does not belong to His dignity, as it belongs to the authority of the Father that He is from no one.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> do not agree in one special mode of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> derived from the Father; as the Father and the Son agree in one special mode of producing the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. But the principle on which a notion is based must be something special; thus no parity of reasoning <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether it is lawful to have various contrary opinions of notions?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is not lawful to have various contrary opinions of the notions. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. i, 3): "No <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is more dangerous than any as regards the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>": to which <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> the notions assuredly belong. But contrary opinions must be in some way <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>. Therefore it is not right to have contrary opinions of the notions.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the notions. But no contrary opinion concerning the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is to be tolerated. Therefore neither can there be about the notions.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The notions are not <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a>. Therefore different opinions of the notions are permissible.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Anything is of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in two ways; directly, where any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> comes to us principally as divinely taught, as the trinity and unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> of the Son, and the like; and concerning these <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinion of itself involves <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, especially if it be held obstinately. A thing is of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, indirectly, if the denial of it involves as a consequence something against <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; as for instance if anyone said that Samuel was not the son of Elcana, for it follows that the divine <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> would be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Concerning such things anyone may have a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinion without danger of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, before the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> has been considered or settled as involving consequences against <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and particularly if no obstinacy be shown; whereas when it is manifest, and especially if the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has decided that consequences follow against <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, then the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> cannot be free from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. For this reason many things are now considered as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> which were formerly not so considered, as their consequences are now more manifest.

<p>So we must decide that anyone may entertain contrary opinions about the notions, if he does not mean to uphold anything at variance with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. If, however, anyone should entertain a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinion of the notions, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> or thinking that consequences against the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> would follow, he would lapse into <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.

<p>By what has been said all the objections may be solved.
