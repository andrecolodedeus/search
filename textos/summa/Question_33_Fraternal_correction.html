<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether fraternal correction is an act of charity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that fraternal correction is not an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse15">Matthew 18:15</a>, "If thy brother shall offend against thee," says that "a man should reprove his brother out of zeal for <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>." But <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is a distinct <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore fraternal correction is an act, not of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, but of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, fraternal correction is given by secret admonition. Now admonition is a kind of counsel, which is an act of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, for a <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is one who is of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel (Ethic. vi, 5). Therefore fraternal correction is an act, not of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, but of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, contrary acts do not belong to the same <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now it is an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> to bear with a sinner, according to <a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse2">Galatians 6:2</a>: "Bear ye one another's burdens, and so you shall fulfil the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>," which is the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore it seems that the correction of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> brother, which is contrary to bearing with him, is not an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> To correct the wrongdoer is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> almsdeed. But almsdeeds are works of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as stated above (Question 32, Article 1). Therefore fraternal correction is an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The correction of the wrongdoer is a remedy which should be employed against a man's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now a man's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may be considered in two ways, first as being harmful to the sinner, secondly as conducing to the harm of others, by hurting or scandalizing them, or by being detrimental to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of which is disturbed by that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>Consequently the correction of a wrongdoer is twofold, one which applies a remedy to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> considered as an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of the sinner himself. This is fraternal correction properly so called, which is directed to the amendment of the sinner. Now to do away with anyone's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is the same as to procure his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: and to procure a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, whereby we wish and do our friend well. Consequently fraternal correction also is an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, because thereby we drive out our brother's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, viz. <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the removal of which pertains to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> rather than the removal of an external loss, or of a bodily injury, in so much as the contrary <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is more akin to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> than the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the body or of external things. Therefore fraternal correction is an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> rather than the healing of a bodily infirmity, or the relieving of an external bodily need. There is another correction which applies a remedy to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the wrongdoer, considered as hurtful to others, and especially to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. This correction is an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, whose concern it is to safeguard the rectitude of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> between one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> speaks of the second correction which is an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Or if it speaks of the first correction, then it takes <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> as denoting a general <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as we shall state further on (58, 5), in which sense again all "<a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>" (<a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse4">1 John 3:4</a>), through being contrary to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vi, 12), <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> regulates whatever is directed to the end, about which things counsel and choice are concerned. Nevertheless when, guided by <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, we perform some action aright which is directed to the end of some <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, such as <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> or <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, that action belongs chiefly to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to whose end it is directed. Since, then, the admonition which is given in fraternal correction is directed to the removal of a brother's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which removal pertains to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, it is evident that this admonition is chiefly an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> commands it, so to speak, but secondarily an act of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, which executes and directs the action.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Fraternal correction is not opposed to forbearance with the weak, on the contrary it results from it. For a man bears with a sinner, in so far as he is not disturbed against him, and retains his goodwill towards him: the result being that he strives to make him do better.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether fraternal correction is a matter of precept?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that fraternal correction is not a matter of precept. For nothing impossible is a matter of precept, according to the saying of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> [Pelagius, Expos. Symb. ad Damas]: "Accursed be he who says that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has commanded any. thing impossible." Now it is written (<a href="../bible/ecc007.htm#verse14">Ecclesiastes 7:14</a>): "Consider the works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can correct whom He hath despised." Therefore fraternal correction is not a matter of precept.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, all the precepts of the Divine Law are reduced to the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">Decalogue</a>. But fraternal correction does not come under any precept of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">Decalogue</a>. Therefore it is not a matter of precept.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the omission of a Divine precept is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which has no place in a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Yet <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> men are found to omit <a href="../cathen/04394a.htm">fraternal correction</a>: since <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei i, 9): "Not only those of low degree, but also those of high position, refrain from reproving others, moved by a guilty cupidity, not by the claims of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>." Therefore fraternal correction is not a matter of precept.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, whatever is a matter of precept is something due. If, therefore, fraternal correction is a matter of precept, it is due to our brethren that we correct them when they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now when a man owes anyone a material due, such as the payment of a sum of money, he must not be content that his creditor come to him, but he should seek him out, that he may pay him his due. Hence we should have to go seeking for those who need correction, in order that we might correct them; which appears to be inconvenient, both on account of the great number of sinners, for whose correction one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> could not suffice, and because religious would have to leave the cloister in order to reprove men, which would be unbecoming. Therefore fraternal correction is not a matter of precept.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Verb. Dom. xvi, 4): "You become worse than the sinner if you fail to correct him." But this would not be so unless, by this neglect, one omitted to observe some precept. Therefore fraternal correction is a matter of precept.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Fraternal correction is a matter of precept. We must observe, however, that while the negative precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> forbid <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> acts, the positive precepts inculcate acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> acts are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in themselves, and cannot become <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, no matter how, or when, or where, they are done, because of their very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> they are connected with an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> end, as stated in Ethic. ii, 6: wherefore negative precepts bind always and for all times. On the other hand, acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> must not be done anyhow, but by observing the due circumstances, which are requisite in order that an act be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>; namely, that it be done where, when, and how it ought to be done. And since the disposition of whatever is directed to the end depends on the formal aspect of the end, the chief of these circumstances of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> act is this aspect of the end, which in this case is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. If therefore such a circumstance be omitted from a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> act, as entirely takes away the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, such an act is contrary to a precept. If, however, the circumstance omitted from a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> act be such as not to destroy the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> altogether, though it does not perfectly attain the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, it is not against a precept. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. ii, 9) says that if we depart but little from the mean, it is not contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, whereas if we depart much from the mean <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is destroyed in its act. Now fraternal correction is directed to a brother's amendment: so that it is a matter of precept, in so far as it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for that end, but not so as we have to correct our erring brother at all places and times.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> action is not efficacious without the Divine assistance: and yet <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> must do what is in his power. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Correp. et Gratia xv): "Since we ignore who is predestined and who is not, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> should so guide our feelings, that we wish all to be saved." Consequently we ought to do our brethren the kindness of correcting them, with the hope of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> help.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above (32, 5, ad 4), all the precepts about rendering service to our neighbor are reduced to the precept about the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> due to parents.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Fraternal correction may be omitted in three ways.

<p>First, meritoriously, when out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> one omits to correct someone. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei i, 9): "If a man refrains from chiding and reproving wrongdoers, because he awaits a suitable time for so doing, or because he <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> lest, if he does so, they may become worse, or hinder, oppress, or turn away from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, others who are weak and need to be instructed in a life of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, this does not seem to result from <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, but to be counselled by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>."

<p>Secondly, fraternal correction may be omitted in such a way that one commits a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, namely, "when" (as he says in the same passage) "one <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> what people may think, or lest one may suffer grievous pain or death; provided, however, that the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is so dominated by such things, that it gives them the preference to fraternal <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>." This would seem to be the case when a man reckons that he might probably withdraw some wrongdoer from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and yet omits to do so, through fear or <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>.

<p>Thirdly, such an omission is a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, when through fear or <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, a man is loth to correct his brother's faults, and yet not to such a degree, that if he saw clearly that he could withdraw him from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he would still forbear from so doing, through fear or <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, because in his own mind he prefers fraternal <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> to these things. It is in this way that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men sometimes omit to correct wrongdoers.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> We are bound to pay that which is due to some fixed and certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, whether it be a material or a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, without waiting for him to come to us, but by taking proper steps to find him. Wherefore just as he that owes money to a creditor should seek him, when the time comes, so as to pay him what he owes, so he that has <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> charge of some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is bound to seek him out, in order to reprove him for a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. On the other hand, we are not bound to seek someone on whom to bestow such favors as are due, not to any certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, but to all our neighbors in general, whether those favors be material or <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods, but it suffices that we bestow them when the opportunity occurs; because, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 28), we must look upon this as a matter of chance. For this reason he says (De Verb. Dom. xvi, 1) that "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> warns us not to be listless in regard of one another's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: not indeed by being on the lookout for something to denounce, but by correcting what we see": else we should become spies on the lives of others, which is against the saying of <a href="../bible/pro024.htm#verse19">Proverbs 24:19</a>: "Lie not in wait, nor seek after <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> in the house of the just, nor spoil his rest." It is evident from this that there is no need for religious to leave their cloister in order to rebuke <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>-doers.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether fraternal correction belongs only to prelates?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that fraternal correction belongs to <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> alone. For <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> [<a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, Hom. vii in Joan.] says: "Let <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> endeavor to fulfil this saying of the Gospel: 'If thy brother <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against thee,'" etc. Now <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> having charge of others were usually designated under the name of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Therefore it seems that fraternal correction belongs to <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> alone.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, fraternal correction is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. Now corporal almsgiving belongs to those who are placed above others in temporal matters, i.e. to the rich. Therefore fraternal correction belongs to those who are placed above others in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> matters, i.e. to <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, when one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> reproves another he moves him by his rebuke to something better. Now in the physical order the inferior is moved by the superior. Therefore in the order of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> also, which follows the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it belongs to <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> alone to correct inferiors.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (Dist. xxiv, qu. 3, Can. Tam Sacerdotes): "Both <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and all the rest of the faithful should be most solicitous for those who perish, so that their reproof may either correct their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> ways. or, if they be incorrigible, cut them off from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), correction is twofold. One is an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which seeks in a special way the recovery of an erring brother by means of a simple warning: such like correction belongs to anyone who has <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, be he subject or prelate.

<p>But there is another correction which is an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> purposing the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is procured not only by warning one's brother, but also, sometimes, by punishing him, that others may, through fear, desist from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Such a correction belongs only to <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, whose business it is not only to admonish, but also to correct by means of punishments.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Even as regards that fraternal correction which is common to all, <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> have a grave responsibility, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei i, 9): "for just as a man ought to bestow temporal favors on those especially of whom he has temporal care, so too ought he to confer <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> favors, such as correction, teaching and the like, on those who are entrusted to his <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> care." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> does not mean that the precept of fraternal correction concerns <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> only, but that it concerns them chiefly.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as he who has the means wherewith to give corporal assistance is rich in this respect, so he whose reason is gifted with a sane judgment, so as to be able to correct another's wrong-doing, is, in this respect, to be looked on as a superior.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Even in the physical order certain things act mutually on one another, through being in some respect higher than one another, in so far as each is somewhat in act, and somewhat in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> with regard to another. On like manner one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can correct another in so far as he has a sane judgment in a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> wherein the other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, though he is not his superior simply.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether a man is bound to correct his prelate?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is bound to correct his prelate. For it is written (<a href="../bible/exo019.htm#verse12">Exodus 19:12</a>): "The beast that shall touch the mount shall be stoned," [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Everyone that shall touch the mount, dying he shall die.'] and (<a href="../bible/2sa006.htm#verse7">2 Samuel 6:7</a>) it is related that the Lord struck Oza for touching the ark. Now the mount and the ark signify our <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> should not be corrected by their subjects.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse11">Galatians 2:11</a>, "I withstood him to the face," adds: "as an equal." Therefore, since a subject is not equal to his prelate, he ought not to correct him.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxiii, 8) that "one ought not to presume to reprove the conduct of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, unless one thinks better of oneself." But one ought not to think better of oneself than of one's prelate. Therefore one ought not to correct one's prelate.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in his Rule: "Show mercy not only to yourselves, but also to him who, being in the higher position among you, is therefore in greater danger." But fraternal correction is a work of mercy. Therefore even <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> ought to be corrected.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A subject is not competent to administer to his prelate the correction which is an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> through the coercive <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of punishment: but the fraternal correction which is an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is within the competency of everyone in respect of any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> towards whom he is bound by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, provided there be something in that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> which requires correction.

<p>Now an act which proceeds from a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> or power extends to whatever is contained under the object of that power or <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>: thus vision extends to all things comprised in the object of sight. Since, however, a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> act needs to be moderated by due circumstances, it follows that when a subject corrects his prelate, he ought to do so in a becoming manner, not with impudence and harshness, but with gentleness and respect. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse1">1 Timothy 5:1</a>): "An ancient <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> rebuke not, but entreat him as a father." Wherefore <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> finds fault with the monk Demophilus (Ep. viii), for rebuking a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> with insolence, by striking and turning him out of the church.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a subject touches his prelate inordinately when he upbraids him with insolence, as also when he speaks ill of him: and this is signified by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> condemnation of those who touched the mount and the ark.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> To withstand anyone in public exceeds the mode of <a href="../cathen/04394a.htm">fraternal correction</a>, and so <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> would not have withstood <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> then, unless he were in some way his equal as regards the defense of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But one who is not an equal can reprove privately and respectfully. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> in writing to the Colossians (<a href="../bible/col004.htm#verse17">4:17</a>) tells them to admonish their prelate: "Say to Archippus: Fulfil thy ministry [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.' Cf. <a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#verse5">2 Timothy 4:5</a>." It must be observed, however, that if the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> were endangered, a subject ought to rebuke his prelate even publicly. Hence <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, who was <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter's</a> subject, rebuked him in public, on account of the imminent danger of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and, as the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says on <a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse11">Galatians 2:11</a>, "<a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> gave an example to superiors, that if at any time they should happen to stray from the straight path, they should not disdain to be reproved by their subjects."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> To presume oneself to be simply better than one's prelate, would seem to savor of presumptuous <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>; but there is no presumption in thinking oneself better in some respect, because, in this life, no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is without some fault. We must also remember that when a man reproves his prelate charitably, it does not follow that he thinks himself any better, but merely that he offers his help to one who, "being in the higher position among you, is therefore in greater danger," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> observes in his Rule quoted above.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether a sinner ought to reprove a wrongdoer?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a sinner ought to reprove a wrongdoer. For no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is excused from obeying a precept by having committed a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But fraternal correction is a matter of precept, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Therefore it seems that a man ought not to forbear from such like correction for the reason that he has committed a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> almsdeeds are of more account than corporal <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsdeeds</a>. Now one who is in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> ought not to abstain from administering corporal <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. Much less therefore ought he, on account of a previous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, to refrain from correcting wrongdoers.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#verse8">1 John 1:8</a>): "If we say that we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we deceive ourselves." Therefore if, on account of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, a man is hindered from reproving his brother, there will be none to reprove the wrongdoer. But the latter proposition is unreasonable: therefore the former is also.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (De Summo Bono iii, 32): "He that is subject to <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> should not correct the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> of others." Again it is written (<a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse1">Romans 2:1</a>): "Wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself. For thou dost the same things which thou judgest."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (3, ad 2), to correct a wrongdoer belongs to a man, in so far as his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> is gifted with right judgment. Now <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated above (I-II, 85, 1,2), does not destroy the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> so as to deprive the sinner's reason of all right judgment, and in this respect he may be competent to find fault with others for committing <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Nevertheless a previous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> proves somewhat of a hindrance to this correction, for three reasons. First because this previous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> renders a man unworthy to rebuke another; and especially is he unworthy to correct another for a lesser <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, if he himself has committed a greater. Hence <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on the words, "Why seest thou the mote?" etc. (<a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse3">Matthew 7:3</a>): "He is speaking of those who, while they are themselves guilty of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, have no patience with the lesser <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of their brethren."

<p>Secondly, such like correction becomes unseemly, on account of the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> which ensues therefrom, if the corrector's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, because it would seem that he corrects, not out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, but more for the sake of ostentation. Hence the words of <a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse4">Matthew 7:4</a>, "How sayest thou to thy brother?" etc. are expounded by <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> [Hom. xvii in the Opus Imperfectum <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>] thus: "That is--'With what object?' Out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, think you, that you may save your neighbor?" No, "because you would look after your own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> first. What you want is, not to save others, but to hide your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> with <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> teaching, and to seek to be praised by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> for your <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>."

<p>Thirdly, on account of the rebuker's <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>; when, for instance, a man thinks lightly of his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and, in his own heart, sets himself above his neighbor, judging the latter's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> with harsh severity, as though he himself were just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 19): "To reprove the faults of others is the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and kindly men: when a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> rebukes anyone, his rebuke is the latter's acquittal." And so, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 19): "When we have to find fault with anyone, we should think whether we were never guilty of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and then we must remember that we are men, and might have been guilty of it; or that we once had it on our <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, but have it no longer: and then we should bethink ourselves that we are all weak, in order that our reproof may be the outcome, not of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, but of pity.

<p>But if we find that we are guilty of the same <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we must not rebuke him, but groan with him, and invite him to repent with us." It follows from this that, if a sinner reprove a wrongdoer with <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, he does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, nor does he bring a further condemnation on himself, although thereby he proves himself deserving of condemnation, either in his brother's or in his own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, on account of his previous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>Hence the Replies to the Objections are clear.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether one ought to forbear from correcting someone, through fear lest he become worse?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one ought not to forbear from correcting someone through fear lest he become worse. For <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is weakness of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa006.htm#verse3">Psalm 6:3</a>: "Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am weak." Now he that has charge of a sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, must not cease to take care of him, even if he be fractious or contemptuous, because then the danger is greater, as in the case of madmen. Much more, therefore should one correct a sinner, no matter how badly he takes it.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> vital <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> are not to be foregone on account of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> commandments are vital <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>. Since, therefore, fraternal correction is a matter of precept, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), it seems that it should not be foregone for fear of scandalizing the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to be corrected.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse8">Romans 3:8</a>) we should not do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> may come of it. Therefore, in like manner, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> should not be omitted lest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> befall. Now fraternal correction is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thing. Therefore it should not be omitted for fear lest the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> corrected become worse.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/pro009.htm#verse8">Proverbs 9:8</a>): "Rebuke not a scorner lest he <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> thee," where a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> remarks: "You must not fear lest the scorner insult you when you rebuke him: rather should you bear in mind that by making him <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> you, you may make him worse." Therefore one ought to forego <a href="../cathen/04394a.htm">fraternal correction</a>, when we fear lest we may make a man worse.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>) the correction of the wrongdoer is twofold. One, which belongs to <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, and is directed to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, has coercive force. Such correction should not be omitted lest the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> corrected be disturbed, both because if he is unwilling to amend his ways of his own accord, he should be made to cease <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> by being punished, and because, if he be incorrigible, the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is safeguarded in this way, since the order of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is observed, and others are deterred by one being made an example of. Hence a judge does not desist from pronouncing sentence of condemnation against a sinner, for fear of disturbing him or his friends.

<p>The other fraternal correction is directed to the amendment of the wrongdoer, whom it does not coerce, but merely admonishes. Consequently when it is deemed probable that the sinner will not take the warning, and will become worse, such fraternal correction should be foregone, because the means should be regulated according to the requirements of the end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctor</a> uses force towards a madman, who is unwilling to submit to his treatment; and this may be compared with the correction administered by <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, which has coercive power, but not with simple <a href="../cathen/04394a.htm">fraternal correction</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Fraternal correction is a matter of precept, in so far as it is an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and it will be a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> act in so far as it is proportionate to the end. Consequently whenever it is a hindrance to the end, for instance when a man becomes worse through it, it is longer a vital <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, nor is it a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> precept.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Whatever is directed to end, becomes <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> through being directed to the end. Hence whenever fraternal correction hinders the end, namely the amendment of our brother, it is no longer <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, so that when such a correction is omitted, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is not omitted lest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> should befall.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the precept of fraternal correction demands that a private admonition should precede denunciation?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the precept of fraternal correction does not demand that a private admonition should precede <a href="../cathen/04733b.htm">denunciation</a>. For, in works of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, we should above all follow the example of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse1">Ephesians 5:1-2</a>: "Be ye followers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as most dear children, and walk in love." Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sometimes punishes a man for a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, without previously warning him in secret. Therefore it seems that there is no need for a private admonition to precede <a href="../cathen/04733b.htm">denunciation</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Mendacio xv), we learn from the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men how we ought to understand the commandments of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>. Now among the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men we find that a hidden <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is publicly denounced, without any previous admonition in private. Thus we read (<a href="../bible/gen037.htm#verse2">Genesis 37:2</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> accused his brethren to his father of a most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> crime": and (<a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse4">Acts 5:4-9</a>) that <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> publicly denounced Ananias and Saphira who had secretly "by <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> kept back the price of the land," without beforehand admonishing them in private: nor do we read that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> admonished <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> in secret before denouncing him. Therefore the precept does not require that secret admonition should precede public <a href="../cathen/04733b.htm">denunciation</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is a graver <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to accuse than to denounce. Now one may go to the length of accusing a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> publicly, without previously admonishing him in secret: for it is decided in the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a> (Cap. Qualiter, xiv, De Accusationibus) that "nothing else need precede accusation except inscription." [The accuser was bound by <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman Law</a> to endorse (se inscribere) the writ of accusation. The effect of this endorsement or inscription was that the accuser bound himself, if he failed to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the accusation, to suffer the same punishment as the accused would have to suffer if <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> guilty.] Therefore it seems that the precept does not require that a secret admonition should precede public <a href="../cathen/04733b.htm">denunciation</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it does not seem probable that the customs observed by religious in general are contrary to the precepts of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Now it is customary among religious orders to proclaim this or that one for a fault, without any previous secret admonition. Therefore it seems that this admonition is not required by the precept.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, religious are bound to obey their <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>. Now a prelate sometimes commands either all in general, or someone in particular, to tell him if they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of anything that requires correction. Therefore it would seem that they are bound to tell them this, even before any secret admonition. Therefore the precept does not require secret admonition before public <a href="../cathen/04733b.htm">denunciation</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Verb. Dom. xvi, 4) on the words, "Rebuke him between thee and him alone" (<a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse15">Matthew 18:15</a>): "Aiming at his amendment, while avoiding his disgrace: since perhaps from shame he might begin to defend his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and him whom you thought to make a better <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, you make worse." Now we are bound by the precept of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> to beware lest our brother become worse. Therefore the order of fraternal correction comes under the precept.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> With regard to the public denunciation of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to make a distinction: because <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> may be either public or secret. On the case of public <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, a remedy is required not only for the sinner, that he may become better, but also for others, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, lest they be <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a>. Wherefore such like <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> should be denounced in public, according to the saying of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse20">1 Timothy 5:20</a>): "Them that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> reprove before all, that the rest also may have fear," which is to be understood as referring to public <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Verb. Dom. xvi, 7).

<p>On the other hand, in the case of secret <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, the words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> seem to apply (<a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse15">Matthew 18:15</a>): "If thy brother shall offend against thee," etc. For if he offend thee publicly in the presence of others, he no longer <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against thee alone, but also against others whom he 'disturbs. Since, however, a man's neighbor may take offense even at his secret <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, it seems that we must make yet a further distinction. For certain secret <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are hurtful to our neighbor either in his body or in his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as, for instance, when a man plots secretly to betray his country to its enemies, or when a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> secretly turns other men away from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. And since he that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> thus in secret, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not only against you in particular, but also against others, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to take steps to denounce him at once, in order to prevent him doing such harm, unless by chance you were firmly persuaded that this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> result would be prevented by admonishing him secretly. On the other hand there are other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which injure none but the sinner, and the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against, either because he alone is hurt by the sinner, or at least because he alone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> about his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and then our one purpose should be to succor our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> brother: and just as the physician of the body restores the sick <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to health, if possible, without cutting off a limb, but, if this be unavoidable, cuts off a limb which is least indispensable, in order to preserve the life of the whole body, so too he who desires his brother's amendment should, if possible, so amend him as regards his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, that he keep his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">good name</a>.

<p>For a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> name is useful, first of all to the sinner himself, not only in temporal matters wherein a man suffers many losses, if he lose his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">good name</a>, but also in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> matters, because many are restrained from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, through fear of dishonor, so that when a man finds his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> lost, he puts no curb on his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on <a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse15">Matthew 18:15</a>: "If he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against thee, thou shouldst rebuke him in private, lest he persist in his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> if he should once become shameless or unabashed." Secondly, we ought to safeguard our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> brother's <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">good name</a>, both because the dishonor of one leads to the dishonor of others, according to the saying of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Ep. ad pleb. Hipponens. lxxviii): "When a few of those who bear a name for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> are reported <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> or <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to have done anything wrong, people will seek by busily repeating it to make it <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> of all": and also because when one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is made public others are incited to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> likewise.

<p>Since, however, one's <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> should be preferred to a <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">good name</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> wished that we should publicly denounce our brother and so deliver his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, even though he should forfeit his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">good name</a>. Therefore it is evident that the precept requires a secret admonition to precede public <a href="../cathen/04733b.htm">denunciation</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Whatever is hidden, is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, wherefore hidden <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are to the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, just what public <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are to the judgment of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Nevertheless <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does rebuke sinners sometimes by secretly admonishing them, so to speak, with an inward inspiration, either while they wake or while they sleep, according to <a href="../bible/job033.htm#verse15">Job 33:15-17</a>: "By a dream in a vision by night, when deep sleep falleth upon men . . . then He openeth the ears of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and teaching instructeth them in what they are to learn, that He may withdraw a man from the things he is doing."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> as though it were public, wherefore He could have made it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> at once. Yet He did not, but warned <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in words that were obscure. The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of Ananias and Saphira was denounced by <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> acting as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> executor, by Whose <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. With regard to <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> it is probable that he warned his brethren, though <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> does not say so. Or we may say that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was public with regard to his brethren, wherefore it is stated in the plural that he accused "his brethren."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> When there is danger to a great number of people, those words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> do not apply, because then thy brother does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against thee alone.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Proclamations made in the chapter of religious are about little faults which do not affect a man's <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">good name</a>, wherefore they are reminders of forgotten faults rather than accusations or denunciations. If, however, they should be of such a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as to injure our brother's <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">good name</a>, it would be contrary to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> precept, to denounce a brother's fault in this manner.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> A prelate is not to be obeyed contrary to a Divine precept, according to <a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse29">Acts 5:29</a>: "We ought to obey <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> rather then men." Therefore when a prelate commands anyone to tell him anything that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> to need correction, the command rightly understood supports the safeguarding of the order of <a href="../cathen/04394a.htm">fraternal correction</a>, whether the command be addressed to all in general, or to some particular <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. If, on the other hand, a prelate were to issue a command in express opposition to this order instituted by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>, both would <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the one commanding, and the one obeying him, as disobeying <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> command. Consequently he ought not to be obeyed, because a prelate is not the judge of secret things, but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is, wherefore he has no power to command anything in respect of hidden matters, except in so far as they are made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through certain signs, as by ill-repute or suspicion; in which cases a prelate can command just as a judge, whether secular or ecclesiastical, can bind a man under <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to tell the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether before the public denunciation witnesses ought to be brought forward?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that before the public denunciation <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> ought not to be brought forward. For secret <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> ought not to be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to others, because by so doing "a man would betray his brother's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> instead of correcting them," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Verb. Dom. xvi, 7). Now by bringing forward <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> one makes <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> a brother's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to others. Therefore in the case of secret <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> one ought not to bring <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> forward before the public <a href="../cathen/04733b.htm">denunciation</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should love his neighbor as himself. Now no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> brings in <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> his own secret <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Neither therefore ought one to bring forward <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the secret <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of our brother.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> are brought forward to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> something. But <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> afford no <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> in secret matters. Therefore it is useless to bring <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> forward in such cases.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in his Rule that "before bringing it to the notice of <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> . . . it should be put before the superior." Now to bring a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> before a superior or a prelate is to tell the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> should not be brought forward before the public <a href="../cathen/04733b.htm">denunciation</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse16">Matthew 18:16</a>): "Take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two," etc.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The right way to go from one extreme to another is to pass through the middle space. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> wished the beginning of fraternal correction to be hidden, when one brother corrects another between this one and himself alone, while He wished the end to be public, when such a one would be denounced to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Consequently it is befitting that a citation of <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> should be placed between the two extremes, so that at first the brother's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be indicated to a few, who will be of use without being a hindrance, and thus his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be amended without dishonoring him before the public.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Some have understood the order of fraternal correction to demand that we should first of all rebuke our brother secretly, and that if he listens, it is well; but if he listen not, and his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be altogether hidden, they say that we should go no further in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, whereas if it has already begun to reach the ears of several by various signs, we ought to prosecute the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> command.

<p>But this is contrary to what <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in his Rule that "we are bound to reveal" a brother's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, if it "will <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a worse corruption in the heart." Wherefore we must say otherwise that when the secret admonition has been given once or several times, as long as there is probable hope of his amendment, we must continue to admonish him in private, but as soon as we are able to judge with any probability that the secret admonition is of no avail, we must take further steps, however secret the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may be, and call <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>, unless perhaps it were thought probable that this would not conduce to our brother's amendment, and that he would become worse: because on that account one ought to abstain altogether from correcting him, as stated above (<a href="#6">Article 6</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs no <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> that he may amend his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: yet they may be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that we may amend a brother's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Hence the comparison fails.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There may be three reasons for citing <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>. First, to show that the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> in question is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says: secondly, to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> was done, if repeated, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (in his Rule): thirdly, "to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who rebuked his brother, has done what he could," as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. in Matth. lx).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> means that the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> ought to be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the prelate before it is stated to the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>, in so far as the prelate is a private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> who is able to be of more use than others, but not that it is to be told him as to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, i.e. as holding the position of judge.
