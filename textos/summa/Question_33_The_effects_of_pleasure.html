<h1>Question 33. The effects of pleasure</h1>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether expansion is an effect of pleasure?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that expansion is not an effect of pleasure. For expansion seems to pertain more to love, according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse11">2 Corinthians 6:11</a>): "Our heart is enlarged." Wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/psa118.htm#verse96">Psalm 118:96</a>) concerning the precept of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: "Thy commandment is exceeding broad." But pleasure is a distinct passion from love. Therefore expansion is not an effect of pleasure.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, when a thing expands it is enabled to receive more. But receiving pertains to desire, which is for something not yet possessed. Therefore expansion seems to belong to desire rather than to pleasure.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, contraction is contrary to expansion. But contraction seems to belong to pleasure, for the hand closes on that which we wish to grasp firmly: and such is the affection of <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> in regard to that which pleases it. Therefore expansion does not pertain to pleasure.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> In order to express <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, it is written (<a href="../bible/isa060.htm#verse5">Isaiah 60:5</a>): "Thou shall see and abound, thy heart shall wonder and be enlarged." Moreover pleasure is called by the name of "laetitia" as being derived from "dilatatio" [expansion], as stated above (31, 3, ad 3).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Breadth [latitudo] is a dimension of bodily magnitude: hence it is not applied to the emotions of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, save metaphorically. Now expansion denotes a kind of movement towards breadth; and it belongs to pleasure in respect of the two things requisite for pleasure. One of these is on the part of the apprehensive power, which is cognizant of the conjunction with some suitable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. As a result of this apprehension, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> perceives that he has attained a certain perfection, which is a magnitude of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> order: and in this respect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> mind is said to be magnified or expanded by pleasure. The other requisite for pleasure is on the part of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, which acquiesces in the pleasurable object, and rests therein, offering, as it were, to enfold it within itself. And thus <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> affection is expanded by pleasure, as though it surrendered itself to hold within itself the object of its pleasure.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In metaphorical expressions nothing hinders one and the same thing from being attributed to different things according to different likenesses. And in this way expansion pertains to love by reason of a certain spreading out, in so far as the affection of the lover spreads out to others, so as to care, not only for his own interests, but also for what concerns others. On the other hand expansion pertains to pleasure, in so far as a thing becomes more ample in itself so as to become more capacious.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Desire includes a certain expansion arising from the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> of the thing desired; but this expansion increases at the presence of the pleasurable object: because the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> surrenders itself more to that object when it is already taking pleasure in it, than when it desires it before possessing it; since pleasure is the end of desire.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> He that takes pleasure in a thing holds it fast, by clinging to it with all his might: but he opens his heart to it that he may enjoy it perfectly.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether pleasure causes thirst or desire for itself?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that pleasure does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> desire for itself. Because all movement ceases when repose is reached. But pleasure is, as it were, a certain repose of the movement of desire, as stated above (23, 4; 25, 2). Therefore the movement of desire ceases when pleasure is reached. Therefore pleasure does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> desire.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a thing does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> its contrary. But pleasure is, in a way, contrary to desire, on the part of the object: since desire regards a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is not yet possessed, whereas pleasure regards the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that is possessed. Therefore pleasure does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> desire for itself.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, distaste is incompatible with desire. But pleasure often <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> distaste. Therefore it does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> desire.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse13">John 4:13</a>): "Whosoever drinketh of this water, shall thirst again": where, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Tract. xv in Joan.), water denotes pleasures of the body.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Pleasure can be considered in two ways; first, as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in reality; secondly, as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>. Again thirst, or desire, can be taken in two ways; first, properly, as denoting a craving for something not possessed; secondly, in general, as excluding distaste.

<p>Considered as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in reality, pleasure does not of itself <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> thirst or desire for itself, but only <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>; provided we take thirst or desire as denoting a craving for some thing not possessed: because pleasure is an emotion of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> in respect of something actually present. But it may happen that what is actually present is not perfectly possessed: and this may be on the part of the thing possessed, or on the part of the possessor. On the part of the thing possessed, this happens through the thing possessed not being a simultaneous whole; wherefore one obtains possession of it successively, and while taking pleasure in what one has, one desires to possess the remainder: thus if a man is pleased with the first part of a verse, he desires to hear the second part, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. iv, 11). In this way nearly all bodily pleasures <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> thirst for themselves, until they are fully realized, because pleasures of this kind arise from some movement: as is evident in pleasures of the table. On the part of the possessor, this happens when a man possesses a thing which is perfect in itself, yet does not possess it perfectly, but obtains possession of it little by little. Thus in this life, a faint perception of Divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> affords us delight, and delight sets up a thirst or desire for perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; in which sense we may understand the words of <a href="../bible/sir024.htm#verse29">Sirach 24:29</a>: "They that drink me shall yet thirst."

<p>On the other hand, if by thirst or desire we understand the mere intensity of the emotion, that excludes distaste, thus more than all others <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> pleasures <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> thirst or desire for themselves. Because bodily pleasures become distasteful by reason of their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> an excess in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> mode of being, when they are increased or even when they are protracted; as is evident in the case of pleasures of the table. This is why, when a man arrives at the point of perfection in bodily pleasures, he wearies of them, and sometimes desires another kind. Spiritual pleasures, on the contrary, do not exceed the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> mode of being, but perfect <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence when their point of perfection is reached, then do they afford the greatest delight: except, perchance, <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, in so far as the work of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> is accompanied by some operation of the bodily powers, which tire from protracted activity. And in this sense also we may understand those words of <a href="../bible/sir024.htm#verse29">Sirach 24:29</a>: "They that drink me shall yet thirst": for, even of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> perfectly, and delight in Him, it is written (<a href="../bible/1pe001.htm#verse12">1 Peter 1:12</a>) that they "desire to look at Him."

<p>Lastly, if we consider pleasure, not as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in reality, but as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, thus it has of itself a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> tendency to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> thirst and desire for itself: when, to wit, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> returns to that disposition, in which he was when he experienced the pleasure that is past. But if he be changed from that disposition, the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> of that pleasure does not give him pleasure, but distaste: for instance, the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> of food in respect of a man who has eaten to repletion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> When pleasure is perfect, then it includes complete rest; and the movement of desire, tending to what was not possessed, ceases. But when it is imperfect, then the desire, tending to what was not possessed, does not cease altogether.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> That which is possessed imperfectly, is possessed in one respect, and in another respect is not possessed. Consequently it may be the object of desire and pleasure at the same time.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Pleasures <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> distaste in one way, desire in another, as stated above.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether pleasure hinders the use of reason?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that pleasure does not hinder the use of reason. Because repose facilitates very much the due use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Phys. vii, 3) that "while we sit and rest, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is inclined to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>"; and it is written (<a href="../bible/wis008.htm#verse16">Wisdom 8:16</a>): "When I go into my house, I shall repose myself with her," i.e. wisdom. But pleasure is a kind of repose. Therefore it helps rather than hinders the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, things which are not in the same subject though they be contraries, do not hinder one another. But pleasure is in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> faculty, while the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> is in the apprehensive power. Therefore pleasure does not hinder the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that which is hindered by another, seems to be moved, as it were, thereby. But the use of an apprehensive power moves pleasure rather than is moved by it: because it is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure. Therefore pleasure does not hinder the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vi, 5), that "pleasure destroys the estimate of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As is stated in Ethic. x, 5, "appropriate pleasures increase activity . . . whereas pleasures arising from other sources are <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> to activity." Accordingly there is a certain pleasure that is taken in the very <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, as when one takes pleasure in contemplating or in reasoning: and such pleasure does not hinder the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, but helps it; because we are more attentive in doing that which gives us pleasure, and attention fosters activity.

<p>On the other hand bodily pleasures hinder the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> in three ways. First, by distracting the reason. Because, as we have just observed, we attend much to that which pleases us. Now when the attention is firmly fixed on one thing, it is either weakened in respect of other things, or it is entirely withdrawn from them; and thus if the bodily pleasure be great, either it entirely hinders the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, by concentrating the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind's</a> attention on itself; or else it hinders it considerably. Secondly, by being contrary to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Because some pleasures, especially those that are in excess, are contrary to the order of reason: and in this sense the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says that "bodily pleasures destroy the estimate of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, but not the speculative estimate," to which they are not opposed, "for instance that the three angles of a triangle are together equal to two right angles." In the first sense, however, they hinder both estimates. Thirdly, by fettering the reason: in so far as bodily pleasure is followed by a certain alteration in the body, greater even than in the other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, in proportion as the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is more vehemently affected towards a present than towards an absent thing. Now such bodily disturbances hinder the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>; as may be seen in the case of drunkards, in whom the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> is fettered or hindered.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Bodily pleasure implies indeed repose of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> in the object of pleasure; which repose is sometimes contrary to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>; but on the part of the body it always implies alteration. And in respect of both points, it hinders the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The powers of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> and of apprehension are indeed distinct parts, but belonging to the one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Consequently when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is very intent on the action of one part, it is hindered from attending to a contrary act of the other part.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> requires the due use of the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> and of the other sensitive powers, which are exercised through a bodily organ. Consequently alteration in the body hinders the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, because it hinders the act of the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> and of the other sensitive powers.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether pleasure perfects operation?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that pleasure does not perfect operation. For every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> operation depends on the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. But pleasure hinders the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). Therefore pleasure does not perfect, but weakens <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> operation.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, nothing perfects itself or its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But pleasure is an operation (Ethic. vii, 12; x, 4), i.e. either in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> or in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Therefore pleasure does not perfect operation.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if pleasure perfects operation, it does so either as end, or as form, or as agent. But not as end; because operation is not sought for the sake of pleasure, but rather the reverse, as stated above (Question 4, Article 2): nor as agent, because rather is it the operation that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> pleasure: nor again as form, because, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. x, 4), "pleasure does not perfect operation, as a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> does." Therefore pleasure does not perfect operation.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. x, 4) that "pleasure perfects operation."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Pleasure perfects operation in two ways. First, as an end: not indeed according as an end is that on "account of which a thing is"; but according as every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is added to a thing and completes it, can be called its end. And in this sense the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. x, 4) that "pleasure perfects operation . . . as some end added to it": that is to say, inasmuch as to this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is operation, there is added another <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is pleasure, denoting the repose of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> in a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that is presupposed. Secondly, as agent; not indeed directly, for the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. x, 4) that "pleasure perfects operation, not as a physician makes a man healthy, but as health does": but it does so indirectly; inasmuch as the agent, through taking pleasure in his action, is more eagerly intent on it, and carries it out with greater care. And in this sense it is said in Ethic. x, 5 that "pleasures increase their appropriate activities, and hinder those that are not appropriate."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is not every pleasure that hinders the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, but only bodily pleasure; for this arises, not from the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, but from the act of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty, which act is intensified by pleasure.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> pleasure that arises from the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, strengthens the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated in Phys. ii, 3 two things may be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of one another, if one be the efficient, the other the final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. And in this way, operation is the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure, while pleasure perfects operation by way of final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as stated above.

<p>The Reply to the Third Objection is evident for what has been said.
