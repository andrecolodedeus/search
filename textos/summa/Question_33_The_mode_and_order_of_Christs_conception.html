<h1>Question 33. The mode and order of Christ's conception</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/4033.htm#article1"> Was Christ's body formed in the first instant of its conception?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4033.htm#article2"> Was it animated in the first instant of its conception?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4033.htm#article3"> Was it assumed by the Word in the first instant of its conception?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4033.htm#article4"> Was this conception natural or miraculous?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether Christ's body was formed in the first instant of its conception?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was not formed in the first instant of its conception. For it is written (<a href="../bible/joh002.htm#verse20">John 2:20</a>): "Six-and-forty years was this Temple in building"; on which words <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> comments as follows (De Trin. iv): "This number applies manifestly to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> body." He says, further (QQ. lxxxiii, qu. 56): "It is not without reason that the Temple, which was a type of His body, is said to have been forty-six years in building: so that as many years as it took to build the Temple, in so many days was <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> body perfected." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was not perfectly formed in the first instant of its conception.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, there was need of local movement for the formation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body in order that the purest blood of the Virgin's body might be brought where generation might aptly take place. Now, no body can be moved locally in an instant: since the time taken in movement is divided according to the division of the thing moved, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> Phys. vi. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was not formed in an instant.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was formed of the purest blood of the Virgin, as stated above (Question 31, Article 5). But that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> could not be in the same instant both blood and flesh, because thus <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> would have been at the same time the subject of two forms. Therefore the last instant in which it was blood was distinct from the first instant in which it was flesh. But between any two instants there is an interval of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was not formed in an instant, but during a space of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, as the augmentative power requires a fixed time for its act, so also does the generative power: for both are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers belonging to the vegetative <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body took a fixed time to grow, like the bodies of other men: for it is written (<a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse52">Luke 2:52</a>) that He "advanced in wisdom and age." Therefore it seems for the same reason that the formation of His body, since that, too, belongs to the generative power, was not instantaneous, but took a fixed time, like the bodies of other men.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xviii): "As soon as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> announced it, as soon as the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> came down, the Word was in the womb, within the womb the Word was made flesh."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In the conception of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body three points may be considered: first, the local movement of the blood to the place of generation; secondly, the formation of the body from that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; thirdly, the development whereby it was brought to perfection of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. of these, the second is the conception itself; the first is a preamble; the third, a result of the conception.

<p>Now, the first could not be instantaneous: since this would be contrary to the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the local movement of any body whatever, the parts of which come into a place successively. The third also requires a succession of time: both because there is no increase without local movement, and because increase is effected by the power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> already informing the body, the operation of which power is subject to time.

<p>But the body's very formation, in which conception principally consists, was instantaneous, for two reasons. First, because of the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power of the agent, viz. the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, by whom <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was formed, as stated above (Question 32, Article 1). For the greater the power of an agent, the more quickly can it dispose <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; and, consequently, an agent of <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power can dispose <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> instantaneously to its due form. Secondly, on the part of the Person of the Son, whose body was being formed. For it was unbecoming that He should take to Himself a body as yet unformed. While, if the conception had been going on for any time before the perfect formation of the body, the whole conception could not be attributed to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, since it is not attributed to Him except by reason of the assumption of that body. Therefore in the first instant in which the various parts of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> were united together in the place of generation, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was both perfectly formed and assumed. And thus is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> said to have been conceived; nor could it be said otherwise.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Neither quotation from <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> refers to formation alone of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, but to its formation, together with a fixed development up to the time of His birth. Wherefore in the aforesaid number are foreshadowed the number of months during which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was in the Virgin's womb.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This local movement is not comprised within the conception itself, but is a preamble thereto.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is not possible to fix the last instant in which that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> was blood: but it is possible to fix the last period of time which continued without any interval up to the first instant in which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was formed. And this instant was the terminus of the time occupied by the local movement of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> towards the place of generation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Increase is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the augmentative power of that which is the subject of increase: but the formation of the body is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the generative power, not of that which is generated, but of the father generating from seed, in which the formative power derived from the father's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has its operation. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was not formed by the seed of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as stated above (31, 5, ad 3), but by the operation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Therefore the formation thereof should be such as to be worthy of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. But the development of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was the effect of the augmentative power in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: and since this was of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> as ours, it behooved His body to develop in the same way as the bodies of other men, so as to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the reality of His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether Christ's body was animated in the first instant of its conception?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was not animated in the first instant of its conception. For Pope Leo says (Ep. ad Julian.): "Christ's flesh was not of another <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> than ours: nor was the beginning of His animation different from that of other men." But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not infused into other men at the first instant of their conception. Therefore neither should <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> have been infused into His body in the first instant of its conception.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, like any <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> form, requires determinate <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> in its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But in the first instant of its conception <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was not of the same <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> as the bodies of other men when they are animated: otherwise, if afterwards its development had been continuous, either its birth would have occurred sooner, or at the time of birth He would have been a bigger child than others. The former alternative is contrary to what <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iv), where he proves that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was in the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin's</a> womb for the space of nine months: while the latter is contrary to what Pope Leo says (Serm. iv in Epiph.): "They found the child <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> nowise differing from the generality of infants." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was not animated in the first instant of its conception.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whenever there is "before" and "after" there must be several instants. But according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Gener. Animal. ii) in the generation of a man there must needs be "before" and "after": for he is first of all a living thing, and afterwards, an animal, and after that, a man. Therefore the animation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> could not be effected in the first instant of His conception.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii): "At the very instant that there was flesh, it was the flesh of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, it was flesh animated with a rational and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> For the conception to be attributed to the very <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, as we confess in the Creed, when we say, "who was conceived by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>," we must needs say that the body itself, in being conceived, was assumed by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>. Now it has been shown above (6, 1,2) that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> assumed the body by means of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by means of the spirit, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Wherefore in the first instant of its conception <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body must needs have been animated by the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The beginning of the infusion of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may be considered in two ways. First, in regard to the disposition of the body. And thus, the beginning of the infusion of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> into <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was the same as in other men's bodies: for just as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is infused into another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> body as soon as it is formed, so was it with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Secondly, this beginning may be considered merely in regard to time. And thus, because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was perfectly formed in a shorter space of time, so after a shorter space of time was it animated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> requires due <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> into which it is infused: but this <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> allows of a certain latitude because it is not fixed to a certain amount. Now the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> that a body has when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is first infused into it is in proportion to the perfect <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> to which it will attain by development: that is to say, men of greater stature have greater bodies at the time of first animation. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> at the perfect age was of becoming and middle stature: in proportion to which was the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of His body at the time when other men's bodies are animated; though it was less than theirs at the first instant of His conception. Nevertheless that <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> was not too small to safeguard the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an animated body; since it would have sufficed for the animation of a small <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> What the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in the generation of other men, because the body is successively formed and disposed for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: whence, first, as being imperfectly disposed, it receives an imperfect <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and afterwards, when it is perfectly disposed, it receives a perfect <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, on account of the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power of the agent, was perfectly disposed instantaneously. Wherefore, at once and in the first instant it received a perfect form, that is, the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether Christ's flesh was first of all conceived and afterwards assumed?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh was first of all conceived, and afterwards assumed. Because what is not cannot be assumed. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh began to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> when it was conceived. Therefore it seems that it was assumed by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> after it was conceived.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh was assumed by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, by means of the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But it received the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> at the term of the conception. Therefore it was assumed at the term of the conception. But at the term of the conception it was already conceived. Therefore it was first of all conceived and afterwards assumed.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in everything generated, that which is imperfect precedes in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> that which is perfect: which is made clear by the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. ix). But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is something generated. Therefore it did not attain to its ultimate perfection, which consisted in the union with the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, at the first instant of its conception; but, first of all, the flesh was conceived and afterwards assumed.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Fide ad Petrum xviii [Written by Fulgentius): "Hold steadfastly, and <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> not for a moment that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh was not conceived in the Virgin's womb, before being assumed by the Word."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above, we may say properly that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," but not that "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was made <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>": because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> took to Himself that which belongs to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>--and that which belongs to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> did not pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, as subsisting in itself, before being assumed by the Word. But if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh had been conceived before being assumed by the Word, it would have had at some time an hypostasis other than that of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>. And this is against the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, which we hold to consist in this, that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> was united to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and to all its parts in the unity of hypostasis: nor was it becoming that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> should, by assuming <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, destroy a pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> hypostasis of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or of any part thereof. It is consequently contrary to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to assert that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh was first of all conceived and afterwards assumed by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> If <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh had been formed or conceived, not instantaneously, but successively, one of two things would follow: either that what was assumed was not yet flesh, or that the flesh was conceived before it was assumed. But since we hold that the conception was effected instantaneously, it follows that in that flesh the beginning and the completion of its conception were in the same instant. So that, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [Fulgentius, De Fide ad Petrum xviii] says: "We say that the very <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> was conceived in taking flesh, and that His very flesh was conceived by the Word taking flesh."

<p>From the above the reply to the Second Objection is clear. For in the same moment that this flesh began to be conceived, its conception and animation were completed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> is not to be looked upon as an ascent, as it were, of a man already <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> and mounting up to the dignity of the Union: as the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> <a href="../cathen/12043a.htm">Photinus</a> maintained. Rather is it to be considered as a descent, by reason of the perfect <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> taking unto Himself the imperfection of our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; according to <a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse38">John 6:38</a>: "I came down from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>."

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether Christ's conception was natural?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> conception was <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is called the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> by reason of His conception in the flesh. But He is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>: as also is He the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Therefore His conception was <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no creature can be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> effect. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> conception is attributed to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, who is a mere creature: for we say that the Virgin conceived <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore it seems that His conception was not <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a>, but <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, for a transformation to be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, it is enough that the passive principle be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, as stated above (Question 32, Article 4). But in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> conception the passive principle on the part of His Mother was <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, as we have shown (32, 4). Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> conception was <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Ep. ad Caium Monach.): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> does in a superhuman way those things that pertain to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: this is shown in the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> virginal conception."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Incarn. vi): "In this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> thou shalt find many things that are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, and many that are <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>." For if we consider in this conception anything connected with the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> thereof, which was supplied by the mother, it was in all such things <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>. But if we consider it on the part of the active power, thus it was entirely <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a>. And since judgment of a thing should be pronounced in respect of its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> rather than of its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: and likewise in respect of its activity rather than of its passiveness: therefore is it that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> conception should be described simply as <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> and <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, although in a certain respect it was <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is said to be a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, by reason of His having a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, through which He is a <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, although He had it <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a>; thus, too, the blind <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to whom sight has been restored sees <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> by sight <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> received.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The conception is attributed to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, not as the active principle thereof, but because she supplied the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and because the conception took place in her womb.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> passive principle suffices for a transformation to be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, when it is moved by its proper active principle in a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and wonted way. But this is not so in the case in point. Therefore this conception cannot be called simply <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>.
