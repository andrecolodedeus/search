<h1>Question 33. The person of the Father</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1033.htm#article1"> Is the Father the Principle?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1033.htm#article2"> Is the person of the Father properly signified by this name "Father"?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1033.htm#article3"> Is "Father" in God said personally before it is said essentially?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1033.htm#article4"> Does it belong to the Father alone to be unbegotten?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether it belongs to the Father to be the principle?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the Father cannot be called the principle of the Son, or of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. For principle and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> are the same, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. iv). But we do not say that the Father is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. Therefore we must not say that He is the principle of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a principle is so called in relation to the thing principled. So if the Father is the principle of the Son, it follows that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> principled, and is therefore <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>; which appears <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the word principle is taken from priority. But in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is no "before" and "after," as <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> says. Therefore in speaking of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> we ought not to used the term principle.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iv, 20), "The Father is the Principle of the whole Deity."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The word "principle" signifies only that whence another proceeds: since anything whence something proceeds in any way we call a principle; and conversely. As the Father then is the one whence another proceeds, it follows that the Father is a principle.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The Greeks use the words "<a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>" and "principle" indifferently, when speaking of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; whereas the <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> Doctors do not use the word "<a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>," but only "principle." The reason is because "principle" is a wider term than "<a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>"; as "<a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>" is more common than "element." For the first term of a thing, as also the first part, is called the principle, but not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Now the wider a term is, the more suitable it is to use as regards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (13, 11), because the more special terms are, the more they determine the mode adapted to the creature. Hence this term "<a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>" seems to mean diversity of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, and dependence of one from another; which is not implied in the word "principle." For in all kinds of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> there is always to be found between the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and the effect a distance of perfection or of power: whereas we use the term "principle" even in things which have no such difference, but have only a certain order to each other; as when we say that a point is the principle of a line; or also when we say that the first part of a line is the principle of a line.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is the custom with the Greeks to say that the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are principled. This is not, however, the custom with our Doctors; because, although we attribute to the Father something of authority by reason of His being the principle, still we do not attribute any kind of subjection or inferiority to the Son, or to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, to avoid any occasion of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. In this way, <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (De Trin. ix): "By authority of the Giver, the Father is the greater; nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is not less to Whom oneness of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is give."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although this word principle, as regards its derivation, seems to be taken from priority, still it does not signify priority, but origin. For what a term signifies, and the reason why it was imposed, are not the same thing, as stated above (Question 13, Article 8).

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether this name "Father" is properly the name of a divine person?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that this name "Father" is not properly the name of a divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. For the name "Father" signifies relation. Moreover "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>" is an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Therefore this name "Father" is not properly a name signifying a Person.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a begetter is more common than father; for every father begets; but it is not so conversely. But a more common term is more properly applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated above (Question 13, Article 11). Therefore the more proper name of the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is begetter and genitor than Father.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a metaphorical term cannot be the proper name of anyone. But the word is by us metaphorically called begotten, or offspring; and consequently, he of whom is the word, is metaphorically called father. Therefore the principle of the Word in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not properly called Father.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, everything which is said properly of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> first before creatures. But generation appears to apply to creatures before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; because generation seems to be truer when the one who proceeds is distinct from the one whence it proceeds, not only by relation but also by <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Therefore the name "Father" taken from generation does not seem to be the proper name of any divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/psa088.htm#verse27">Psalm 88:27</a>): "He shall cry out to me: Thou art my Father."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The proper name of any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> signifies that whereby the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is distinguished from all other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. For as body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> belong to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, so to the concept of this particular <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> belong this particular <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and this particular body; and by these is this particular <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> distinguished from all other men. Now it is paternity which distinguishes the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Father from all other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Hence this name "Father," whereby paternity is signified, is the proper name of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Father.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Among us relation is not a subsisting <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. So this name "father" among us does not signify a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, but the relation of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. In <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, however, it is not so, as some wrongly thought; for in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the relation signified by the name "Father" is a subsisting <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Hence, as above explained (29, 4), this name "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>" in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> signifies a relation subsisting in the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Anima ii, text 49), a thing is denominated chiefly by its perfection, and by its end. Now generation signifies something in process of being made, whereas paternity signifies the complement of generation; and therefore the name "Father" is more expressive as regards the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> than genitor or begettor.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> the word is not a subsistence, and hence is not properly called begotten or son. But the divine Word is something subsistent in the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and hence He is properly and not metaphorically called Son, and His principle is called Father.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The terms "generation" and "paternity" like the other terms properly applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> before creatures as regards the thing signified, but not as regards the mode of signification. Hence also the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says, "I bend my knee to the Father of my Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, from whom all paternity in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and on earth is named" (<a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse14">Ephesians 3:14</a>). This is explained thus. It is manifest that generation receives its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the term which is the form of the thing generated; and the nearer it is to the form of the generator, the truer and more perfect is the generation; as univocal generation is more perfect than non-univocal, for it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of a generator to generate what is like itself in <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Hence the very fact that in the divine generation the form of the Begetter and Begotten is numerically the same, whereas in creatures it is not numerically, but only specifically, the same, shows that generation, and consequently paternity, is applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> before creatures. Hence the very fact that in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> a distinction <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> of the Begotten from the Begetter as regards relation only, belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the divine generation and paternity.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether this name "Father" is applied to God, firstly as a personal name?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that this name "Father" is not applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, firstly as a personal name. For in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> the common precedes the particular. But this name "Father" as a personal name, belongs to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Father; and taken in an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> sense it is common to the whole <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>; for we say "Our Father" to the whole <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>. Therefore "Father" comes first as an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> name before its personal sense.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in things of which the concept is the same there is no priority of predication. But paternity and filiation seem to be of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, according as a divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is Father of the Son, and the whole <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> is our Father, or the creature's; since, according to <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a> (Hom. xv, De Fide), to receive is common to the creature and to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. Therefore "Father" in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not taken as an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> name before it is taken personally.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is not possible to compare things which have not a common concept. But the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is compared to the creature by reason of filiation or generation, according to <a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse15">Colossians 1:15</a>: "Who is the image of the invisible <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of every creature." Therefore paternity taken in a personal sense is not prior to, but has the same concept as, paternity taken <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> comes before the temporal. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the Father of the Son from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>; while He is the Father of the creature in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Therefore paternity in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is taken in a personal sense as regards the Son, before it is so taken as regards the creature.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A name is applied to that wherein is perfectly contained its whole signification, before it is applied to that which only partially contains it; for the latter bears the name by reason of a kind of similitude to that which answers perfectly to the signification of the name; since all imperfect things are taken from perfect things. Hence this name "lion" is applied first to the animal containing the whole <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a lion, and which is properly so called, before it is applied to a man who shows something of a lion's <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, or strength, or the like; and of whom it is said by way of similitude.

<p>Now it is manifest from the foregoing (27, 2; 28, 4), that the perfect <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of paternity and filiation is to be found in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father, and in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Son, because one is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. But in the creature, filiation is found in relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not in a perfect manner, since the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a> and the creature have not the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; but by way of a certain likeness, which is the more perfect the nearer we approach to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of filiation. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is called the Father of some creatures, by reason only of a trace, for instance of irrational creatures, according to <a href="../bible/job038.htm#verse28">Job 38:28</a>: "Who is the father of the rain? or who begot the drops of dew?" Of some, namely, the rational creature (He is the Father), by reason of the likeness of His image, according to <a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse6">Deuteronomy 32:6</a>: "Is He not thy Father, who possessed, and made, and <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> thee?" And of others He is the Father by similitude of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and these are also called adoptive sons, as ordained to the heritage of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal glory</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which they have received, according to <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse16">Romans 8:16-17</a>: "The Spirit Himself gives testimony to our spirit that we are the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and if sons, heirs also." Lastly, He is the Father of others by similitude of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, forasmuch as they have obtained possession of the heritage of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse2">Romans 5:2</a>: "We <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the hope of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore it is plain that "paternity" is applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> first, as importing regard of one Person to another Person, before it imports the regard of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to creatures.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Common terms taken absolutely, in the order of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>, come before proper terms; because they are included in the understanding of proper terms; but not conversely. For in the concept of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Father, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is understood; but not conversely. But common terms which import relation to the creature come after proper terms which import personal relations; because the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> proceeding in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> proceeds as the principle of the production of creatures. For as the word conceived in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the artist is first understood to proceed from the artist before the thing designed, which is produced in likeness to the word conceived in the artist's mind; so the Son proceeds from the Father before the creature, to which the name of filiation is applied as it participates in the likeness of the Son, as is clear from the words of <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse29">Romans 8:29</a>: "Whom He foreknew and predestined to be made conformable to the image of His Son."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> To "receive" is said to be common to the creature and to the Son not in a univocal sense, but according to a certain remote similitude whereby He is called the First Born of creatures. Hence the authority quoted subjoins: "That He may be the First Born among many brethren," after saying that some were conformed to the image of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> possesses a position of singularity above others, in having by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> what He receives, as <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a> also declares (Hom. xv De Fide); hence He is called the only begotten (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse18">John 1:18</a>): "The only begotten Who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared unto us."

<p>From this appears the Reply to the Third Objection.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether it is proper to the Father to be unbegotten?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is not proper to the Father to be unbegotten. For every property supposes something in that of which it is the property. But "unbegotten" supposes nothing in the Father; it only removes something. Therefore it does not signify a property of the Father.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, Unbegotten is taken either in a privative, or in a negative sense. If in a negative sense, then whatever is not begotten can be called unbegotten. But the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is not begotten; neither is the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Therefore to be unbegotten belongs also to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; thus it is not proper to the Father. But if it be taken in a privative sense, as every privation signifies imperfection in the thing which is the subject of privation, it follows that the Person of the Father is imperfect; which cannot be.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, "unbegotten" does not signify relation, for it is not used relatively. Therefore it signifies <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>; therefore unbegotten and begotten differ in <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. But the Son, Who is begotten, does not differ from the Father in <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Therefore the Father ought not to be called unbegotten.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, property means what belongs to one alone. Since, then, there are more than one in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> proceeding from another, there is nothing to prevent several not receiving their being from another. Therefore the Father is not alone unbegotten.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, as the Father is the principle of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> begotten, so is He of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> proceeding. So if by reason of his opposition to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> begotten, it is proper to the Father to be unbegotten it follows that it is proper to Him also to be unproceeding.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (De Trin. iv): "One is from one --that is, the Begotten is from the Unbegotten--namely, by the property in each one respectively of innascibility and origin."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As in creatures there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> a first and a secondary principle, so also in the divine Persons, in Whom there is no before or after, is formed the principle not from a principle, Who is the Father; and the principle from a principle, Who is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.

<p>Now in things <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> a first principle is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in two ways; in one way as the first "principle," by reason of its having a relation to what proceeds from itself; in another way, inasmuch as it is a "first" principle by reason of its not being from another. Thus therefore the Father is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> both by paternity and by common spiration, as regards the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> proceeding from Himself. But as the principle, not from a principle He is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the fact that He is not from another; and this belongs to the property of innascibility, signified by this word "unbegotten."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Some there are who say that innascibility, signified by the word "unbegotten," as a property of the Father, is not a negative term only, but either that it means both these things together--namely, that the Father is from no one, and that He is the principle of others; or that it imports universal authority, or also His plenitude as the source of all. This, however, does not seem <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, because thus innascibility would not be a property distinct from paternity and spiration; but would include them as the proper is included in the common. For source and authority signify in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> nothing but the principle of origin. We must therefore say with <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. v, 7) that "unbegotten" imports the negation of passive generation. For he says that "unbegotten" has the same meaning as "not a son." Nor does it follow that "unbegotten" is not the proper notion of the Father; for primary and simple things are notified by negations; as, for instance, a point is defined as what has no part.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> "Unbegotten" is taken sometimes in a negative sense only, and in that sense <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says that "the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is unbegotten," that is, He is not begotten. Otherwise "unbegotten" may be taken in a kind of privation sense, but not as implying any imperfection. For privation can be taken in many ways; in one way when a thing has not what is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> belongs to another, even though it is not of its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to have it; as, for instance, if a stone be called a dead thing, as wanting life, which <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> belongs to some other things. In another sense, privation is so called when something has not what <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> belongs to some members of its genus; as for instance when a mole is called blind. In a third sense privation means the absence of what something ought to have; in which sense, privation imports an imperfection. In this sense, "unbegotten" is not attributed to the Father as a privation, but it may be so attributed in the second sense, meaning that a certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not begotten, while some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is begotten. In this sense the term "unbegotten" can be applied also to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Hence to consider it as a term proper to the Father alone, it must be further understood that the name "unbegotten" belongs to a divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> as the principle of another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; so that it be understood to imply negation in the genus of principle taken personally in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Or that there be understood in the term "unbegotten" that He is not in any way derived from another; and not only that He is not from another by way only of generation. In this sense the term "unbegotten" does not belong at all to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, Who is from another by procession, as a subsisting <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; nor does it belong to the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, of which it may be said that it is in the Son or in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> from another--namely, from the Father.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. ii, 9), "unbegotten" in one sense signifies the same as "uncreated"; and thus it applies to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, for thereby does the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> differ from the uncreated. In another sense it signifies what is not begotten, and in this sense it is a relative term; just as negation is reduced to the genus of affirmation, as "not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" is reduced to the genus of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, and "not white" to the genus of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>. Hence, since "begotten" implies relation in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, "unbegotten" belongs also to relation. Thus it does not follow that the Father unbegotten is substantially distinguished from the Son begotten; but only by relation; that is, as the relation of Son is denied of the Father.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> In every genus there must be something first; so in the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> there must be some one principle which is not from another, and which we call "unbegotten." To admit two innascibles is to suppose the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of two Gods, and two divine natures. Hence <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (De Synod.): "As there is one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so there cannot be two innascibles." And this especially because, did two innascibles <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, one would not be from the other, and they would not be distinguished by relative opposition: therefore they would be distinguished from each other by diversity of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The property of the Father, whereby He is not from another, is more clearly signified by the removal of the nativity of the Son, than by the removal of the procession of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; both because the procession of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> has no special name, as stated above (27, 4, ad 3), and because also in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> it presupposes the generation of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. Hence, it being denied of the Father that He is begotten, although He is the principle of generation, it follows, as a consequence, that He does not proceed by the procession of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is not the principle of generation, but proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> begotten.
