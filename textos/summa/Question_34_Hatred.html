<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether it is possible for anyone to hate God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that "the first <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and beautiful is an object of love and dilection to all." But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and beauty itself. Therefore He is <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> by none.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in the Apocryphal books of 3 Esdras 4:36,[39] it is written that "all things call upon <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> . . . and (all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>) do well like of her works." Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> according to <a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John 14:6</a>. Therefore all love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and none can <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> Him.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is a kind of aversion. But according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. i) <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> draws all things to Himself. Therefore none can <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> Him.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa073.htm#verse23">Psalm 73:23</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of them that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> Thee ascendeth continually," and (<a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse24">John 15:24</a>): "But now they have both seen and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> both Me and My Father."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As shown above (I-II, 29, 1), <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is a movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, which power is not set in motion save by something apprehended. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can be apprehended by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in two ways; first, in Himself, as when He is seen in His Essence; secondly, in His effects, when, to wit, "the invisible things" of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> . . . "are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made" (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse20">Romans 1:20</a>). Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His Essence is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> itself, which no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>--for it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to be loved. Hence it is impossible for one who sees <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His Essence, to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> Him.

<p>Moreover some of His effects are such that they can nowise be contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will, since "to be, to live, to understand," which are effects of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are desirable and lovable to all. Wherefore again <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be an object of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> if we consider Him as the Author of such like effects. Some of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> effects, however, are contrary to an inordinate will, such as the infliction of punishment, and the prohibition of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by the Divine Law. Such like effects are repugnant to a will debased by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and as regards the consideration of them, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may be an object of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> to some, in so far as they look upon Him as forbidding <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and inflicting punishment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of those who see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> Essence, which is the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in so far as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is apprehended as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of such effects as are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> beloved of all, among which are the works of Truth who reveals herself to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> draws all things to Himself, in so far as He is the source of being, since all things, in as much as they are, tend to be like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is Being itself.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether hatred of God is the greatest of sins?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the greatest of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For the most grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, since it cannot be forgiven, according to <a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse32">Matthew 12:32</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not reckoned among the various kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as may be seen from what has been said above (Question 14, Article 2). Therefore <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the most grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> consists in withdrawing oneself from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now an unbeliever who has not even <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> seems to be further away from Him than a believer, who though he <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nevertheless <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Him. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of unbelief is graver than the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is an object of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, only by reason of those of His effects that are contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: the chief of which is punishment. But <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of punishment is not the most grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the most grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The best is opposite to the worst, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. viii, 10). But <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is contrary to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, wherein <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> best consists. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> worst <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The defect in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> consists in its aversion from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated above (Question 10, Article 3): and this aversion would not have the character of guilt, were it not <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of guilt consists in a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> aversion from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>Now this <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> aversion from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is directly implied in the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but in other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, by participation and indirectly. For just as the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> cleaves directly to what it loves, so does it directly shun what it <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a>. Hence when a man <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, his <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is directly averted from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whereas in other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, fornication for instance, a man turns away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not directly, but indirectly, in so far, namely, as he desires an inordinate pleasure, to which aversion from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is connected. Now that which is so by itself, always takes precedence of that which is so by another. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is more grievous than other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxv, 11), "it is one thing not to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, end another to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the giver of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, even as it is one thing to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> indeliberately, and another to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> deliberately." This implies that to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the giver of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, is to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> deliberately, and this is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Hence it is evident that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is chiefly a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, in so far as the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> denotes a special kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and yet it is not reckoned among the kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, because it is universally found in every kind of that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Even unbelief is not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> unless it be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>: wherefore the more <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> it is, the more it is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. Now it becomes <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> by the fact that a man <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that is proposed to him. Wherefore it is evident that unbelief derives its sinfulness from <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Whose <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and hence just as a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is greater than its effect, so <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than unbelief.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Not everyone who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his punishment, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the author of punishments. For many <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the punishments inflicted on them, and yet they bear them patiently out of reverence for the Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. x) that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> commands us to bear with penal <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, not to love them. On the other hand, to break out into <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> when He inflicts those punishments, is to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> very <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and that is a most grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxv, 11): "Even as sometimes it is more grievous to love <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than to do it, so is it more <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> than, not to have done it."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether hatred of one's neighbor is always a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of one's neighbor is not always a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is commanded or counselled by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse8">Proverbs 8:8</a>: "All My words are <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, there is nothing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> nor perverse in them." Now, it is written (<a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse26">Luke 14:26</a>): "If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> come to Me, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> not his father and mother . . . he cannot be My disciple." Therefore <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of one's neighbor is not always a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, nothing wherein we imitate <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But it is in imitation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that we <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> certain people: for it is written (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse30">Romans 1:30</a>): "Detractors, hateful to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore it is possible to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> certain people without committing a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, nothing that is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a "wandering away from what is according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>," according to <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. ii, 4,30; iv, 20). Now it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to a thing to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> whatever is contrary to it, and to aim at its undoing. Therefore it seems that it is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> one's I enemy.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse9">1 John 2:9</a>): "He that . . . hateth his brother, is in darkness." Now <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> darkness is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore there cannot be <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of one's neighbor without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Hatred is opposed to love, as stated above (I-II, 29, 2); so that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of a thing is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> according as the love of that thing is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now love is due to our neighbor in respect of what he holds from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, i.e. in respect of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but not in respect of what he has of himself and from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, i.e. in respect of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and lack of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p>Consequently it is lawful to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in one's brother, and whatever pertains to the defect of Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but we cannot <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> our brother's <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now it is part of our love for our brother that we <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the fault and the lack of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in him, since desire for another's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is equivalent to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of one's brother, if we consider it simply, is always <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> By the commandment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse12">Exodus 20:12</a>) we must <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> our parents--as united to us in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and kinship. But we must <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> them in so far as they <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> an obstacle to our attaining the perfection of Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is in the detractor, not his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: so that we can <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> detractors without committing a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Men are not opposed to us in respect of the goods which they have received from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: wherefore, in this respect, we should love them. But they are opposed to us, in so far as they show hostility towards us, and this is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> in them. On this respect we should <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> them, for we should <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> in them the fact that they are hostile to us.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether hatred of our neighbor is the most grievous sin against our neighbor?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of our neighbor is the most grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against our neighbor. For it is written (<a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse15">1 John 3:15</a>): "Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer." Now <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> is the most grievous of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against our neighbor. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is also.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, worst is opposed to best. Now the best thing we give our neighbor is love, since all other things are referable to love. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is the worst.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A thing is said to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, because it hurts, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> observes (Enchiridion xii). Now there are <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by which a man hurts his neighbor more than by <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, e.g. <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>, <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> and <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is not the most grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>Moreover, <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> [Hom. x in the Opus Imperfectum, <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>] <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse19">Matthew 5:19</a>, "He that shall break one of these least commandments," says: "The commandments of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, count for little in their reward, but they count for much if they be disobeyed. On the other hand the commandments of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> such as, Thou shalt not be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, Thou shalt not desire, are reckoned great in their reward, but little in the transgression." Now <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is an internal movement like <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and desire. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of one's brother is a less grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">Sins</a> committed against our neighbor are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> on two counts; first by reason of the disorder in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, secondly by reason of the hurt inflicted on the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against. On the first count, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than external actions that hurt our neighbor, because <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is a disorder of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will, which is the chief part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and wherein is the root of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so that if a man's outward actions were to be inordinate, without any disorder in his will, they would not be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, for instance, if he were to kill a man, through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or out of zeal for <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: and if there be anything <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> in a man's outward <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against his neighbor, it is all to be traced to his inward <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>.

<p>On the other hand, as regards the hurt inflicted on his neighbor, a man's outward <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are worse than his inward <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether hatred is a capital sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is a capital <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is directly opposed to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is the foremost among the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and the mother of all others. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is the chief of the capital <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and the origin of all others.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> arise in us on account of the inclinations of our <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse5">Romans 7:5</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> . . . did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death." Now all other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> seem to arise from love and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, as was shown above (I-II, 25, 1,2). Therefore <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> should be reckoned one of the capital <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is a moral <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> regards <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> more than any other passion does. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> should be reckoned a capital <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi) does not reckon <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> among the seven capital <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (I-II, 84, 3,4), a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is one from which other <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> arise most frequently. Now <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is contrary to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, in as much as he is a rational animal: and when a thing acts contrary to its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, that which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to it is corrupted little by little. Consequently it must first of all fail in that which is less in accordance with its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and last of all in that which is most in accordance with its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, since what is first in construction is last in destruction. Now that which, first and foremost, is most <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, is the love of what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and especially love of the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and of his neighbor's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, which is opposed to this love, is not the first but the last thing in the downfall of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> resulting from <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>: and therefore it is not a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated in Phys. vii, text. 18, "the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of a thing consists in its being well disposed in accordance with its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." Hence what is first and foremost in the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> must be first and foremost in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order. Hence <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is reckoned the foremost of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and for the same reason <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> cannot be first among the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Hatred of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that is contrary to one's <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, is the first of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, even as love of one's <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is. But <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of one's connatural <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> cannot be first, but is something last, because such like <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of an already corrupted <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, even as love of an extraneous <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">Evil</a> is twofold. One is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, for the reason that it is incompatible with one's <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of such an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> may have priority over the other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. There is, however, another which is not a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but an apparent <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, which, namely, is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and connatural <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and yet is reckoned <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> on account of the corruption of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of such an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> must needs come last. This <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is vicious, but the former is not.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether hatred arises from envy?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> does not arise from <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is sorrow for another's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> does not arise from sorrow, for, on the contrary, we grieve for the presence of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> we <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> does not arise from <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is opposed to love. Now love of our neighbor is referred to our love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated above (25, 1; 26, 2). Therefore <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of our neighbor is referred to our <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not arise from <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, for we do not <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> those who are very far removed from us, but rather those who seem to be near us, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Rhet. ii). Therefore <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> does not arise from <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to one effect there is one <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in his Rule that "<a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> grows into <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> does not arise from <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxi, 45) that "out of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> cometh <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>), <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of his neighbor is a man's last step in the path of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because it is opposed to the love which he <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> has for his neighbor. Now if a man declines from that which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, it is because he intends to avoid that which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> an object to be shunned. Now every animal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> avoids sorrow, just as it desires pleasure, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. vii, x). Accordingly just as love arises from pleasure, so does <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> arise from sorrow. For just as we are moved to love whatever gives us pleasure, in as much as for that very reason it assumes the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; so we are moved to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> whatever displeases us, in so far as for this very reason it assumes the aspect of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Wherefore, since <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is sorrow for our neighbor's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it follows that our neighbor's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> becomes hateful to us, so that "out of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> cometh <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Since the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, like the apprehensive power, reflects on its own acts, it follows that there is a kind of circular movement in the actions of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power. And so according to the first forward course of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> movement, love gives rise to desire, whence follows pleasure when one has obtained what one desired. And since the very fact of taking pleasure in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> one loves is a kind of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it follows that pleasure <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> love. And in the same way sorrow <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Love and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> are <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> different, for the object of love is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which flows from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to creatures, wherefore love is due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the first place, and to our neighbor afterwards. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, which has no place in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, but only in His effects, for which reason it has been stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not an object of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, except in so far as He is considered in relation to His effects, and consequently <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is directed to our neighbor before being directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore, since <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> of our neighbor is the mother of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of our neighbor, it becomes, in consequence, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Nothing prevents a thing arising from various <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> in various respects, and accordingly <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> may arise both from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and from <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>. However it arises more directly from <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, which looks upon the very <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of our neighbor as displeasing and therefore hateful, whereas <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> arises from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> by way of increase. For at first, through <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, we desire our neighbor's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> according to a certain measure, that is in so far as that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> has the aspect of vengeance: but afterwards, through the continuance of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> goes so far as absolutely to desire his neighbor's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, which desire is part of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. Wherefore it is evident that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> formally as regards the aspect of the object, but dispositively by <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.
