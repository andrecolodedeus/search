<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether every pleasure is evil?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that every pleasure is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For that which destroys <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and hinders the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, seems to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in itself: since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is to be "in accord with reason," as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv). But pleasure destroys <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and hinders the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>; and so much the more, as the pleasure is greater: wherefore "in sexual pleasures," which are the greatest of all, "it is impossible to understand anything," as stated in Ethic. vii, 11. Moreover, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says in his commentary on Matthew [<a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, Hom. vi in Num.] that "at the time of conjugal intercourse, the presence of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is not vouchsafed, even if it be a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> that fulfils the conjugal <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>." Therefore pleasure is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in itself; and consequently every pleasure is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shuns, and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> lacking in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> seeks, seems to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in itself, and should be avoided; because, as stated in Ethic. x, 5 "the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is a kind of measure and rule of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions"; and the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse15">1 Corinthians 2:15</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> judgeth all things." But children and dumb animals, in whom there is no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, seek pleasure: whereas the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who is master of himself does not. Therefore pleasures are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in themselves and should be avoided.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and art are concerned about the difficult and the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" (Ethic. ii, 3). But no art is ordained to pleasure. Therefore pleasure is not something <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa036.htm#verse4">Psalm 36:4</a>): "Delight in the Lord." Since, therefore, Divine authority leads to no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, it seems that not every pleasure is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated in Ethic. x, 2,[3]. some have maintained that all pleasure is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. The reason seems to have been that they took account only of sensible and bodily pleasures which are more manifest; since, also in other respects, the ancient <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> did not discriminate between the intelligible and the sensible, nor between <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and sense (De Anima iii, 3). And they held that all bodily pleasures should be reckoned as bad, and thus that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, being prone to immoderate pleasures, arrives at the mean of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> by abstaining from pleasure. But they were wrong in holding this opinion. Because, since none can live without some sensible and bodily pleasure, if they who teach that all pleasures are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, are found in the act of taking pleasure; men will be more inclined to pleasure by following the example of their works instead of listening to the doctrine of their words: since, in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions and <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, wherein experience is of great weight, example moves more than words.

<p>We must therefore say that some pleasures are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and that some are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For pleasure is a repose of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power in some loved <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and resulting from some operation; wherefore we assign a twofold reason for this assertion. The first is in respect of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in which a man reposes with pleasure. For <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the moral order depend on agreement or disagreement with reason, as stated above (Question 18, Article 5): just as in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, a thing is said to be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, if it agrees with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and unnatural, if it disagrees. Accordingly, just as in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order there is a certain <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> repose, whereby a thing rests in that which agrees with its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, for instance, when a heavy body rests down below; and again an unnatural repose, whereby a thing rests in that which disagrees with its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as when a heavy body rests up aloft: so, in the moral order, there is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> pleasure, whereby the higher or lower <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> rests in that which is in accord with reason; and an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> pleasure, whereby the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> rests in that which is discordant from <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>The second reason can be found by considering the actions, some of which are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Now pleasures which are conjoined to actions are more akin to those actions, than desires, which precede them in point of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Wherefore, since the desires of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> actions are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil actions</a>, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; much more are the pleasures of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> actions <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and those of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil actions</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (Question 33, Article 3), it is not the pleasures which result from an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, that hinder the reason or destroy <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, but extraneous pleasures, such as the pleasures of the body. These indeed hinder the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, as stated above (Question 33, Article 3), either by contrariety of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> that rests in something repugnant to reason, which makes the pleasure morally bad; or by fettering the reason: thus in conjugal intercourse, though the pleasure be in accord with reason, yet it hinders the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, on account of the accompanying bodily change. But in this case the pleasure is not morally <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; as neither is sleep, whereby the reason is fettered, morally <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, if it be taken according to reason: for reason itself demands that the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> be interrupted at times. We must add, however, that although this fettering of the reason through the pleasure of conjugal intercourse has no moral <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, since it is neither a mortal nor a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; yet it proceeds from a kind of moral <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, namely, from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a>; because, as stated in the I, 98, 2 the case was different in the state of innocence.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The temperate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not shun all pleasures, but those that are immoderate, and contrary to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. The fact that children and dumb animals seek pleasures, does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that all pleasures are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: because they have from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, which is moved to that which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> suitable to them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Art is not concerned with all kinds of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but with the making of external things, as we shall state further on (57, 3). But actions and <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, which are within us, are more the concern of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than of art. Nevertheless there is an art of making pleasure, namely, "the art of cookery and the art of making arguments," as stated in Ethic. vii, 12.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether every pleasure is good?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that every pleasure is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Because as stated in the I, 5, 6 there are three kinds of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, the useful, and the pleasant. But everything <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and in like manner everything useful is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore also every pleasure is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which is not sought for the sake of something else, is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in itself, as stated in Ethic. i, 6,7. But pleasure is not sought for the sake of something else; for it seems absurd to ask anyone why he seeks to be pleased. Therefore pleasure is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in itself. Now that which is predicated to a thing considered in itself, is predicated thereof universally. Therefore every pleasure is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that which is desired by all, seems to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of itself: because <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is "what all things seek," as stated in Ethic. i, 1. But everyone seeks some kind of pleasure, even children and dumb animals. Therefore pleasure is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in itself: and consequently all pleasure is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/pro002.htm#verse14">Proverbs 2:14</a>): "Who are glad when they have done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and rejoice in most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> things."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> While some of the Stoics maintained that all pleasures are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, the Epicureans held that pleasure is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in itself, and that consequently all pleasures are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. They seem to have thus <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erred</a> through not discriminating between that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> simply, and that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in respect of a particular <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. That which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> simply, is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in itself. Now that which is not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in itself, may be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in respect of some <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> in two ways. In one way, because it is suitable to him by reason of a disposition in which he is now, which disposition, however, is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>: thus it is sometimes <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> to eat things that are poisonous, which are not suitable simply to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> temperament. In another way, through something unsuitable being esteemed suitable. And since pleasure is the repose of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> in some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, if the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> reposes in that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> simply, the pleasure will be pleasure simply, and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> simply. But if a man's <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> repose in that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, not simply, but in respect of that particular <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, then his pleasure will not be pleasure simply, but a pleasure to him; neither will it be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> simply, but in a certain respect, or an apparent <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> and the useful depend on accordance with reason, and consequently nothing is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> or useful, without being <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But the pleasant depends on agreement with the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, which tends sometimes to that which is discordant from <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Consequently not every object of pleasure is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in the moral order which depends on the order of reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The reason why pleasure is not sought for the sake of something else is because it is repose in the end. Now the end may be either <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; although nothing can be an end except in so far as it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in respect of such and such a man: and so too with regard to pleasure.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> All things seek pleasure in the same way as they seek <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: since pleasure is the repose of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But, just as it happens that not every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is desired, is of itself and verily <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; so not every pleasure is of itself and verily <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether any pleasure is the greatest good?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that no pleasure is the greatest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Because nothing generated is the greatest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: since generation cannot be the last end. But pleasure is a consequence of generation: for the fact that a thing takes pleasure is due to its being established in its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as stated above (Question 31, Article 1). Therefore no pleasure is the greatest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which is the greatest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> cannot be made better by addition. But pleasure is made better by addition; since pleasure together with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is better than pleasure without <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore pleasure is not the greatest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that which is the greatest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is universally <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as being <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of itself: since that which is such of itself is prior to and greater than that which is such <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>. But pleasure is not universally <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Therefore pleasure is not the greatest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Happiness is the greatest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: since it is the end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> life. But Happiness is not without pleasure: for it is written (<a href="../bible/psa015.htm#verse11">Psalm 15:11</a>): "Thou shalt fill me with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> with Thy countenance; at Thy right hand are delights even to the end."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> held neither with the Stoics, who asserted that all pleasures are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, nor with the Epicureans, who maintained that all pleasures are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; but he said that some are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; yet, so that no pleasure be the sovereign or greatest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But, judging from his arguments, he fails in two points. First, because, from observing that sensible and bodily pleasure consists in a certain movement and "becoming," as is evident in satiety from eating and the like; he concluded that all pleasure arises from some "becoming" and movement: and from this, since "becoming" and movement are the acts of something imperfect, it would follow that pleasure is not of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of ultimate perfection. But this is seen to be evidently <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> as regards <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> pleasures: because one takes pleasure, not only in the "becoming" of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, for instance, when one learns or wonders, as stated above (32, 8, ad 2); but also in the act of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, by making use of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> already acquired.

<p>Secondly, because by greatest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> he understood that which is the <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a> simply, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> apart from, and unparticipated by, all else, in which sense <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the Supreme Good; whereas we are speaking of the greatest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> things. Now the greatest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of everything is its last end. And the end, as stated above (1, 8; 2, 7) is twofold; namely, the thing itself, and the use of that thing; thus the miser's end is either money or the possession of money. Accordingly, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> last end may be said to be either <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who is the Supreme Good simply; or the enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which implies a certain pleasure in the last end. And in this sense a certain pleasure of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may be said to be the greatest among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> goods.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Not every pleasure arises from a "becoming"; for some pleasures result from perfect operations, as stated above. Accordingly nothing prevents some pleasure being the greatest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, although every pleasure is not such.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the greatest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> simply, by participation of which all things are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; wherefore no addition can make it better: whereas in regard to other goods, it is universally <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that any <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> becomes better by the addition of another <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Moreover it might be said that pleasure is not something extraneous to the operation of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but that it accompanies it, as stated in Ethic. i, 8.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> That pleasure is the greatest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is due not to the mere fact that it is pleasure, but to the fact that it is perfect repose in the perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Hence it does not follow that every pleasure is supremely <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, or even <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> at all. Thus a certain science is supremely <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but not every science is.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether pleasure is the measure or rule by which to judge of moral good or evil?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that pleasure is not the measure or rule of moral <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Because "that which is first in a genus is the measure of all the rest" (Metaph. x, 1). But pleasure is not the first thing in the moral genus, for it is preceded by love and desire. Therefore it is not the rule of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> in moral matters.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a measure or rule should be uniform; hence that movement which is the most uniform, is the measure and rule of all movements (Metaph. x, 1). But pleasures are various and multiform: since some of them are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore pleasure is not the measure and rule of morals.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, judgment of the effect from its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is more <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> than judgment of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> from effect. Now <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of operation is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of pleasure: because "those pleasures are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which result from <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> operations, and those are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which arise from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> operations," as stated in Ethic. x, 5. Therefore pleasures are not the rule and measure of moral <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, commenting on <a href="../bible/psa007.htm#verse10">Psalm 7:10</a> "The searcher of hearts and reins is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," says: "The end of care and thought is the pleasure which each one aims at achieving." And the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 11) that "pleasure is the architect," i.e. the principal, "end [<a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> took "finis" as being the nominative, whereas it is the genitive--<em>tou telous</em>; and the Greek reads "He" (i.e. the political philosopher), "is the architect of the end."], in regard to which, we say absolutely that this is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and that, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Moral <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> depends chiefly on the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as stated above (Question 20, Article 1); and it is chiefly from the end that we discern whether the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Now the end is taken to be that in which the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> reposes: and the repose of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and of every <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is pleasure. And therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is reckoned to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or bad chiefly according to the pleasure of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will; since that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, who takes pleasure in the works of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, who takes pleasure in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> works.

<p>On the other hand, pleasures of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> are not the rule of moral <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>; since food is universally pleasurable to the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> both of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men. But the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> takes pleasure in them in accordance with reason, to which the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> gives no heed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Love and desire precede pleasure in the order of generation. But pleasure precedes them in the order of the end, which serves a principle in actions; and it is by the principle, which is the rule and measure of such matters, that we form our judgment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> All pleasures are uniform in the point of their being the repose of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> in something <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: and in this respect pleasure can be a rule or measure. Because that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, whose will rests in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: and that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, whose will rests in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Since pleasure perfects operation as its end, as stated above (Question 33, Article 4); an operation cannot be perfectly <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, unless there be also pleasure in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: because the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of a thing depends on its end. And thus, in a way, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the pleasure is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> in the operation.
