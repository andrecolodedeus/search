<h1>Question 34. The perfection of the child conceived</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/4034.htm#article1"> Was Christ sanctified by grace in the first instant of His conception?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4034.htm#article2"> In that same instant, did He have the use of free-will?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4034.htm#article3"> In that same instant, could He merit?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4034.htm#article4"> In that same instant, was He a perfect comprehensor?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether Christ was sanctified in the first instant of His conception?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not sanctified in the first instant of His conception. For it is written (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse46">1 Corinthians 15:46</a>): "That was not first which is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, but that which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>: afterwards that which is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>." But sanctification by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is something <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> received the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of sanctification, not at the very beginning of His conception, but after a space of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, sanctification seems to be a cleansing from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: according to <a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse1">1 Corinthians 6:1</a>: "And such some of you were," namely, sinners, "but you are washed, but you are sanctified." But <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was never in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore it was not becoming that He should be sanctified by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> "all things were made," so from the Word <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a> all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who are made <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> receive <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, according to <a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse11">Hebrews 2:11</a>: "Both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one." But "the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, by whom all things were made, was not Himself made"; as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. i). Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by whom all are made <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, was not Himself made <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse35">Luke 1:35</a>): "The Holy which shall be born of thee shall be called the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>"; and (<a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse36">John 10:36</a>): "Whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (7, 9,10,12), the abundance of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> sanctifying Christ's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> flows from the very union of the Word, according to <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John 1:14</a>: "We saw His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> . . . as it were of the Only-Begotten of the Father, full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." For it has been shown above (33, 2,3) that in the first instant of conception, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was both animated and assumed by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>. Consequently, in the first instant of His conception, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had the fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> sanctifying His body and His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The order set down by the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> in this passage refers to those who by advancing attain to the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> state. But the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> is considered as a condescension of the fulness of the Godhead into <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> rather than as the promotion of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, already <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a>, as it were, to the Godhead. Therefore in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was perfection of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life from the very beginning.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> To be sanctified is to be made <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>. Now something is made not only from its contrary, but also from that which is opposite to it, either by negation or by privation: thus white is made either from black or from not-white. We indeed from being sinners are made <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>: so that our sanctification is a cleansing from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Whereas <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, was made <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, because He was not always thus sanctified by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: yet He was not made <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> from being a sinner, because He never <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>; but He was made <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> from not-holy as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, not indeed by privation, as though He were at some time a man and not <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>; but by negation--that is, when He was not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> He had not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> sanctity. Therefore at the same time He was made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For this reason the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> said (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse35">Luke 1:35</a>): "The Holy which shall be born of thee." Which words <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> expounds as follows (Moral. xviii): "In order to show the distinction between His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and ours, it is declared that He shall be born <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>. For we, though we are made <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, yet are not born <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, because by the mere <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of a corruptible <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> we are tied . . . But He alone is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> born <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> who . . . was not conceived by the combining of carnal union."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The Father creates things through the Son, and the whole <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> sanctifies men through the Man Christ, but not in the same way. For the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> has the same power and operation as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father: hence the Father does not work through the Son as an instrument, which is both mover and moved. Whereas the humanity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is as the instrument of the Godhead, as stated above (7, 1, ad 3; 8, 1, ad 1). Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> humanity is both sanctified and sanctifier.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether Christ as man had the use of free-will in the first instant of His conception?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had not the use of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> in the first instant of His conception. For a thing is, before it acts or operates. Now the use of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is an operation. Since, therefore, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> began to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the first instant of His conception, as was made clear above (Question 33, Article 2), it seems impossible that He should have the use of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> in the first instant of His conception.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the use of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> consists in choice. But choice presupposes the deliberation of counsel: for the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii) that choice is "the desire of what has been previously the object of deliberation." Therefore it seems impossible that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should have had the use of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> in the first instant of His conception.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is "a faculty of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and reason," as stated in I, 83, 2, Objection 2: consequently the use of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and the reason or <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. But the act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> presupposes an act of the senses; and this cannot <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> without proper disposition of the organs--a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> which would seem impossible in the first instant of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> conception. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> could not have the use of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> at the first instant of His conception.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in his book on the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> (<a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>: Regist. ix, Ep. 61): "As soon as the Word entered the womb, while retaining the reality of His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, He was made flesh, and a perfect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." But a perfect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has the use of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had the use of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> in the first instant of His conception.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> perfection was becoming to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> took, which perfection He attained not by making progress, but by receiving it from the very first. Now ultimate perfection does not consist in power or <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, but in operation; wherefore it is said (De Anima ii, text. 5) that operation is a "second act." We must, therefore, say that in the first instant of His conception <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had that operation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which can be had in an instant. And such is the operation of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, in which the use of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> consists. For the operation of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is sudden and instantaneous, much more, indeed, than corporeal vision; inasmuch as to understand, to will, and to feel, are not movements that may be described as "acts of an imperfect being," which attains perfection successively, but are "the acts of an already perfect being," as is said, De Anima iii, text. 28. We must therefore say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had the use of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> in the first instant of His conception.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">Existence</a> precedes action by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but not in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>; but at the same time the agent has perfect <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and begins to act unless it is hindered. Thus fire, as soon as it is generated, begins to give heat and light. The action of heating, however, is not terminated in an instant, but continues for a time; whereas the action of giving light is perfected in an instant. And such an operation is the use of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As soon as counsel or deliberation is ended, there may be choice. But those who need the deliberation of counsel, as soon as this comes to an end are certain of what ought to be chosen: and consequently they choose at once. From this it is clear that the deliberation of counsel does not of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> precede choice save for the purpose of inquiring into what is uncertain. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in the first instant of His conception, had the fulness of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, and in like manner the fulness of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; according to <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John 1:14</a>: "Full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." Wherefore, as being possessed of <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> about all things, He could choose at once in an instant.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, in regard to His infused <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, could understand without turning to phantasms, as stated above (Question 11, Article 2). Consequently His <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will could act without any action of the senses.

<p>Nevertheless it was possible for Him, in the first instant of His conception, to have an operation of the senses: especially as to the sense of touch, which the infant can exercise in the womb even before it has received the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as is said, De Gener. Animal. ii, 3,4. Wherefore, since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the first instant of His conception, through His body being already fashioned and endowed with sensible organs, much more was it possible for Him to exercise the sense of touch in that same instant.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether Christ could merit in the first instant of His conception?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> could not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> in the first instant of His conception. For the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> bears the same relation to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> as to demerit. But the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> could not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the first instant of his creation, as was shown in I, 63, 5. Therefore neither could <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> in the first instant of its creation--that is, in the first instant of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> conception.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has in the first instant of his conception seems to be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to him: for it is in this that his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> generation is terminated. But we do not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> by what is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to us, as is clear from what has been said in I-II, 109, 5; I-II, 114, 2. Therefore it seems that the use of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had in the first instant of His conception, was not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that which a man has once <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> he makes, in a way, his own: consequently it seems that he cannot <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> the same thing again: for no one <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> what is already his. If, therefore, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> in the first instant of His conception, it follows that afterwards He <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> nothing. But this is evidently <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> in the first instant of His conception.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [Paterius, Expos. Vet. et Nov. Test. super Ex. 40] says: "Increase of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> was absolutely impossible to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." But increase of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> would have been possible had He not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> in the first instant of His conception. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> in the first instant of His conception.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was sanctified by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in the first instant of His conception. Now, sanctification is twofold: that of adults who are sanctified in consideration of their own act; and that of infants who are sanctified in consideration of, not their own act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but that of their parents or of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The former sanctification is more perfect than the latter: just as act is more perfect than <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>; and "that which is by itself, than that which is by another" [Aristotle, Phys. viii]. Since, therefore, the sanctification of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was most perfect, because He was so sanctified that He might sanctify others; consequently He was sanctified by reason of His own movement of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Which movement, indeed, of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>. Consequently, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> in the first instant of His conception.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Free-will does not bear the same relation to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: for to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> it is related of itself, and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>; whereas to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> it is related as to a defect, and beside <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Coelo ii, text. 18): "That which is beside <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is subsequent to that which is according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; because that which is beside <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is an exception to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> of a creature can be moved to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> meritoriously in the first instant of its creation, but not to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> sinfully; provided, however, its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> be unimpaired.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> That which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has at the first moment of his creation, in the ordinary course of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to him. but nothing hinders a creature from receiving from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> at the very beginning of its creation. In this way did <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the first instant of its creation receive <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> by which it could <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. And for this reason is that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, by way of a certain likeness, said to be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to this Man, as explained by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Enchiridion xl).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Nothing prevents the same thing belonging to someone from several <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. And thus it is that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was able by subsequent actions and sufferings to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, which He also <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> in the first instant of His conception: not, indeed, so that it became thereby more due to Him than before, but so that it was due to Him from more <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> than before.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether Christ was a perfect comprehensor in the first instant of His conception?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not a perfect comprehensor in the first instant of His conception. For <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> precedes reward, as fault precedes punishment. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> in the first instant of His conception, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). Since, therefore, the state of comprehension is the principal reward, it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not a comprehensor in the first instant of His conception.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse26">Luke 24:26</a>): "Ought not <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to have suffered these things, and so to enter into His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>?" But <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> belongs to the state of comprehension. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not in the state of comprehension in the first instant of His conception, when as yet He had not suffered.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, what befits neither <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> nor <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> seems proper to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and therefore is not becoming to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But to be always in the state of beatitude befits neither <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> nor <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>: for if they had been <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in beatitude, they would not have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> afterwards. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, was not in the state of beatitude in the first instant of His conception.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa064.htm#verse5">Psalm 64:5</a>): "Blessed is he whom Thou hast chosen, end taken to Thee"; which words, according to the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a>, refer to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which "was taken by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> unto the unity of Person." But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was taken by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> in the first instant of His conception. Therefore, in the first instant of His conception, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, was in the state of beatitude; which is to be a comprehensor.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As appears from what was said above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), it was unbecoming that in His conception <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should receive merely <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> without the act. Now, He received <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> "not by measure" (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse34">John 3:34</a>), as stated above (Question 7, Article 11). But the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the "wayfarer," being short of that of the "comprehensor," is in less measure than that of the comprehensor. Wherefore it is manifest that in the first instant of His conception <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> received not only as much <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> as comprehensors have, but also greater than that which they all have. And because that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was not without its act, it follows that He was a comprehensor in act, seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His Essence more clearly than other creatures.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (Question 19, Article 3), <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in respect of which He is said to have been a comprehensor, but the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the body, to which He came through His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. Wherefore the reply to the Second Objection is clear.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, He had, even in His humanity, something more than other creatures--namely, that He was in the state of beatitude from the very beginning.
