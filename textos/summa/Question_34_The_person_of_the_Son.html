<h1>Question 34. The person of the Son</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1034.htm#article1"> Is Word an essential term in God, or a personal term?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1034.htm#article2"> Is it the proper name of the Son?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1034.htm#article3"> Is relation to creatures expressed in the name of the Word?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether Word in God is a personal name?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that Word in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not a personal name. For personal names are applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a proper sense, as Father and Son. But Word is applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> metaphorically, as <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> says on (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John 1:1</a>), "In the beginning was the Word." Therefore Word is not a personal name in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. ix, 10), "The Word is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> with love;" and according to <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm</a> (Monol. lx), "To speak is to the Supreme Spirit nothing but to see by thought." But <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and thought, and sight, are <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> terms in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore Word is not a personal term in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to word to be spoken. But, according to <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm</a> (Monol. lix), as the Father is <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a>, so the Father speaks, the Son speaks, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> speaks; and likewise, each one of them is spoken. Therefore, the name Word is used as an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> term in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not in a personal sense.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, no divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is made. But the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is something made. For it is said, "Fire, hail, snow, ice, the storms which do His Word" (<a href="../bible/psa148.htm#verse8">Psalm 148:8</a>). Therefore the Word is not a personal name in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. vii, 11): "As the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is related to the Father, so also is the Word to Him Whose Word He is." But the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is a personal name, since it is said relatively. Therefore so also is Word.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The name of Word in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if taken in its proper sense, is a personal name, and in no way an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> name.

<p>To see how this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, we must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that our own word taken in its proper sense has a threefold meaning; while in a fourth sense it is taken improperly or figuratively. The clearest and most <a href="../cathen/04167a.htm">common sense</a> is when it is said of the word spoken by the voice; and this proceeds from an interior source as regards two things found in the exterior word--that is, the vocal sound itself, and the signification of the sound. For, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Peri Herm. i) vocal sound signifies the concept of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Again the vocal sound proceeds from the signification or the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, as stated in De Anima ii, text 90. The vocal sound, which has no signification cannot be called a word: wherefore the exterior vocal sound is called a word from the fact the it signifies the interior concept of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. Therefore it follows that, first and chiefly, the interior concept of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is called a word; secondarily, the vocal sound itself, signifying the interior concept, is so called; and thirdly, the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> of the vocal sound is called a word. <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> mentions these three kinds of words (De Fide Orth. i, 17), saying that "word" is called "the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> movement of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, whereby it is moved, and understands, and thinks, as light and splendor;" which is the first kind. "Again," he says, "the word is what is not pronounced by a vocal word, but is uttered in the heart;" which is the third kind. "Again," also, "the word is the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>"--that is, the messenger "of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>;" which is the second kind. Word is also used in a fourth way figuratively for that which is signified or effected by a word; thus we are wont to say, "this is the word I have said," or "which the king has commanded," alluding to some <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> signified by the word either by way of assertion or of command.

<p>Now word is taken strictly in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as signifying the concept of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xv, 10): "Whoever can understand the word, not only before it is sounded, but also before thought has clothed it with <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> sound, can already see some likeness of that Word of Whom it is said: In the beginning was the Word." The concept itself of the heart has of its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to proceed from something other than itself--namely, from the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the one conceiving. Hence "Word," according as we use the term strictly of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, signifies something proceeding from another; which belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of personal terms in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, inasmuch as the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are distinguished by origin (27, 3,4,5). Hence the term "Word," according as we use the term strictly of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is to be taken as said not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, but personally.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, who sprang from <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, declared that the Son differed in <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> from the Father. Hence, they endeavored to maintain that when the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is called the Word, this is not to be understood in a strict sense; lest the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the Word proceeding should compel them to confess that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is of the same <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> as the Father. For the interior word proceeds in such a manner from the one who pronounces it, as to remain within him. But supposing Word to be said metaphorically of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we must still admit Word in its strict sense. For if a thing be called a word metaphorically, this can only be by reason of some manifestation; either it makes something manifest as a word, or it is manifested by a word. If manifested by a word, there must <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> a word whereby it is manifested. If it is called a word because it exteriorly manifests, what it exteriorly manifests cannot be called word except in as far as it signifies the interior concept of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which anyone may also manifest by exterior signs. Therefore, although Word may be sometimes said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> metaphorically, nevertheless we must also admit Word in the proper sense, and which is said personally.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Nothing belonging to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can be applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> personally, except word alone; for word alone signifies that which emanates from another. For what the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> forms in its conception is the word. Now, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> itself, according as it is made actual by the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, is considered absolutely; likewise the act of understanding which is to the actual <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> what <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is to actual being; since the act of understanding does not signify an act going out from the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> agent, but an act remaining in the agent. Therefore when we say that word is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, the term <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> does not mean the act of a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, or any one of its <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, but stands for what the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> conceives by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>. Hence also <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. vii, 1) that the Word is "begotten wisdom;" for it is nothing but the concept of the Wise One; and in the same way It can be called "begotten <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>." Thus can also be explained how "to speak" is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "to see by thought," forasmuch as the Word is conceived by the gaze of the divine thought. Still the term "thought" does not properly apply to the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xv, 16): "Therefore do we speak of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, and not of the Thought of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, lest we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is something unstable, now assuming the form of Word, now putting off that form and remaining latent and as it were formless." For thought consists properly in the search after the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and this has no place in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But when the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> attains to the form of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, it does not think, but perfectly contemplates the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm</a> (Monol. lx) takes "thought" in an improper sense for "<a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As, properly speaking, Word in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said personally, and not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, so likewise is to "speak." Hence, as the Word is not common to the Father, Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, so it is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the Father, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are one speaker. So <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. vii, 1): "He who speaks in that co-<a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Word is understood as not alone in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but as being with that very Word, without which, forsooth, He would not be speaking." On the other hand, "to be spoken" belongs to each Person, for not only is the word spoken, but also the thing understood or signified by the word. Therefore in this manner to one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> alone in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does it belong to be spoken in the same way as a word is spoken; whereas in the way whereby a thing is spoken as being understood in the word, it belongs to each Person to be spoken. For the Father, by understanding Himself, the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and all other things comprised in this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, conceives the Word; so that thus the whole <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> is "spoken" in the Word; and likewise also all creatures: as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of a man by the word he conceives in the act of understanding a stone, speaks a stone. <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm</a> took the term "speak" improperly for the act of understanding; whereas they really differ from each other; for "to understand" means only the habitude of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> agent to the thing understood, in which habitude no trace of origin is conveyed, but only a certain information of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; forasmuch as our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is made actual by the form of the thing understood. In <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, however, it means complete identity, because in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and the thing understood are altogether the same, as was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> above (14, 4,5). Whereas to "speak" means chiefly the habitude to the word conceived; for "to speak" is nothing but to utter a word. But by means of the word it imports a habitude to the thing understood which in the word uttered is manifested to the one who understands. Thus, only the Person who utters the Word is "speaker" in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, although each Person understands and is understood, and consequently is spoken by the Word.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The term "word" is there taken figuratively, as the thing signified or effected by word is called word. For thus creatures are said to do the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as executing any effect, whereto they are ordained from the word conceived of the divine wisdom; as anyone is said to do the word of the king when he does the work to which he is appointed by the king's word.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether "Word" is the Son's proper name?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that "Word" is not the proper name of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is a subsisting <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But word does not signify a subsisting thing, as appears in ourselves. Therefore word cannot be the proper name of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the word proceeds from the speaker by being uttered. Therefore if the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is properly the word, He proceeds from the Father, by way only of utterance; which is the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Valentine; as appears from <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Haeres. xi).

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every proper name of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> signifies some property of that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Therefore, if the Word is the Son's proper name, it signifies some property of His; and thus there will be several more properties in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than those above mentioned.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, whoever understands conceives a word in the act of understanding. But the Son understands. Therefore some word belongs to the Son; and consequently to be Word is not proper to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, it is said of the Son (<a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse3">Hebrews 1:3</a>): "Bearing all things by the word of His power;" whence <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a> infers (Cont. Eunom. v, 11) that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is the Son's Word. Therefore to be Word is not proper to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. vi, 11): "By Word we understand the Son alone."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> "Word," said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in its proper sense, is used personally, and is the proper name of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. For it signifies an emanation of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> Who proceeds in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by way of emanation of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, is called the Son; and this procession is called generation, as we have shown above (Question 27, Article 2). Hence it follows that the Son alone is properly called Word in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> "To be" and "to understand" are not the same in us. Hence that which in us has <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> being, does not belong to our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "to be" and "to understand" are one and the same: hence the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is not an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> in Him, or an effect of His; but belongs to His very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. And therefore it must needs be something subsistent; for whatever is in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> subsists; and so <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. i, 18) that "the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> and has a hypostatic being; but other words [as our own] are activities if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of Valentine was condemned, not as the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> pretended, because he asserted that the Son was born by being uttered, as <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> relates (De Trin. vi); but on account of the different mode of utterance proposed by its author, as appears from <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Haeres. xi).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In the term "Word" the same property is comprised as in the name Son. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. vii, 11): "Word and Son express the same." For the Son's nativity, which is His personal property, is signified by different names, which are attributed to the Son to express His perfection in various ways. To show that He is of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as the Father, He is called the Son; to show that He is co-<a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, He is called the Splendor; to show that He is altogether like, He is called the Image; to show that He is begotten immaterially, He is called the Word. All these <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> cannot be expressed by only one name.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> To be <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> belongs to the Son, in the same way as it belongs to Him to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since to understand is said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, as stated above (14, 2,4). Now the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> begotten, and not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> begetting; and hence He is <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a>, not as producing a Word, but as the Word proceeding; forasmuch as in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Word proceeding does not differ really from the divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, but is distinguished from the principle of the Word only by relation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> When it is said of the Son, "Bearing all things by the word of His power"; "word" is taken figuratively for the effect of the Word. Hence a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says that "word" is here taken to mean command; inasmuch as by the effect of the power of the Word, things are kept in being, as also by the effect of the power of the Word things are brought into being. <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a> speaks widely and figuratively in applying Word to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; in the sense perhaps that everything that makes a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> may be called his word, and so in that way the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> may be called the Son's Word, because He manifests the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the name "Word" imports relation to creatures?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the name 'Word' does not import relation to creatures. For every name that connotes some effect in creatures, is said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>. But Word is not said <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, but personally. Therefore Word does not import relation to creatures.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever imports relation to creatures is said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>; as "Lord" and "Creator." But Word is said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. Therefore it does not import relation to the creature.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, Word imports relation to the source whence it proceeds. Therefore, if it imports relation to the creature, it follows that the Word proceeds from the creature.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> (in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>) are many according to their various relations to creatures. Therefore if Word imports relation to creatures, it follows that in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is not one Word only, but many.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, if Word imports relation to the creature, this can only be because creatures are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> beings only; He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> also non-beings. Therefore in the Word are implied relations to non-beings; which appears to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. lxxxiii, qu. 63), that "the name Word signifies not only relation to the Father, but also relation to those beings which are made through the Word, by His operative power."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Word implies relation to creatures. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> Himself, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> every creature. Now the word conceived in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is representative of everything that is actually understood. Hence there are in ourselves different words for the different things which we understand. But because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by one act understands Himself and all things, His one only Word is expressive not only of the Father, but of all creatures.

<p>And as the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is only cognitive as regards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whereas as regards creatures, it is both cognitive and operative, so the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is only expressive of what is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father, but is both expressive and operative of creatures; and therefore it is said (<a href="../bible/psa032.htm#verse9">Psalm 32:9</a>): "He spake, and they were made;" because in the Word is implied the operative <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> makes.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is also included indirectly in the name of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; for <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of a rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore the name of a divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, as regards the personal relation, does not imply relation to the creature, but it is implied in what belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Yet there is nothing to prevent its implying relation to creatures, so far as the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is included in its meaning: for as it properly belongs to the Son to be the Son, so it properly belongs to Him to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> begotten, or the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a> begotten; and in this way the name Word imports relation to creatures.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Since the relations result from actions, some names import the relation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to creatures, which relation follows on the action of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> which passes into some exterior effect, as to create and to govern; and the like are applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. But others import a relation which follows from an action which does not pass into an exterior effect, but abides in the agent--as to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and to will: such are not applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>; and this kind of relation to creatures is implied in the name of the Word. Nor is it <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that all names which import the relation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to creatures are applied to Him in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>; but only those names are applied in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> which import relation following on the action of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> passing into exterior effect.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Creatures are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> not by a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> derived from the creatures themselves, but by His own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Hence it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the Word should proceed from creatures, although the Word is expressive of creatures.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The name of Idea is imposed chiefly to signify relation to creatures; and therefore it is applied in a plural sense to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and it is not said personally. But the name of Word is imposed chiefly to signify the speaker, and consequently, relation to creatures, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by understanding Himself, understands every creature; and so there is only one Word in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that is a personal one.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of non-beings and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> Word about non-beings are the same; because the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> contains no less than does the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xv, 14). Nevertheless the Word is expressive and operative of beings, but is expressive and manifestive of non-beings.
