<h1>Question 34. The sacrament of Order as to its essence and its parts</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5034.htm#article1"> Should there be Order in the Church?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5034.htm#article2"> Is it fittingly defined?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5034.htm#article3"> Is it a sacrament?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5034.htm#article4"> Is its form expressed properly?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5034.htm#article5"> Does this sacrament have any matter?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether there should be Order in the Church?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there should not be Order in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For Order requires subjection and preeminence. But subjection seemingly is incompatible with the liberty whereunto we are called by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore there should not be Order in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, he who has received an Order becomes another's superior. But in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> everyone should deem himself lower than another (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse3">Philippians 2:3</a>): "Let each esteem others better than themselves." Therefore Order should not be in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, we find order among the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> on account of their differing in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>. But all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are one in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and it is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> who has the higher <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore Order should not be in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> "Those things that are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are in order [Vulg: 'Those (powers) that are, are ordained of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.']." Now the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for He Himself built it with His blood. Therefore there ought to be Order in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>Further, the state of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is between the state of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and the state of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Now we find order in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, in that some things are above others, and likewise in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, as in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Therefore there should be Order in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wished to produce His works in likeness to Himself, as far as possible, in order that they might be perfect, and that He might be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through them. Hence, that He might be portrayed in His works, not only according to what He is in Himself, but also according as He acts on others, He laid this <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> on all things, that last things should be reduced and perfected by middle things, and middle things by the first, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. v). Wherefore that this beauty might not be lacking to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, He established Order in her so that some should deliver the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> to others, being thus made like to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in their own way, as co-operating with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; even as in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> body, some members act on others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The subjection of slavery is incompatible with liberty; for slavery consists in lording over others and employing them for one's own profit. Such subjection is not required in Order, whereby those who preside have to seek the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of their subjects and not their own profit.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Each one should esteem himself lower in <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, not in office; and orders are a kind of office.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Order among the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> does not arise from difference of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, unless <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, in so far as difference of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> results in them from difference of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But in them it results directly from their difference in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; because their orders regard their participation of divine things, and their communicating them in the state of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, which is according to the measure of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as being the end and effect, so to speak, of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. on the other hand, the Orders of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> militant regard the participation in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and the communication thereof, which are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and, in a way, precede <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; and consequently our Orders do not require <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, but only the power to dispense the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>; for which reason order does not correspond to the difference of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, but to the difference of power.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether Order is properly defined?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that order is improperly defined by the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> (Sent. iv, D, 53), where it is said "Order is a seal of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, whereby <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power is conferred on the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> ordained." For a part should not be described as the genus of the whole. Now the character which is denoted by the seal in a subsequent definition is a part of order, since it is placed in contradistinction with that which is either reality only, or sacrament only, since it is both reality and sacrament. Therefore seal should not be mentioned as the genus of Order.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as a character is imprinted in the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacrament of order</a>, so is it in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a>. Now character was not mentioned in the definition of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Therefore neither should it be mentioned in the definition of Order.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> there is also given a certain <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power to approach the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>; and again it is a seal, since it is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Therefore this definition is applicable to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>; and consequently it is improperly applied to Order.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, Order is a kind of relation, and relation is realized in both its terms. Now the terms of the relation of order are the superior and the inferior. Therefore inferiors have order as well as superiors. Yet there is no power of preeminence in them, such as is mentioned here in the definition of Order, as appears from the subsequent explanation (Sent. iv, D, 53), where promotion to power is mentioned. Therefore Order is improperly defined there.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master's</a> definition of Order applies to Order as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Hence he mentions two things, namely the outward sign, a "kind of seal," i.e. a kind of sign, and the inward effect, "whereby <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power," etc.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Seal stands here, not for the inward character, but for the outward action, which is the sign and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of inward power; and this is also the sense of character in the other definition. If, however, it be taken for the inward character, the definition would not be unsuitable; because the division of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> into those three things is not a division into integral parts, properly speaking; since what is reality only is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, and that which is the sacrament is transitory; while that which is sacrament and reality is said to remain. Wherefore it follows that inward character itself is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> and principally the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacrament of Order</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> there is conferred a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power to receive the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, for which reason it imprints a character, nevertheless this is not its principal effect, but the inward cleansing; wherefore <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> would be given even though the former motive did not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>. On the other hand, order denotes power principally. Wherefore the character which is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power is included in the definition of Order, but not in that of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> there is given a certain <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to receive, and consequently a somewhat passive <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. But power properly denotes active <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, together with some kind of preeminence. Hence this definition is not applicable to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The word "order" is used in two ways. For sometimes it denotes the relation itself, and thus it is both in the inferior and in the superior, as the objection states; but it is not thus that we use the word here. On the other hand, it denotes the degree which results in the order taken in the first sense. And since the notion of order as relation is observed where we first meet with something higher than another, it follows that this degree of pre-eminence by <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power is called Order.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether Order is a sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that Order is not a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. For a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugh of St. Victor</a> (De Sacram. i) "is a material element." Now Order denotes nothing of the kind, but rather relation or power; since Order is a part of power according to <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a>. Therefore it is not a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> do not concern the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> triumphant. Yet Order is there, as in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Therefore it is not a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> authority, which is Order, is given by means of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, so is <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular authority</a>, since kings also are anointed, as stated above (19, 3, ad 2). But the kingly power is not a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Therefore neither is order of which we speak now.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is mentioned by all among the seven <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>Further, "the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a thing being such, is still more so." Now Order is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> being the dispenser of the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Therefore Order has more reason for being a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> than the others.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (29, 1; III, 60), a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is nothing else than a sanctification conferred on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with some outward sign. Wherefore, since by receiving orders a <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> is conferred on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by visible signs, it is clear that Order is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although Order does not by its name express a material element, it is not conferred without some material element.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Power must needs be proportionate to the purpose for which it is intended. Now the communication of divine things, which is the purpose for which <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power is given, is not effected among the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> by means of sensible signs, as is the case among men. Hence the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power that is Order is not bestowed on the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> by visible signs, as on men. Wherefore Order is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> among men, but not among <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Not every <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> or <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> given to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, for both <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> are blessed, and yet such blessings are not <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and in like manner neither is the anointing of a king; because by such blessings men are not ordained to the dispensing of the divine <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, as by the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> of Order. Hence the comparison fails.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the form of this sacrament is suitably expressed?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is unsuitably set forth in the text (Sent. iv, D, 24). Because the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> take their efficacy from their form. Now the efficacy of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> is from the divine power, which works our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in them in a most hidden manner. Therefore the form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> should include a mention of the divine power by the invocation of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, as in the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to command pertains to one who has authority. Now the dispenser of the sacrament exercises no authority, but only ministry. Therefore he should not use the imperative mood by saying: "Do" or "Receive" this or that, or some similar expression.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, mention should not be made in the sacramental form, except of such things as are <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. But the use of the power received is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but is consequent upon it. Therefore it should not be mentioned in the form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> direct us to an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> reward. But the forms of the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> make no mention of a reward. Therefore neither should any mention be made thereof in the form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as in the words: "Since thou wilt have a share, if faithfully," etc.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> This sacrament consists chiefly in the power conferred. Now power is conferred by power, as like proceeds from like; and again power is made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by its use, since powers are manifested by their acts. Wherefore in the form of order the use of order is expressed by the act which is commanded; and the conferring of power is expressed by employing the imperative mood.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are not ordained chiefly to effects similar to the power whereby the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are dispensed, as this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is. Hence in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> there is a kind of universal communication. Wherefore in the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> something is expressed on the part of the divine power to which the effect of the sacrament is likened, but not in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> [There is a special reason why this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, rather than the others, is conferred by employing the imperative mood. For]* although the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who is the minister of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> has no authority in respect of the conferring of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, nevertheless he has some power with regard to the power of Order, which power he confers, in so far as it is derived, from his. [The sentence in brackets is not in the Leonine edition.]

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The use of power is the effect of power in the genus of efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and from this point of view it has no reason to be mentioned in the definition of Order. But it is somewhat a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> in the genus of final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and from this point of view it can be placed in the definition of order.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> There is here a difference between this and the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Because by this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> an office or the power to do something is conferred; and so it is fitting that mention be made of the reward to be obtained if it be administered faithfully. But in the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> no such office or power to act is conferred, and so no mention of reward is made in them. Accordingly the recipient is somewhat passive in relation to the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, because he receives them for the perfecting of his own state only, whereas in relation to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> he holds himself somewhat actively, since he receives it for the sake of exercising <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchical</a> duties in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Wherefore although the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, from the very fact that they give <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, direct the recipient to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, properly speaking they do not direct him to a reward, in the same way as this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> does.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether this sacrament has any matter?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> has no <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Because in every sacrament that has a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> the power that works in the sacrament is in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But in the material objects which are used here, such as keys, <a href="../cathen/03248a.htm">candlesticks</a>, and so forth, there is not apparently any power of sanctification. Therefore it has no <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> the fulness of sevenfold <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is conferred, as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 24), just as in Confirmation. But the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of Confirmation requires to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> beforehand. Since then the things which appear to be material in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> are not <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> beforehand, it would seem that they are not the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in any sacrament that has <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> there needs to be contact of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> with the recipient of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Now, as some say, it is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> that there be contact between the aforesaid material objects and the recipient of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but only that they be presented to him. Therefore the aforesaid material objects are not the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Every sacrament consists of things and words. Now in any sacrament the thing is the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Therefore the things employed in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> are its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p>Further, more is requisite to dispense the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> than to receive them. Yet <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, wherein the power is given to receive the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, needs a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Therefore order also does, wherein the power is given to dispense them.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> employed outwardly in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> signifies that the power which works in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> comes entirely from without. Wherefore, since the effect proper to this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, namely the character, is not received through any operation of the one who approaches the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as was the case in Penance, but comes wholly from without, it is fitting that it should have a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, yet otherwise than the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> that have <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; because that which is bestowed in the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> comes from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, and not from the minister who dispenses the sacrament; whereas that which is conferred in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, namely the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power, comes also from him who gives the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as imperfect from perfect power. Hence the efficacy of the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> resides chiefly in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> which both signifies and contains the divine power through the sanctification applied by the minister; whereas the efficacy of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> resides chiefly with him who dispenses the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is employed to show the powers conferred in particular by one who has it completely, rather than to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> power; and this is clear from the fact that the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is in keeping with the use of power.

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, on account of the power it contains; but it is not so in the case in point.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If we admit this assertion, the reason for it is clear from what we have said; for since the power of order is received from the minister and not from the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, the presenting of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is more <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the sacrament than contact therewith. However, the words themselves of the form would seem to indicate that contact with the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, for it is said: "Receive" this or that.
