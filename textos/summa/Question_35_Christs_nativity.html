<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether nativity regards the nature rather than the person?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that nativity regards the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> rather than the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [Fulgentius] says (De Fide ad Petrum): "The <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> could not be conceived and born of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, except in a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." Consequently it becomes the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> to be conceived and born by reason of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Much more, therefore, does it regard <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> itself.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. v), "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>" is so denominated from "nativity." But things are denominated from one another by reason of some likeness. Therefore it seems that nativity regards the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> rather than the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, properly speaking, that is born which begins to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> by nativity. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Person did not begin to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> by His nativity, whereas His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> did. Therefore it seems that the nativity properly regards the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and not the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii): "Nativity regards the hypostasis, not the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Nativity can be attributed to someone in two ways: first, as to its subject; secondly, as to its terminus. To him that is born it is attributed as to its subject: and this, properly speaking, is the hypostasis, not the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For since to be born is to be generated; as a thing is generated in order for it to be, so is a thing born in order for it to be. Now, to be, properly speaking, belongs to that which subsists; since a form that does not subsist is said to be only inasmuch as by it something is: and whereas <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> or hypostasis designates something as subsisting, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> designates form, whereby something subsists. Consequently, nativity is attributed to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> or hypostasis as to the proper subject of being born, but not to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p>But to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> nativity is attributed as to its terminus. For the terminus of generation and of every nativity is the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Now, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> designates something as a form: wherefore nativity is said to be "the road to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Phys. ii): for the purpose of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is terminated in the form or <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> On account of the identity of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and hypostasis in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is sometimes put instead of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> or hypostasis. And in this sense <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says that the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> was conceived and born, inasmuch as the Person of the Son was conceived and born in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> No movement or change is denominated from the subject moved, but from the terminus of the movement, whence the subject has its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. For this reason nativity is not denominated from the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> born, but from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which is the terminus of nativity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, properly speaking, does not begin to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>: rather is it the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> that begins to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in some <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Because, as stated above, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> designates that by which something is; whereas <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> designates something as having subsistent being.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether a temporal nativity should be attributed to Christ?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that temporal nativity is not to be attributed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For "to be born is a certain movement of a thing that did not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> before it was born, which movement procures for it the benefit of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>" [Cf. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, De Unit. Trin. xii]. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. Therefore He could not be born in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, what is perfect in itself needs not to be born. But the Person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was perfect from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. Therefore He needs not to be born in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Therefore it seems that He had no temporal birth.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, properly speaking, nativity regards the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. But in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there is only one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Therefore in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there is but one nativity.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, what is born by two nativities is born twice. But this proposition is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>; "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was born twice": because the nativity whereby He was born of the Father suffers no interruption; since it is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. Whereas interruption is required to warrant the use of the adverb "twice": for a man is said to run twice whose running is interrupted. Therefore it seems that we should not admit a double nativity in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii): "We confess two nativities in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: one of the Father--<a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>; and one which occurred in these latter times for our sake."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is compared to nativity, as the terminus to movement or change. Now, movement is diversified according to the diversity of its termini, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> shows (Phys. v). But, in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there is a twofold <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: one which He received of the Father from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, the other which He received from His Mother in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Therefore we must needs attribute to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> a twofold nativity: one by which He was born of the Father from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>; one by which He was born of His Mother in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This was the argument of a certain <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, Felician, and is solved thus by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Contra Felic. xii). "Let us suppose," says he, "as many maintain, that in the world there is a universal <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which, by its ineffable movement, so gives life to all seed, that it is not compounded with things begotten, but bestows life that they may be begotten. Without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, when this <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> reaches the womb, being intent on fashioning the passible <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to its own purpose, it unites itself to the personality thereof, though manifestly it is not of the same <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>; and thus of the active <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and passive <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is made out of two <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. And so we confess that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is born from out the womb; but not as though, before birth, it was nothing at all in itself. Thus, then, but in a way much more sublime, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was born as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, just as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is held to be born together with the body: not as though they both made one <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, but that from both, one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> results. Yet we do not say that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> began thus to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>: lest it be thought that His Divinity is temporal. Nor do we acknowledge the flesh of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> to have been from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>: lest it be thought that He took, not a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, but some resemblance thereof."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This was an argument of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, and it is thus solved by Cyril in an epistle [Cf. Acta Concil. Ephes., p. 1, cap. viii]: "We do not say that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> had need, for His own sake, of a second nativity, after that which is from the Father: for it is foolish and a mark of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> to say that He who is from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, and co-<a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> with the Father, needs to begin again to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>. But because for us and for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, uniting the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to His Person, He became the child of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, for this reason do we say that He was born in the flesh."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Nativity regards the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> as its subject, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as its terminus. Now, it is possible for several transformations to be in the same subject: yet must they be diversified in respect of their termini. But we do not say this as though the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> nativity were a transformation or a movement, but because it is designated by way of a transformation or movement.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> can be said to have been born twice in respect of His two nativities. For just as he is said to run twice who runs at two different times, so can He be said to be born twice who is born once from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> and once in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>: because <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> and time differ much more than two different times, although each signifies a measure of duration.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the Blessed Virgin can be called Christ's Mother in respect of His temporal nativity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> cannot be called Christ's Mother in respect of His temporal nativity. For, as stated above (Question 32, Article 4), the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin Mary</a> did not cooperate actively in begetting <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but merely supplied the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But this does not seem sufficient to make her His Mother: otherwise wood might be called the mother of the bed or bench. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> cannot be called the Mother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was born <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>. But a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> begetting does not suffice for motherhood or sonship: for we do not speak of Eve as being the daughter of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>. Therefore neither should <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> be called the Son of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, motherhood seems to imply partial separation of the semen. But, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii), "Christ's body was formed, not by a seminal process, but by the operation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> should not be called the Mother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse18">Matthew 1:18</a>): "The generation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was in this wise. When His Mother Mary was espoused to <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>," etc.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin Mary</a> is in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> the Mother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For, as we have said above (5, 2; 31, 5), <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was not brought down from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> Valentine maintained, but was taken from the Virgin Mother, and formed from her purest blood. And this is all that is required for motherhood, as has been made clear above (31, 5; 32, 4). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Mother.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (Question 32, Article 3), not every generation implies fatherhood or motherhood and sonship, but only the generation of living things. Consequently when inanimate things are made from some <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, the relationship of motherhood and sonship does not follow from this, but only in the generation of living things, which is properly called nativity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii): "The temporal nativity by which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was born for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is, in a way, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, since a Man was born of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and after the due lapse of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> from His conception: but it is also <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, because He was begotten, not of seed, but of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, above the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of conception." Thus, then, on the part of the mother, this nativity was <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, but on the part of the operation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> it was <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> Mother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (31, 5, ad 3; 32, 4), the resolution of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> semen is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for conception; neither, therefore, is it required for motherhood.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the Blessed Virgin should be called the Mother of God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> should not be called the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>. For in the Divine mysteries we should not make any assertion that is not taken from <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Scripture</a>. But we read nowhere in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Scripture</a> that she is the mother or parent of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but that she is the "mother of Christ" or of "the Child," as may be seen from <a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse18">Matthew 1:18</a>. Therefore we should not say that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> is the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in respect of His Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>. But the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> did not first originate from the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> should not be called the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the word "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" is predicated in common of Father, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. If, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> is <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> it seems to follow that she was the Mother of Father, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, which cannot be allowed. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> should not be called <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> In the chapters of Cyril, approved in the Council of Ephesus (P. 1, Cap. xxvi), we read: "If anyone confess not that the Emmanuel is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that for this reason the Holy Virgin is the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, since she begot of her flesh the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> made flesh, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 16, Article 1), every word that signifies a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in the concrete can stand for any hypostasis of that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now, since the union of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> took place in the hypostasis, as above stated (2, 3), it is manifest that this word "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" can stand for the hypostasis, having a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and a Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore whatever belongs to the Divine and to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> can be attributed to that Person: both when a word is employed to stand for it, signifying the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, and when a word is used signifying the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now, conception and birth are attributed to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and hypostasis in respect of that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in which it is conceived and born. Since, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was taken by the Divine Person in the very beginning of the conception, as stated above (Question 33, Article 3), it follows that it can be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was conceived and born of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin</a>. Now from this is a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> called a man's mother, that she conceived him and gave birth to him. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> called the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>. For the only way in which it could be denied that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> is the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> would be either if the humanity were first subject to conception and birth, before this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> were the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, as <a href="../cathen/12043a.htm">Photinus</a> said; or if the humanity were not assumed unto unity of the Person or hypostasis of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, as <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> maintained. But both of these are <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>. Therefore it is <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> to deny that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> is the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This was an argument of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, and it is solved by saying that, although we do not find it said expressly in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> is the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, yet we do find it expressly said in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> that "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," as may be seen <a href="../bible/1jo005.htm#verse20">1 John 5:20</a>, and that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> is the "Mother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>," which is clearly expressed <a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse18">Matthew 1:18</a>. Therefore, from the words of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> it follows of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> that she is the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>.

<p>Again, it is written (<a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse5">Romans 9:5</a>) that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> "according to the flesh, who is over all things, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> blessed for ever." But He is not of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> except through the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>. Therefore He who is "above all things, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> blessed for ever," is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> born of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> as of His Mother.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This was an argument of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>. But Cyril, in a letter against <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> [Cf. Acta Conc. Ephes., p. 1, cap. ii, answers it thus: "Just as when a man's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is born with its body, they are considered as one being: and if anyone wish to say that the mother of the flesh is not the mother of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, he says too much. Something like this may be perceived in the generation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> was born of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father: but because He took flesh, we must of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> confess that in the flesh He was born of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>." Consequently we must say that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> is called the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, not as though she were the Mother of the Godhead, but because she is the mother, according to His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, of the Person who has both the divine and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although the name "God" is common to the three Persons, yet sometimes it stands for the Person of the Father alone, sometimes only for the Person of the Son or of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as stated above (16, 1; I, 39, 4). So that when we say, "The <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> is the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>," this word "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" stands only for the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a> Person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether there are two filiations in Christ?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there are two filiations in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For nativity is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of filiation. But in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there are two nativities. Therefore in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there are also two filiations.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, filiation, which is said of a man as being the son of someone, his father or his mother, depends, in a way, on him: because the very being of a relation consists "in being referred to another"; wherefore if one of two relatives be destroyed, the other is destroyed also. But the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> filiation by which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> the Father depends not on His Mother, because nothing <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> depends on what is temporal. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not His Mother's Son by temporal filiation. Either, therefore, He is not her Son at all, which is in contradiction to what has been said above (3,4), or He must needs be her Son by some other temporal filiation. Therefore in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there are two filiations.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, one of two relatives enters the definition of the other; hence it is clear that of two relatives, one is specified from the other. But one and the same cannot be in diverse <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Therefore it seems impossible that one and the same relation be referred to extremes which are altogether diverse. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is said to be the Son of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">Eternal</a> Father and a temporal mother, who are terms altogether diverse. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> cannot, by the same relation, be called the Son of the Father and of His Mother Therefore in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there are two filiations.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii), things pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> are multiple in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; but not those things that pertain to the Person. But filiation belongs especially to the Person, since it is a personal property, as appears from what was said in I, 32, 3; I, 40, 2. Therefore there is but one filiation in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> opinions differ on this question. For some, considering only the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of filiation, which is nativity, put two filiations in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, just as there are two nativities.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> others, considering only the subject of filiation, which is the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> or hypostasis, put only one filiation in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, just as there is but one hypostasis or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Because the unity or plurality of a relation is considered in respect, not of its terms, but of its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> or of its subject. For if it were considered in respect of its terms, every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> have in himself two filiations--one in reference to his father, and another in reference to his mother. But if we consider the question aright, we shall see that every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> bears but one relation to both his father and his mother, on account of the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> thereof. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is born by one birth of both father and mother: whence he bears but one relation to both. The same is said of one master who teaches many <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> the same doctrine, and of one lord who governs many subjects by the same power. But if there be various <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> specifically diverse, it seems that in consequence the relations differ in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>: wherefore nothing hinders several such relations being in the same subject. Thus if a man teach grammar to some and <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> to others, his teaching is of a different kind in one case and in the other; and therefore one and the same <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may have different relations as the master of different <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, or of the same <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> in regard to diverse doctrines. Sometimes, however, it happens that a man bears a relation to several in respect of various <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, but of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>: thus a father may have several sons by several acts of generation. Wherefore the paternity cannot differ specifically, since the acts of generation are specifically the same. And because several forms of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> cannot at the same time be in the same subject, it is impossible for several paternities to be in a man who is the father of several sons by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> generation. But it would not be so were he the father of one son by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> generation and of another by adoption.

<p>Now, it is manifest that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not born by one and the same nativity, of the Father from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, and of His Mother in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>: indeed, these two nativities differ specifically. Wherefore, as to this, we must say that there are various filiations, one temporal and the other <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. Since, however, the subject of filiation is neither the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> nor part of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> or hypostasis alone; and since in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there is no other hypostasis or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> than the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, there can be no other filiation in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> but that which is in the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> hypostasis. Now, every relation which is predicated of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from time does not put something real in the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but only something according to our way of thinking, as we have said in I, 13, 7. Therefore the filiation by which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is referred to His Mother cannot be a real relation, but only a relation of reason.

<p>Consequently each opinion is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to a certain extent. For if we consider the adequate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of filiation, we must needs say that there are two filiations in respect of the twofold nativity. But if we consider the subject of filiation, which can only be the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> suppositum, then no other than the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> filiation in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is a real relation. Nevertheless, He has the relation of Son in regard to His Mother, because it is implied in the relation of motherhood to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Thus <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is called Lord by a relation which is implied in the real relation by which the creature is subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And although lordship is not a real relation in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet is He really Lord through the real subjection of the creature to Him. In the same way <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is really the Son of the Virgin Mother through the real relation of her motherhood to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Temporal nativity would <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a real temporal filiation in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> if there were in Him a subject capable of such filiation. But this cannot be; since the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> suppositum cannot be receptive of a temporal relation, as stated above. Nor can it be said that it is receptive of temporal filiation by reason of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, just as it is receptive of the temporal nativity; because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> would need in some way to be the subject of filiation, just as in a way it is the subject of nativity; for since an Ethiopian is said to be white by reason of his teeth, it must be that his teeth are the subject of whiteness. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> can nowise be the subject of filiation, because this relation regards directly the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">Eternal</a> filiation does not depend on a temporal mother, but together with this <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> filiation we understand a certain temporal relation dependent on the mother, in respect of which relation <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is called the Son of His Mother.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> One and being are mutually consequent, as is said Metaph. iv. Therefore, just as it happens that in one of the extremes of a relation there is something real, whereas in the other there is not something real, but merely a certain aspect, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> observes of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; so also it happens that on the part of one extreme there is one relation, whereas on the part of the other there are many. Thus in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> on the part of his parents there is a twofold relation, the one of paternity, the other of motherhood, which are specifically diverse, inasmuch as the father is the principle of generation in one way, and the mother in another (whereas if many be the principle of one action and in the same way--for instance, if many. together draw a ship along--there would be one and the same relation in all of them); but on the part of the child there is but one filiation in reality, though there be two in aspect, corresponding to the two relations in the parents, as considered by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. And thus in one way there is only one real filiation in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which is in respect of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">Eternal</a> Father: yet there is another temporal relation in regard to His temporal mother.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether Christ was born without His Mother suffering?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not born without His Mother suffering. For just as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> death was a result of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of our first parents, according to <a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse17">Genesis 2:17</a>: "In what day soever ye shall eat, ye shall [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'thou shalt eat of it, thou shalt] die"; so were the pains of childbirth, according to <a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse16">Genesis 3:16</a>: "In sorrow shalt thou bring forth children." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was willing to undergo death. Therefore for the same reason it seems that His birth should have been with pain.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the end is proportionate to the beginning. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> ended His life in pain, according to <a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse4">Isaiah 53:4</a>: "Surely . . . He hath carried our sorrows." Therefore it seems that His nativity was not without the pains of childbirth.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in the book on the birth of our Saviour [Protevangelium Jacobi xix, xx] it is related that midwives were present at <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth; and they would be wanted by reason of the mother's suffering pain. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> suffered pain in giving birth to her Child.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Serm. de Nativ. [Supposititious), addressing himself to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin-Mother</a>: "In conceiving thou wast all pure, in giving birth thou wast without pain."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The pains of childbirth are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the infant opening the passage from the womb. Now it has been said above (28, 2, Replies to objections), that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> came forth from the closed womb of His Mother, and, consequently, without opening the passage. Consequently there was no pain in that birth, as neither was there any corruption; on the contrary, there was much <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> therein for that God-Man "was born into the world," according to <a href="../bible/isa035.htm#verse1">Isaiah 35:1-2</a>: "Like the lily, it shall bud forth and blossom, and shall rejoice with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and praise."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The pains of childbirth in the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> follow from the mingling of the sexes. Wherefore (<a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse16">Genesis 3:16</a>) after the words, "in sorrow shalt thou bring forth children," the following are added: "and thou shalt be under thy husband's power." But, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Serm. de Assumpt. B. Virg., [Supposititious), from this sentence we must exclude the Virgin-Mother of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; who, "because she conceived <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> without the defilement of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and without the stain of sexual mingling, therefore did she bring Him forth without pain, without violation of her virginal integrity, without detriment to the purity of her maidenhood." <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, indeed, suffered death, but through His own spontaneous desire, in order to <a href="../cathen/02055a.htm">atone</a> for us, not as a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> result of that sentence, for He was not a debtor unto death.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As "by His death" <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> "destroyed our death" [Preface of the Mass in Paschal-time, so by His pains He freed us from our pains; and so He wished to die a painful death. But the mother's pains in childbirth did not concern <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who came to <a href="../cathen/02055a.htm">atone</a> for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. And therefore there was no need for His Mother to suffer in giving birth.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> We are told (<a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse7">Luke 2:7</a>) that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> herself "wrapped up in swaddling clothes" the Child whom she had brought forth, "and laid Him in a manger." Consequently the narrative of this book, which is <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a>, is untrue. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (Adv. Helvid. iv): "No midwife was there, no officious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> interfered. She was both mother and midwife. 'With swaddling clothes,' says he, 'she wrapped up the child, and laid Him in a manger.'" These words <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the falseness of the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> ravings.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether Christ should have been born in Bethlehem?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should not have been born in Bethlehem. For it is written (<a href="../bible/isa002.htm#verse3">Isaiah 2:3</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> shall come forth from Sion, and the Word of the Lord from Jerusalem." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>. Therefore He should have come into the world at Jerusalem.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is said (<a href="../bible/mat002.htm#verse23">Matthew 2:23</a>) that it is written of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> that "He shall be called a Nazarene"; which is taken from <a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse1">Isaiah 11:1</a>: "A flower shall rise up out of his root"; for "Nazareth" is interpreted "a flower." But a man is named especially from the place of his birth. Therefore it seems that He should have been born in Nazareth, where also He was conceived and brought up.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, for this was <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> born into the world, that He might make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. according to <a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse37">John 18:37</a>: "For this was I born, and for this came I into the world; that I should give testimony to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." But this would have been easier if He had been born in the city of Rome, which at that time ruled the world; whence <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, writing to the Romans (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse8">1:8</a>) says: "Your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is spoken of in the whole world." Therefore it seems that He should not have been born in Bethlehem.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mic005.htm#verse2">Micah 5:2</a>): "And thou, Bethlehem, Ephrata . . . out of thee shall He come forth unto Me, that is to be the ruler in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> willed to be born in Bethlehem for two reasons. First, because "He was made . . . of the seed of David according to the flesh," as it is written (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse3">Romans 1:3</a>); to whom also was a special promise made concerning Christ; according to <a href="../bible/2sa023.htm#verse1">2 Samuel 23:1</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to whom it was appointed concerning the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> . . . said." Therefore He willed to be born at Bethlehem, where David was born, in order that by the very birthplace the promise made to David might be shown to be fulfilled. The Evangelist points this out by saying: "Because He was of the house and of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of David." Secondly, because, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. viii in Evang.): "Bethlehem is interpreted 'the house of bread.' It is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself who said, 'I am the living Bread which came down from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.'"

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As David was born in Bethlehem, so also did he choose Jerusalem to set up his throne there, and to build there the Temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so that Jerusalem was at the same time a royal and a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> city. Now, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and kingdom were "consummated" principally in His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. Therefore it was becoming that He should choose Bethlehem for His Birthplace and Jerusalem for the scene of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>.

<p>At the same time, too, He put to silence the vain boasting of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who take <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> in being born in great cities, where also they desire especially to receive <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, on the contrary, willed to be born in a mean city, and to suffer reproach in a great city.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> wished "to flower" by His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> life, not in His carnal birth. Therefore He wished to be fostered and brought up at Nazareth. But He wished to be born at Bethlehem away from home; because, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. viii in Evang.), through the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which He had taken, He was born, as it were, in a foreign place--foreign not to His power, but to His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>. And, again, as <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> says on <a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse7">Luke 2:7</a>: "In order that He who found no room at the inn might prepare many mansions for us in His Father's house."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> According to a sermon in the Council of Ephesus [P. iii, cap. ix]: "If He had chosen the great city of Rome, the change in the world would be ascribed to the influence of her citizens. If He had been the son of the Emperor, His benefits would have been attributed to the latter's power. But that we might acknowledge the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the transformation of the whole earth, He chose a poor mother and a birthplace poorer still."

<p>"But the weak things of the world hath <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> chosen, that He may confound the strong" (<a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse27">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>). And therefore, in order the more to show His power, He set up the head of His Church in Rome itself, which was the head of the world, in sign of His complete victory, in order that from that city the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> might spread throughout the world; according to <a href="../bible/isa026.htm#verse5">Isaiah 26:5-6</a>: "The high city He shall lay low . . . the feet of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>," i.e. of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, "shall tread it down; the steps of the needy," i.e. of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether Christ was born at a fitting time?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not born at a fitting time. Because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> came in order to restore liberty to His own. But He was born at a time of subjection--namely, when the whole world, as it were, tributary to Augustus, was being enrolled, at his command as Luke relates (<a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse1">2:1</a>). Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not born at a fitting time.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the promises concerning the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> were not made to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>; according to <a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse4">Romans 9:4</a>: "To whom belong . . . the promises." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was born during the reign of a foreigner, as appears from <a href="../bible/mat002.htm#verse1">Matthew 2:1</a>: "When <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was born in the days of King Herod." Therefore it seems that He was not born at a fitting time.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the time of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> presence on earth is compared to the day, because He is the "Light of the world"; wherefore He says Himself (<a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse4">John 9:4</a>): "I must work the works of Him that sent Me, whilst it is day." But in summer the days are longer than in winter. Therefore, since He was born in the depth of winter, eight days before the Kalends of January, it seems that He was not born at a fitting time.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse4">Galatians 4:4</a>): "When the fulness of the time was come, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, made under the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There is this difference between <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and other men, that, whereas they are born subject to the restrictions of time, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as Lord and Maker of all time, chose a time in which to be born, just as He chose a mother and a birthplace. And since "what is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is well ordered" and becomingly arranged, it follows that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was born at a most fitting time.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> came in order to bring us back from a state of bondage to a state of liberty. And therefore, as He took our mortal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in order to restore us to life, so, as <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> says (Super Luc. ii, 4,5), "He deigned to take flesh at such a time that, shortly after His birth, He would be enrolled in Caesar's census, and thus submit Himself to bondage for the sake of our liberty."

<p>Moreover, at that time, when the whole world lived under one ruler, peace abounded on the earth. Therefore it was a fitting time for the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, for "He is our peace, who hath made both one," as it is written (<a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse14">Ephesians 2:14</a>). Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on <a href="../bible/isa002.htm#verse4">Isaiah 2:4</a>: "If we search the page of ancient history, we shall find that throughout the whole world there was discord until the twenty-eighth year of Augustus Caesar: but when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> was born, all <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> ceased"; according to <a href="../bible/isa002.htm#verse4">Isaiah 2:4</a>: "Nation shall not lift up sword against nation."

<p>Again, it was fitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should be born while the world was governed by one ruler, because "He came to gather His own [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>'] together in one" (<a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse52">John 11:52</a>), that there might be "one fold and one shepherd" (<a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse16">John 10:16</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> wished to be born during the reign of a foreigner, that the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> might be fulfilled (<a href="../bible/gen049.htm#verse10">Genesis 49:10</a>): "The sceptre shall not be taken away from <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, nor a ruler from his thigh, till He come that is to be sent." Because, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. ii in Matth. [Opus Imperf., <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>), as long as the Jewish "people was governed by Jewish kings, however <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> were sent for their healing. But now that the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is under the power of a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> king, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is born; because a grave and hopeless disease demanded a more skilful physician."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As says the author of the book De Qq. Nov. et Vet. Test., "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> wished to be born, when the light of day begins to increase in length," so as to show that He came in order that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> might come nearer to the Divine Light, according to <a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse79">Luke 1:79</a>: "To enlighten them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death."

<p>In like manner He chose to be born in the rough winter season, that He might begin from then to suffer in body for us.
