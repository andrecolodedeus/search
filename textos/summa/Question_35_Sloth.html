<h1>Question 35. Sloth</h1>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether sloth is a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that sloth is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For we are neither praised nor blamed for our <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. ii, 5). Now sloth is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, since it is a kind of sorrow, according to <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. ii, 14), and as we stated above (I-II, 35, 8). Therefore sloth is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no bodily failing that occurs at fixed times is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>But sloth is like this, for Cassian says (De Instit. Monast. x, [De Institutione Caeobiorum]): "The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> is troubled with sloth chiefly about the sixth hour: it is like an intermittent fever, and inflicts the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the one it lays low with burning fires at regular and fixed intervals." Therefore sloth is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that which proceeds from a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> root is, seemingly, no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now sloth proceeds from a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> root, for Cassian says (De Instit. Monast. x) that "sloth arises from the fact that we sigh at being deprived of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> fruit, and think that other monasteries and those which are a long way off are much better than the one we dwell in": all of which seems to point to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>. Therefore sloth is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is to be avoided, according to <a href="../bible/sir021.htm#verse2">Sirach 21:2</a>: "Flee from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> as from the face of a serpent." Now Cassian says (De Instit. Monast. x): "Experience shows that the onslaught of sloth is not to be evaded by flight but to be conquered by resistance." Therefore sloth is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Whatever is forbidden in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now such is sloth [acedia]: for it is written (<a href="../bible/sir006.htm#verse26">Sirach 6:26</a>): "Bow down thy shoulder, and bear her," namely <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> wisdom, "and be not grieved [acedieris] with her bands." Therefore sloth is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Sloth, according to <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. ii, 14) is an oppressive sorrow, which, to wit, so weighs upon <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> mind, that he wants to do nothing; thus acid things are also cold. Hence sloth implies a certain weariness of work, as appears from a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse18">Psalm 106:18</a>, "Their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> abhorred all manner of meat," and from the definition of some who say that sloth is a "sluggishness of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> which neglects to begin <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>."

<p>Now this sorrow is always <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, sometimes in itself, sometimes in its effect. For sorrow is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in itself when it is about that which is apparently <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> but <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in reality, even as, on the other hand, pleasure is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> if it is about that which seems to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> but is, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Since, then, <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, sorrow about <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in itself. And yet that sorrow also which is about a real <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in its effect, if it so oppresses <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as to draw him away entirely from <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse7">2 Corinthians 2:7</a>) did not wish those who repented to be "swallowed up with overmuch sorrow."

<p>Accordingly, since sloth, as we understand it here, denotes sorrow for <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> on two counts, both in itself and in point of its effect. Consequently it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> we mean an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, as appears from what has been said above (10, 2; I-II, 74, 4).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Passions are not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> in themselves; but they are blameworthy in so far as they are applied to something <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, just as they deserve praise in so far as they are applied to something <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Wherefore sorrow, in itself, calls neither for praise nor for blame: whereas moderate sorrow for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> calls for praise, while sorrow for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and again immoderate sorrow for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, call for blame. It is in this sense that sloth is said to be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> may either be venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in themselves, or incline the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And since the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> has a bodily organ, it follows that on account of some bodily transmutation a man becomes apt to commit some particular <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Hence it may happen that certain <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> may become more insistent, through certain bodily transmutations occurring at certain fixed times. Now all bodily effects, of themselves, dispose one to sorrow; and thus it is that those who fast are harassed by sloth towards mid-day, when they begin to feel the want of food, and to be parched by the sun's heat.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is a sign of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> if a man does not think too much of himself, through observing his own faults; but if a man contemns the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things he has received from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, this, far from being a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, shows him to be ungrateful: and from such like contempt results sloth, because we sorrow for things that we reckon <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and worthless. Accordingly we ought to think much of the goods of others, in such a way as not to disparage those we have received ourselves, because if we did they would give us sorrow.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Sin is ever to be shunned, but the assaults of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> should be overcome, sometimes by flight, sometimes by resistance; by flight when a continued thought increases the incentive to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as in <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>; for which reason it is written (<a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse18">1 Corinthians 6:18</a>): "Fly fornication"; by resistance, when perseverance in the thought diminishes the incentive to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which incentive arises from some trivial consideration. This is the case with sloth, because the more we think about <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods, the more pleasing they become to us, and forthwith sloth dies away.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether sloth is a special vice?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that sloth is not a special <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. For that which is common to all <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> does not constitute a special kind of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. But every <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> makes a man sorrowful about the opposite <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lustful</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is sorrowful about the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">glutton</a> about the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of abstinence. Since then sloth is sorrow for <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), it seems that sloth is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, sloth, through being a kind of sorrow, is opposed to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is not accounted one special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore sloth should not be reckoned a special <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, since <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is a general kind of object, which <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> seeks, and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> shuns, it does not constitute a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> or <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, unless it be determined by some addition. Now nothing, seemingly, except toil, can determine it to sloth, if this be a special <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>; because the reason why a man shuns <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods, is that they are toilsome, wherefore sloth is a kind of weariness: while dislike of toil, and love of bodily repose seem to be due to the same <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, viz. idleness. Hence sloth would be nothing but laziness, which seems <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>, for idleness is opposed to carefulness, whereas sloth is opposed to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. Therefore sloth is not a special <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi, 45) distinguishes sloth from the other <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. Therefore it is a special <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since sloth is sorrow for <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, if we take <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in a general way, sloth will not be a special <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, because, as stated above (I-II, 71, 1), every <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> shuns the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of its opposite <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Again it cannot be said that sloth is a special <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, in so far as it shuns <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as toilsome, or troublesome to the body, or as a hindrance to the body's pleasure, for this again would not sever sloth from carnal <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, whereby a man seeks bodily comfort and pleasure.

<p>Wherefore we must say that a certain order <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> among <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods, since all the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods that are in the acts of each <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are directed to one <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, about which there is a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, viz. <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Hence it is proper to each <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to rejoice in its own <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which consists in its own act, while it belongs specially to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> to have that <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> whereby one rejoices in the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. On like manner the sorrow whereby one is displeased at the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is in each act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, belongs, not to any special <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, but to every <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, but sorrow in the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> about which <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> rejoices, belongs to a special <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, which is called sloth. This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether sloth is a mortal sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that sloth is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For every mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is contrary to a precept of the Divine Law. But sloth seems contrary to no precept, as one may see by going through the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">Decalogue</a>. Therefore sloth is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in the same genus, a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> is no less grievous than a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of thought. Now it is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to refrain in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> from some <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which leads to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, else it would be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not to observe the counsels. Therefore it is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to refrain in thought from such like <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> works. Therefore sloth is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is to be found in a perfect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But sloth is to be found in a perfect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: for Cassian says (De Instit. Caenob. x, l) that "sloth is well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the solitary, and is a most vexatious and persistent foe to the hermit." Therefore sloth is not always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/2co007.htm#verse20">2 Corinthians 7:20</a>): "The sorrow of the world worketh death." But such is sloth; for it is not sorrow "according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," which is contrasted with sorrow of the world. Therefore it is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (I-II, 88, 1,2), mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is so called because it destroys the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life which is the effect of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, whereby <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> dwells in us. Wherefore any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which by its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by reason of its genus. And such is sloth, because the proper effect of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated above (Question 28, Article 1), while sloth is sorrow about <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in as much as it is a Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore sloth is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in respect of its genus. But it must be observed with regard to all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that are mortal in respect of their genus, that they are not mortal, save when they attain to their perfection. Because the consummation of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is in the consent of reason: for we are speaking now of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> consisting in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, the principle of which is the reason. Wherefore if the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be a mere beginning of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the sensuality alone, without attaining to the consent of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, it is a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> on account of the imperfection of the act. Thus in the genus of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> that goes no further than the sensuality is a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, whereas if it reach to the consent of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, it is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. So too, the movement of sloth is sometimes in the sensuality alone, by reason of the opposition of the flesh to the spirit, and then it is a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; whereas sometimes it reaches to the reason, which consents in the dislike, horror and detestation of the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, on account of the flesh utterly prevailing over the spirit. On this case it is evident that sloth is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Sloth is opposed to the precept about hallowing the Sabbath day. For this precept, in so far as it is a moral precept, implicitly commands the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to rest in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and sorrow of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> about the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is contrary thereto.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Sloth is not an aversion of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> from any <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but from the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, to which the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to adhere. Wherefore if a man is sorry because someone forces him to do acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that he is not bound to do, this is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of sloth; but when he is sorry to have to do something for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Imperfect movements of sloth are to be found in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, but they do not reach to the consent of reason.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether sloth should be accounted a capital vice?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that sloth ought not to be accounted a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. For a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is one that moves a man to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> acts, as stated above (Question 34, Article 5). Now sloth does not move one to action, but on the contrary withdraws one from it. Therefore it should not be accounted a capital <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a capital <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is one to which daughters are assigned. Now <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi, 45) assigns six daughters to sloth, viz. "<a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, spite, faint-heartedness, <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, sluggishness in regard to the commandments, wandering of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> after unlawful things." Now these do not seem in reality to arise from sloth. For "spite" is, seemingly the same as <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, which arises from <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, as stated above (Question 34, Article 6); "<a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>" is a genus which contains all <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, and, in like manner, a "wandering" of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> after unlawful things is to be found in every <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>; "sluggishness" about the commandments seems to be the same as sloth, while "faint-heartedness" and "<a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>" may arise from any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore sloth is not rightly accounted a capital <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> distinguishes the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of sloth from the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of sorrow, saying (De Summo Bono ii, 37) that in so far as a man shirks his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> because it is distasteful and burdensome, it is sorrow, and in so far as he is inclined to undue repose, it is sloth: and of sorrow he says that it gives rise to "spite, faint-heartedness, bitterness, <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>," whereas he states that from sloth seven things arise, viz. "idleness, drowsiness, uneasiness of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, restlessness of the body, instability, loquacity, curiosity." Therefore it seems that either <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> or <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> has wrongly assigned sloth as a capital <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> together with its daughters.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The same <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi, 45) states that sloth is a capital <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and has the daughters aforesaid.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (I-II, 84, 3,4), a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is one which easily gives rise to others as being their final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Now just as we do many things on account of pleasure, both in order to obtain it, and through being moved to do something under the impulse of pleasure, so again we do many things on account of sorrow, either that we may avoid it, or through being exasperated into doing something under pressure thereof. Wherefore, since sloth is a kind of sorrow, as stated above (2; I-II, 85, 8), it is fittingly reckoned a capital <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Sloth by weighing on the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, hinders us from doing things that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> sorrow: nevertheless it induces the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to do certain things, either because they are in harmony with sorrow, such as weeping, or because they are a means of avoiding sorrow.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> fittingly assigns the daughters of sloth. For since, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. viii, 5,6) "no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can be a long time in company with what is painful and unpleasant," it follows that something arises from sorrow in two ways: first, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shuns whatever <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> sorrow; secondly, that he passes to other things that give him pleasure: thus those who find no <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> pleasures, have recourse to pleasures of the body, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. x, 6). Now in the avoidance of sorrow the order observed is that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> at first flies from unpleasant objects, and secondly he even struggles against such things as <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> sorrow. Now <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods which are the object of the sorrow of sloth, are both end and means. Avoidance of the end is the result of "<a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>," while avoidance of those goods which are the means to the end, in matters of difficulty which come under the counsels, is the effect of "faint-heartedness," and in matters of common righteousness, is the effect of "sluggishness about the commandments." The struggle against <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> sorrow is sometimes with men who lead others to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods, and this is called "spite"; and sometimes it extends to the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods themselves, when a man goes so far as to detest them, and this is properly called "<a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>." On so far as a man has recourse to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> objects of pleasure, the daughter of sloth is called "wandering after unlawful things." From this it is clear how to reply to the objections against each of the daughters: for "<a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>" does not denote here that which is generic to all <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, but must be understood as explained. Nor is "spite" taken as synonymous with <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, but for a kind of indignation, as stated above: and the same applies to the others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This distinction between sorrow and sloth is also given by Cassian (De Instit. Caenob. x, 1). But <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> more fittingly (Moral. xxxi, 45) calls sloth a kind of sorrow, because, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), sorrow is not a distinct <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, in so far as a man shirks a distasteful and burdensome work, or sorrows on account of any other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> whatever, but only in so far as he is sorry on account of the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which sorrow belongs <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> to sloth; since sloth seeks undue rest in so far as it spurns the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Moreover the things which <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> reckons to arise from sloth and sorrow, are reduced to those mentioned by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>: for "bitterness" which <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> states to be the result of sorrow, is an effect of "spite." "Idleness" and "drowsiness" are reduced to "sluggishness about the precepts": for some are idle and omit them altogether, while others are drowsy and fulfil them with negligence. All the other five which he reckons as effects of sloth, belong to the "wandering of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> after unlawful things." This tendency to wander, if it reside in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> itself that is desirous of rushing after various things without rhyme or reason, is called "uneasiness of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>," but if it pertains to the imaginative power, it is called "curiosity"; if it affect the speech it is called "loquacity"; and in so far as it affects a body that changes place, it is called "restlessness of the body," when, to wit, a man shows the unsteadiness of his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, by the inordinate movements of members of his body; while if it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the body to move from one place to another, it is called "instability"; or "instability" may denote changeableness of purpose.
