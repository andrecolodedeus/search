<h1>Question 35. The Image</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1035.htm#article1"> Is Image in God said personally?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1035.htm#article2"> Does this name belong to the Son alone?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether image in God is said personally?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that image is not said personally of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Fulgentius, De Fide ad Petrum i) says, "The Godhead of the Holy <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> and the Image whereunto <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is made are one." Therefore Image is said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, and not personally.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (De Synod.): "An image is a like <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of that which it represents." But <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> or form is said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>. Therefore so also is Image.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, Image is derived from imitation, which implies "before" and "after." But in the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> there is no "before" and "after." Therefore Image cannot be a personal name in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. vii, 1): "What is more absurd than to say that an image is referred to itself?" Therefore the Image in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a relation, and is thus a personal name.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Image includes the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of similitude. Still, not any kind of similitude suffices for the notion of image, but only similitude of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, or at least of some specific sign. In corporeal things the specific sign consists chiefly in the figure. For we see that the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of different animals are of different figures; but not of different colors. Hence if the color of anything is depicted on a wall, this is not called an image unless the figure is likewise depicted. Further, neither the similitude of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> or of figure is enough for an image, which requires also the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of origin; because, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. lxxxiii, qu. 74): "One egg is not the image of another, because it is not derived from it." Therefore for a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> image it is required that one proceeds from another like to it in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, or at least in specific sign. Now whatever imports procession or origin in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, belongs to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Hence the name "Image" is a personal name.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Image, properly speaking, means whatever proceeds forth in likeness to another. That to the likeness of which anything proceeds, is properly speaking called the exemplar, and is improperly called the image. Nevertheless <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Fulgentius) uses the name of Image in this sense when he says that the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Holy <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> is the Image to whom <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was made.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> "Species," as mentioned by <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> in the definition of image, means the form derived from one thing to another. In this sense image is said to be the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of anything, as that which is assimilated to anything is called its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, inasmuch as it has a like form.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Imitation in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not signify posteriority, but only assimilation.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the name of Image is proper to the Son?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the name of Image is not proper to the Son; because, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. i, 18), "The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is the Image of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>." Therefore Image does not belong to the Son alone.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, similitude in expression belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an image, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. lxxxiii, qu. 74). But this belongs to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, Who proceeds from another by way of similitude. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is an Image; and so to be Image does not belong to the Son alone.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is also called the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse7">1 Corinthians 11:7</a>, "The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ought not to cover his head, for he is the image and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore Image is not proper to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. vi, 2): "The Son alone is the Image of the Father."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The Greek Doctors commonly say that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is the Image of both the Father and of the Son; but the <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> Doctors attribute the name Image to the Son alone. For it is not found in the canonical <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> except as applied to the Son; as in the words, "Who is the Image of the invisible <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the firstborn of creatures" (<a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse15">Colossians 1:15</a>) and again: "Who being the brightness of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and the figure of His <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>." (<a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse3">Hebrews 1:3</a>).

<p>Some explain this by the fact that the Son agrees with the Father, not in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> only, but also in the notion of principle: whereas the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> agrees neither with the Son, nor with the Father in any notion. This, however, does not seem to suffice. Because as it is not by reason of the relations that we consider either equality or inequality in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. v, 6), so neither (by reason thereof do we consider) that similitude which is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to image. Hence others say that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> cannot be called the Image of the Son, because there cannot be an image of an image; nor of the Father, because again the image must be immediately related to that which it is the image; and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is related to the Father through the Son; nor again is He the Image of the Father and the Son, because then there would be one image of two; which is impossible. Hence it follows that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is in no way an Image. But this is no <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>: for the Father and the Son are one principle of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as we shall explain further on (36, 4). Hence there is nothing to prevent there being one Image of the Father and of the Son, inasmuch as they are one; since even <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is one image of the whole <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>.

<p>Therefore we must explain the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> otherwise by saying that, as the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, although by His procession He receives the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Father, as the Son also receives it, nevertheless is not said to be "born"; so, although He receives the likeness of the Father, He is not called the Image; because the Son proceeds as word, and it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to word to be like <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> with that whence it proceeds; whereas this does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> belong to love, although it may belong to that love which is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, inasmuch as He is the divine love.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> and the other Greek Doctors commonly employ the term image as meaning a perfect similitude.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is like to the Father and the Son, still it does not follow that He is the Image, as above explained.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The image of a thing may be found in something in two ways. In one way it is found in something of the same specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; as the image of the king is found in his son. In another way it is found in something of a different <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as the king's image on the coin. In the first sense the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is the Image of the Father; in the second sense <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is called the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and therefore in order to express the imperfect character of the divine image in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not simply called the image, but "to the image," whereby is expressed a certain movement of tendency to perfection. But it cannot be said that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is "to the image," because He is the perfect Image of the Father.
