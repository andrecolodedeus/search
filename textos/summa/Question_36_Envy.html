<h1>Question 36. Envy</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3036.htm#article1"> What is envy?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3036.htm#article2"> Is it a sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3036.htm#article3"> Is it a mortal sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3036.htm#article4"> Is it a capital sin, and which are its daughters?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether envy is a kind of sorrow?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is not a kind of sorrow. For the object of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, for <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. v, 46) of the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that "self-inflicted pain wounds the pining spirit, which is racked by the prosperity of another." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is not a kind of sorrow.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, likeness is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, not of sorrow but rather of pleasure. But likeness is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 10): "Men are <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> of such as are like them in genus, in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, in stature, in <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, or in reputation." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is not a kind of sorrow.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, sorrow is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by a defect, wherefore those who are in great defect are inclined to sorrow, as stated above (I-II, 47, 3) when we were treating of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Now those who lack little, and who love honors, and who are considered wise, are <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Rhet. ii, 10). Therefore <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is not a kind of sorrow.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, sorrow is opposed to pleasure. Now opposite effects have not one and the same <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Therefore, since the recollection of goods once possessed is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure, as stated above (I-II, 32, 3) it will not be a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sorrow. But it is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>; for the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 10) that "we <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> those who have or have had things that befitted ourselves, or which we possessed at some time." Therefore sloth is not a kind of sorrow.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. ii, 14) calls <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of sorrow, and says that "<a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is sorrow for another's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The object of a man's sorrow is his own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Now it may happen that another's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is apprehended as one's own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and in this way sorrow can be about another's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But this happens in two ways: first, when a man is sorry about another's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, in so far as it threatens to be an occasion of harm to himself, as when a man grieves for his enemy's prosperity, for fear lest he may do him some harm: such like sorrow is not <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, but rather an effect of fear, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Rhet. ii, 9).

<p>Secondly, another's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> may be reckoned as being one's own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, in so far as it conduces to the lessening of one's own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> name or excellence. It is in this way that <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> grieves for another's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: and consequently men are <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> of those goods in which a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> name consists, and about which men like to be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> and esteemed, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> remarks (Rhet. ii, 10).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Nothing hinders what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for one from being reckoned as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for another: and in this way it is possible for sorrow to be about <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is about another's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> name in so far as it diminishes the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> name a man desires to have, it follows that a man is <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> of those only whom he wishes to rival or surpass in reputation.

<p>But this does not apply to people who are far removed from one another: for no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, unless he be out of his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, endeavors to rival or surpass in reputation those who are far above him. Thus a commoner does not <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> the king, nor does the king <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> a commoner whom he is far above. Wherefore a man envies not those who are far removed from him, whether in place, time, or station, but those who are near him, and whom he strives to rival or surpass. For it is against our will that these should be in better repute than we are, and that gives rise to sorrow. On the other hand, likeness <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> pleasure in so far as it is in agreement with the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not strive for mastery in matters where he is very deficient; so that he does not <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> one who surpasses him in such matters, unless he surpass him by little, for then it seems to him that this is not beyond him, and so he makes an effort; wherefore, if his effort fails through the other's reputation surpassing his, he grieves. Hence it is that those who love to be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> are more <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a>; and in like manner the faint-hearted are <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a>, because all things are great to them, and whatever <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> may befall another, they reckon that they themselves have been bested in something great. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/job005.htm#verse2">Job 5:2</a>): "Envy slayeth the little one," and <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. v, 46) that "we can <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> those only whom we think better in some respect than ourselves."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Recollection of past goods in so far as we have had them, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> pleasure; in so far as we have lost them, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> sorrow; and in so far as others have them, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, because that, above all, seems to belittle our reputation. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii) that the old <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> the young, and those who have spent much in order to get something, <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> those who have got it by spending little, because they grieve that they have lost their goods, and that others have acquired goods.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether envy is a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says to Laeta about the education of her daughter (Ep. cvii): "Let her have companions, so that she may learn together with them, <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> them, and be nettled when they are praised." But no one should be advised to commit a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> Further, "Envy is sorrow for another's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 14). But this is sometimes praiseworthy: for it is written (<a href="../bible/pro029.htm#verse2">Proverbs 29:2</a>): "When the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> shall bear rule, the people shall mourn." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is not always a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> denotes a kind of zeal. But there is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> zeal, according to <a href="../bible/psa068.htm#verse10">Psalm 68:10</a>: "The zeal of Thy house hath eaten me up." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is not always a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, punishment is condivided with fault. But <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is a kind of punishment: for <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. v, 46): "When the foul sore of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> corrupts the vanquished heart, the very exterior itself shows how forcibly the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is urged by <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>. For paleness seizes the complexion, the eyes are weighed down, the spirit is inflamed, while the limbs are chilled, there is frenzy in the heart, there is gnashing with the teeth." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse26">Galatians 5:26</a>): "Let us not be made desirous of vainglory, provoking one another, envying one another."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is sorrow for another's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now this sorrow may come about in four ways. First, when a man grieves for another's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, through fear that it may <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> harm either to himself, or to some other goods. This sorrow is not <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), and may be void of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxii, 11): "It very often happens that without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> being lost, both the destruction of an enemy rejoices us, and again his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, without any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, saddens us, since, when he falls, we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that some are deservedly set up, and when he prospers, we dread lest many suffer <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>."

<p>Secondly, we may grieve over another's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, not because he has it, but because the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which he has, we have not: and this, properly speaking, is zeal, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 9). And if this zeal be about <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> goods, it is praiseworthy, according to <a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse1">1 Corinthians 14:1</a>: "Be zealous for <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>": while, if it be about temporal goods, it may be either <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> or sinless. Thirdly, one may grieve over another's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, because he who happens to have that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is unworthy of it. Such sorrow as this cannot be occasioned by <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> goods, which make a man righteous, but, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states, is about <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, and those things which can accrue to the worthy and the unworthy; and he calls this sorrow <em>nemesis</em> [The nearest equivalent is "indignation." The use of the word "nemesis" to signify "revenge" does not represent the original Greek.], saying that it belongs to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> morals. But he says this because he considered temporal goods in themselves, in so far as they may seem great to those who look not to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> goods: whereas, according to the teaching of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, temporal goods that accrue to those who are unworthy, are so disposed according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> just ordinance, either for the correction of those men, or for their condemnation, and such goods are as nothing in comparison with the goods to come, which are prepared for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> men. Wherefore sorrow of this kind is forbidden in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa036.htm#verse1">Psalm 36:1</a>: "Be not emulous of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> doers, nor <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> them that work <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>," and elsewhere (<a href="../bible/psa072.htm#verse2">Psalm 72:2-3</a>): "My steps had well nigh slipped, for I was <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, when I saw the prosperity of sinners [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'because I had a zeal on occasion of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, seeing the prosperity of sinners']." Fourthly, we grieve over a man's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, in so far as his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> surpasses ours; this is <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> properly speaking, and is always <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, as also the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Rhet. ii, 10), because to do so is to grieve over what should make us rejoice, viz. over our neighbor's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Envy there denotes the zeal with which we ought to strive to progress with those who are better than we are.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument considers sorrow for another's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in the first sense given above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Envy differs from zeal, as stated above. Hence a certain zeal may be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, whereas <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is always <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Nothing hinders a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from being penal <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, as stated above (I-II, 87, 2) when we were treating of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether envy is a mortal sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For since <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is a kind of sorrow, it is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Now there is no mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the sensuality, but only in the reason, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> declares (De Trin. xii, 12) [Cf. I-II, 74, 4]. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, there cannot be mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in infants. But <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> can be in them, for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. i): "I myself have seen and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> even a baby <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a>, it could not speak, yet it turned pale and looked bitterly on its foster-brother." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is contrary to some <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is contrary, not to a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> but to <em>nemesis</em>, which is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Rhet. ii, 9). Therefore <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/job005.htm#verse2">Job 5:2</a>): "Envy slayeth the little one." Now nothing slays spiritually, except mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Envy is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in respect of its genus. For the genus of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is taken from its object; and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> according to the aspect of its object is contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, whence the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> derives its <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life, according to <a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse14">1 John 3:14</a>: "We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren." Now the object both of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is our neighbor's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but by contrary movements, since <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> rejoices in our neighbor's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, while <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> grieves over it, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore it is evident that <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in respect of its genus.

<p>Nevertheless, as stated above (35, 4; I-II, 72, 5, ad 1), in every kind of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> we find certain imperfect movements in the sensuality, which are venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: such are the first movement of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, in the genus of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, and the first movement of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, in the genus of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, and so in the genus of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> we find sometimes even in perfect men certain first movements, which are venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The movement of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> in so far as it is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the sensuality, is an imperfect thing in the genus of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, the principle of which is the reason, so that <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> of that kind is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. The same applies to the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> of little children who have not the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>: wherefore the Reply to the Second Objection is manifest.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Rhet. ii, 9), <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is contrary both to <em>nemesis</em> and to pity, but for different reasons. For it is directly contrary to pity, their principal objects being contrary to one another, since the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> grieves over his neighbor's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, whereas the pitiful <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> grieves over his neighbor's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, so that the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> have no pity, as he states in the same passage, nor is the pitiful <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a>. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is contrary to <em>nemesis</em> on the part of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whose <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> grieves the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, for <em>nemesis</em> is sorrow for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the undeserving according to <a href="../bible/psa072.htm#verse3">Psalm 72:3</a>: "I was <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, when I saw the prosperity of sinners" [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'because I had a zeal on occasion of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, seeing the prosperity of sinners'], whereas the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> grieves over the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of those who are deserving of it. Hence it is clear that the former contrariety is more direct than the latter. Now pity is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and an effect proper to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: so that <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is contrary to pity and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether envy is a capital vice?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is not a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. For the capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are distinct from their daughters. Now <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is the daughter of vainglory; for the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 10) that "those who love <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> are more <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is not a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> seem to be less grave than the other <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> which arise from them. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxi, 45): "The leading <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> seem to worm their way into the deceived mind under some kind of pretext, but those which follow them provoke the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to all kinds of outrage, and confuse the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> with their wild outcry." Now <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is seemingly a most grave <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. v, 46): "Though in every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thing that is done, the venom of our old enemy is infused into the heart of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, yet in this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> the serpent stirs his whole bowels and discharges the bane of spite fitted to enter deep into the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is not a capital <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it seems that its daughters are unfittingly assigned by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi, 45), who says that from <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> arise "<a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, tale-bearing, detraction, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> at our neighbor's misfortunes, and grief for his prosperity." For <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> at our neighbor's misfortunes and grief for his prosperity seem to be the same as <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, as appears from what has been said above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). Therefore these should not be assigned as daughters of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary</strong> stands the authority of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi, 45) who states that <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is a capital <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and assigns the aforesaid daughters thereto.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Just as sloth is grief for a Divine <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, so <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is grief for our neighbor's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now it has been stated above (Question 35, Article 4) that sloth is a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> for the reason that it incites <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to do certain things, with the purpose either of avoiding sorrow or of satisfying its demands. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is accounted a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> for the same reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxi, 45), "the capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are so closely akin to one another that one springs from the other. For the first offspring of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is vainglory, which by corrupting the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> it occupies begets <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, since while it craves for the power of an empty name, it repines for fear lest another should acquire that power." Consequently the notion of a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> does not exclude its originating from another <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, but it demands that it should have some principal reason for being itself the origin of several kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. However it is perhaps because <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> manifestly arises from vainglory, that it is not reckoned a capital <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, either by <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> (De Summo Bono) or by Cassian (De Instit. Caenob. v, 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It does not follow from the passage quoted that <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is the greatest of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but that when the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> tempts us to <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, he is enticing us to that which has its chief place in his heart, for as quoted further on in the same passage, "by the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, death came into the world" (<a href="../bible/wis002.htm#verse24">Wisdom 2:24</a>).

<p>There is, however, a kind of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> which is accounted among the most grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, viz. <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> of another's <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is a sorrow for the increase of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and not merely for our neighbor's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Hence it is accounted a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, because thereby a man envies, as it were, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> Himself, Who is glorified in His works.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The number of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy's</a> daughters may be understood for the reason that in the struggle aroused by <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> there is something by way of beginning, something by way of middle, and something by way of term. The beginning is that a man strives to lower another's reputation, and this either secretly, and then we have "tale-bearing," or openly, and then we have "detraction." The middle consists in the fact that when a man aims at defaming another, he is either able to do so, and then we have "<a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> at another's misfortune," or he is unable, and then we have "grief at another's prosperity." The term is <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> itself, because just as <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which delights <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> love, so does sorrow <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, as stated above (Question 34, Article 6). Grief at another's prosperity is in one way the very same as <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, when, to Wit, a man grieves over another's prosperity, in so far as it gives the latter a <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">good name</a>, but in another way it is a daughter of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, in so far as the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> sees his neighbor prosper notwithstanding his efforts to prevent it. On the other hand, "<a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> at another's misfortune" is not directly the same as <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, but is a result thereof, because grief over our neighbor's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, gives rise to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.
