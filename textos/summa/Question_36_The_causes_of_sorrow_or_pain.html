<h1>Question 36. The causes of sorrow or pain</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2036.htm#article1"> Is sorrow caused by the loss of a good or rather by the presence of an evil?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2036.htm#article2"> Is desire a cause of sorrow?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2036.htm#article3"> Is the craving for unity a cause of sorrow?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2036.htm#article4"> Is an irresistible power a cause of sorrow?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether sorrow is caused by the loss of good or by the presence of evil?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that sorrow is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the loss of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> rather than by the presence of an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De viii QQ. Dulcit. qu. 1) that sorrow is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the loss of temporal goods. Therefore, in like manner, every sorrow is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the loss of some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it was said above (Question 35, Article 4) that the sorrow which is contrary to a pleasure, has the same object as that pleasure. But the object of pleasure is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as stated above (23, 4; 31, 1; 35, 3). Therefore sorrow is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> chiefly by the loss of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei xiv, 7,9), love is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sorrow, as of the other emotions of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But the object of love is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore pain or sorrow is felt for the loss of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> rather than for an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that is present.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 12) that "the dreaded <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> gives rise to fear, the present <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sorrow."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> If privations, as considered by the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, were what they are in reality, this question would seem to be of no importance. For, as stated in the I, 14, 10 and I, 48, 3, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is the privation of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: and privation is in reality nothing else than the lack of the contrary <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>; so that, in this respect, to sorrow for the loss of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, would be the same as to sorrow for the presence of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But sorrow is a movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> in consequence of an apprehension: and even a privation, as apprehended, has the aspect of a being, wherefore it is called "a being of reason." And in this way <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, being a privation, is regarded as a "contrary." Accordingly, so far as the movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is concerned, it makes a difference which of the two it regards chiefly, the present <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> or the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is lost.

<p>Again, since the movement of the animal <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> holds the same place in the actions of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> movement in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things; the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is to be found by considering <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> movements. For if, in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> movements, we observe those of approach and withdrawal, approach is of itself directed to something suitable to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; while withdrawal is of itself directed to something contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; thus a heavy body, of itself, withdraws from a higher place, and approaches <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> to a lower place. But if we consider the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of both these movements, viz. gravity, then gravity itself inclines towards the lower place more than it withdraws from the higher place, since withdrawal from the latter is the reason for its downward tendency.

<p>Accordingly, since, in the movements of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, sorrow is a kind of flight or withdrawal, while pleasure is a kind of pursuit or approach; just as pleasure regards first the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> possessed, as its proper object, so sorrow regards the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that is present. On the other hand love, which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure and sorrow, regards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> rather than <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: and therefore, forasmuch as the object is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, the present <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is more properly the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sorrow or pain, than the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is lost.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The loss itself of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is apprehended as an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, just as the loss of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is apprehended as a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: and in this sense <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says that pain results from the loss of temporal goods.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Pleasure and its contrary pain have the same object, but under contrary aspects: because if the presence of a particular thin be the object of pleasure, the absence of that same thing is the object of sorrow. Now one contrary includes the privation of the other, as stated in Metaph. x, 4: and consequently sorrow in respect of one contrary is, in a way, directed to the same thing under a contrary aspect.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> When many movements arise from one <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, it does not follow that they all regard chiefly that which the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> regards chiefly, but only the first of them. And each of the others regards chiefly that which is suitable to it according to its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether desire is a cause of sorrow?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that desire is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pain or sorrow. Because sorrow of itself regards <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>): whereas desire is a movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now movement towards one contrary is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of movement towards the other contrary. Therefore desire is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pain.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, pain, according to <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. ii, 12), is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by something present; whereas the object of desire is something future. Therefore desire is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pain.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that which is pleasant in itself is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pain. But desire is pleasant in itself, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. i, 11). Therefore desire is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pain or sorrow.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion xxiv): "When <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of things <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to be done, and desire of things hurtful, found their way in: <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and pain stole an entrance in their company." But <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. Therefore desire is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sorrow.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Sorrow is a movement of the animal <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Now, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> movement is likened to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; a likeness, that may be assigned to a twofold <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; one, on the part of the end, the other, on the part of the principle of movement. Thus, on the part of the end, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a heavy body's downward movement is the lower place; while the principle of that movement is a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination resulting from gravity.

<p>Now the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> movement, on the part of the end, is the object of that movement. And thus, it has been said above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>) that the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pain or sorrow is a present <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. On the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, by way or principle, of that movement, is the inward inclination of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; which inclination regards, first of all, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and in consequence, the rejection of a contrary <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Hence the first principle of this <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> movement is love, which is the first inclination of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> towards the possession of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: while the second principle is <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, which is the first inclination of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> towards the avoidance of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But since <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> or desire is the first effect of love, which gives rise to the greatest pleasure, as stated above (Question 32, Article 6); hence it is that <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> often speaks of desire or <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> in the sense of love, as was also stated (30, 2, ad 2): and in this sense he says that desire is the universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sorrow. Sometimes, however, desire taken in its proper sense, is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sorrow. Because whatever hinders a movement from reaching its end is contrary to that movement. Now that which is contrary to the movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sorrow. Consequently, desire becomes a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sorrow, in so far as we sorrow for the delay of a desired <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, or for its entire removal. But it cannot be a universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sorrow: since we sorrow more for the loss of present <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, in which we have already taken pleasure, than for the withdrawal of future <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which we desire to have.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The inclination of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> to the possession of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the inclination of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> to fly from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as stated above. And hence it is that the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> movements that regard <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, are reckoned as <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> movements that regard <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> That which is desired, though really future, is, nevertheless, in a way, present, inasmuch as it is hoped for. Or we may say that although the desired <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> itself is future, yet the hindrance is reckoned as present, and so gives rise to sorrow.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Desire gives pleasure, so long as there is hope of obtaining that which is desired. But, when hope is removed through the presence of an obstacle, desire <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> sorrow.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the craving for unity is a cause of sorrow?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the craving for unity is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sorrow. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. x, 3) that "this opinion," which held repletion to be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure, and division [<a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> wrote <em>endeian</em>, 'want'; <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> version, read 'incisionem'; should he have read 'indigentiam'?], the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sorrow, "seems to have originated in pains and pleasures connected with food." But not every pleasure or sorrow is of this kind. Therefore the craving for unity is not the universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sorrow; since repletion pertains to unity, and division is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of multitude.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every separation is opposed to unity. If therefore sorrow were <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by a craving for unity, no separation would be pleasant: and this is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a> as regards the separation of whatever is superfluous.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, for the same reason we desire the conjunction of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and the removal of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But as conjunction regards unity, since it is a kind of union; so separation is contrary to unity. Therefore the craving for unity should not be reckoned, rather than the craving for separation, as <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> sorrow.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Lib. Arb. iii, 23), that "from the pain that dumb animals feel, it is quite evident how their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> desire unity, in ruling and quickening their bodies. For what else is pain but a feeling of impatience of division or corruption?"

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Forasmuch as the desire or craving for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is reckoned as a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sorrow, so must a craving for unity, and love, be accounted as <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> sorrow. Because the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of each thing consists in a certain unity, inasmuch as each thing has, united in itself, the elements of which its perfection consists: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a> held that "one" is a principle, just as "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" is. Hence everything <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> desires unity, just as it desires <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>: and therefore, just as love or desire for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sorrow, so also is the love or craving for unity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Not every kind of union <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, but only that on which the perfect being of a thing depends. Hence neither does the desire of any kind of unity <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> pain or sorrow, as some have maintained: whose opinion is refuted by the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> from the fact that repletion is not always pleasant; for instance, when a man has eaten to repletion, he takes no further pleasure in eating; because repletion or union of this kind, is repugnant rather than conducive to perfect being. Consequently sorrow is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the craving, not for any kind of unity, but for that unity in which the perfection of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> consists.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Separation can be pleasant, either because it removes something contrary to a thing's perfection, or because it has some union connected with it, such as union of the sense to its object.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Separation from things hurtful and corruptive is desired, in so far as they destroy the unity which is due. Wherefore the desire for such like separation is not the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sorrow, whereas the craving for unity is.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether an irresistible power is a cause of sorrow?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a greater power should not be reckoned a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sorrow. For that which is in the power of the agent is not present but future. But sorrow is for present <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore a greater power is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sorrow.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, hurt inflicted is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sorrow. But hurt can be inflicted even by a lesser power. Therefore a greater power should not be reckoned as a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sorrow.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the interior inclinations of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of the movements of <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. But a greater power is something external. Therefore it should not be reckoned as a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sorrow.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Nat. Boni xx): "Sorrow in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> resisting a stronger power: while pain in the body is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by sense resisting a stronger body."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), a present <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sorrow or pain, by way of object. Therefore that which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> being present, should be reckoned as <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> pain or sorrow. Now it is evident that it is contrary to the inclination of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> to be united with a present <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: and whatever is contrary to a thing's inclination does not happen to it save by the action of something stronger. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> reckons a greater power as being the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sorrow.

<p>But it must be noted that if the stronger power goes so far as to transform the contrary inclination into its own inclination there will be no longer repugnance or <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>: thus if a stronger agent, by its action on a heavy body, deprives it of its downward tendency, its consequent upward tendency is not <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> but <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to it.

<p>Accordingly if some greater power prevail so far as to take away from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> or the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, their respective inclinations, pain or sorrow will not result therefrom; such is the result only when the contrary inclination of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> remains. And hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Nat. Boni xx) that sorrow is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> "resisting a stronger power": for were it not to resist, but to yield by consenting, the result would be not sorrow but pleasure.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A greater power <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> sorrow, as acting not <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a> but actually, i.e. by <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> the actual presence of the corruptive <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Nothing hinders a power which is not simply greater, from being greater in some respect: and accordingly it is able to inflict some harm. But if it be nowise stronger, it can do no harm at all: wherefore it cannot bring about that which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> sorrow.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> External agents can be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> movements, in so far as they <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the presence of the object: and it is thus that a greater power is reckoned to be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sorrow.
