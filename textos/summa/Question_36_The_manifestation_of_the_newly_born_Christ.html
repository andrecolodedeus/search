<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether Christ's birth should have been made known to all?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth should have been made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all. Because fulfilment should correspond to promise. Now, the promise of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> coming is thus expressed (<a href="../bible/psa049.htm#verse3">Psalm 49:3</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall come manifestly. But He came by His birth in the flesh." Therefore it seems that His birth should have been made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the whole world.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse15">1 Timothy 1:15</a>): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> came into this world to save sinners." But this is not effected save in as far as the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to them; according to <a href="../bible/tit002.htm#verse11">Titus 2:11-12</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> our Saviour hath appeared to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, instructing us, that denying ungodliness and worldly desires, we should live soberly, and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>, and godly in this world." Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth should have been made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is most especially inclined to mercy; according to <a href="../bible/psa144.htm#verse9">Psalm 144:9</a>: "His tender mercies are over all His works." But in His second coming, when He will "judge justices" (<a href="../bible/psa070.htm#verse3">Psalm 70:3</a>), He will come before the eyes of all; according to <a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse27">Matthew 24:27</a>: "As lightning cometh out of the east, and appeareth even into the west, so shall also the coming of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> be." Much more, therefore, should His first coming, when He was born into the world according to the flesh, have been made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/isa045.htm#verse15">Isaiah 45:15</a>): "Thou art a hidden <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Holy [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>] of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the Saviour." And, again (<a href="../bible/isa043.htm#verse3">Isaiah 43:3</a>): "His look was, as it were, hidden and despised."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It was unfitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth should be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> without distinction. First, because this would have been a hindrance to the redemption of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, which was accomplished by means of the Cross; for, as it is written (<a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse8">1 Corinthians 2:8</a>): "If they had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> it, they would never have crucified the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>."

<p>Secondly, because this would have lessened the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which He came to offer men as the way to righteousness. according to <a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse22">Romans 3:22</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>." For if, when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was born, His birth had been made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all by evident signs, the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> would have been destroyed, since it is "the evidence of things that appear not," as stated, <a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse1">Hebrews 11:1</a>.

<p>Thirdly, because thus the reality of His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> would have come into <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. Whence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. ad Volusianum cxxxvii): "If He had not passed through the different stages of age from babyhood to youth, had neither eaten nor slept, would He not have strengthened an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> opinion, and made it impossible for us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He had become <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>? And while He is doing all things wondrously, would He have taken away that which He accomplished in mercy?"

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a>, the words quoted must be understood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> coming as judge.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> All men were to be instructed unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, concerning the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> our Saviour, not at the very time of His birth, but afterwards, in due time, after He had "wrought <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in the midst of the earth" (<a href="../bible/psa073.htm#verse12">Psalm 73:12</a>). Wherefore after His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> and <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, He said to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> (<a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew 28:19</a>): "Going . . . teach ye all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> For judgment to be passed, the authority of the judge needs to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>: and for this reason it behooves that the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> unto judgment should be manifest. But His first coming was unto the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of all, which is by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that is of things not seen. And therefore it was fitting that His first coming should be hidden.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether Christ's birth should have been made known to some?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth should not have been made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to anyone. For, as stated above (1, ad 3), it befitted the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> first coming should be hidden. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> came to save all; according to <a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse10">1 Timothy 4:10</a>: "Who is the Saviour of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, especially of the faithful." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth should not have been made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to anyone.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was born, His future birth was made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> and <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>. Therefore it was not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that it should be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to others after His birth.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> makes <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that from which arise disturbance and harm to others. But, when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth was made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, disturbance arose: for it is written (<a href="../bible/mat002.htm#verse3">Matthew 2:3</a>) that "King Herod, hearing" of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth, "was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him." Moreover, this brought harm to others; because it was the occasion of Herod's killing "all the male children that were in Bethlehem . . . from two years old and under." Therefore it seems unfitting for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth to have been made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to anyone.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth would have been profitable to none if it had been hidden from all. But it behooved <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth to be profitable: else He were born in vain. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth should have been made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to some.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse1">Romans 13:1</a>) "what is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is well ordered." Now it belongs to the order of Divine wisdom that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> and the secrets of His wisdom are not bestowed on all equally, but to some immediately, through whom they are made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to others. Wherefore, with regard to the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">mystery of the Resurrection</a> it is written (<a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse40">Acts 10:40-41</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> . . . gave" Christ rising again "to be made manifest, not to all the people, but to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> pre-ordained by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Consequently, that His birth might be consistent with this, it should have been made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, not to all, but to some, through whom it could be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As it would have been prejudicial to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> birth had been made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, so also would it have been if none had been informed of it. Because in either case <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is destroyed, whether a thing be perfectly manifest, or whether it be entirely unknown, so that no one can hear it from another; for "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> cometh by hearing" (<a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse17">Romans 10:17</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Mary and <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> needed to be instructed concerning <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth before He was born, because it devolved on them to show reverence to the child conceived in the womb, and to serve Him even before He was born. But their testimony, being of a domestic character, would have aroused suspicion in regard to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> greatness: and so it behooved it to be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to others, whose testimony could not be suspect.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The very disturbance that arose when it was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was born was becoming to His birth. First, because thus the heavenly dignity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is made manifest. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. x in Evang.): "After the birth of the King of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, the earthly king is troubled: doubtless because earthly grandeur is covered with confusion when the heavenly majesty is revealed."

<p>Secondly, thereby the judicial power of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was foreshadowed. Thus <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a sermon (30 de Temp.) on the Epiphany: "What will He be like in the judgment-seat; since from His cradle He struck terror into the heart of a <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> king?"

<p>Thirdly, because thus the overthrow of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> kingdom was foreshadowed. For, as Pope Leo says in a sermon on the Epiphany (Serm. v [Opus Imperfectum in Matth., Hom. ii, <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>): "Herod was not so much troubled in himself as the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> in Herod. For Herod thought Him to be a man, but the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> thought Him to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Each feared a successor to his kingdom: the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, a heavenly successor; Herod, an earthly successor." But their fear was needless: since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had not come to set up an earthly kingdom, as Pope Leo says, addressing himself to Herod: "Thy palace cannot hold Christ: nor is the Lord of the world content with the paltry power of thy scepter." That the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> were troubled, who, on the contrary, should have rejoiced, was either because, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says, "<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men could not rejoice at the coming of the Holy one," or because they wished to court favor with Herod, whom they feared; for "the populace is inclined to favor too much those whose cruelty it endures."

<p>And that the children were slain by Herod was not harmful to them, but profitable. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a sermon on the Epiphany (66 de Diversis): "It cannot be questioned that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who came to set <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> free, rewarded those who were slain for Him; since, while hanging on the cross, He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for those who were putting Him to death."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether those to whom Christ's birth was made known were suitably chosen?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that those to whom <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth was made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> were not suitably chosen. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse5">Matthew 10:5</a>) commanded His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, "Go ye not into the way of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>," so that He might be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> before the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. Therefore it seems that much less should <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth have been at once revealed to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> who "came from the east," as stated <a href="../bible/mat002.htm#verse1">Matthew 2:1</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> of Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> should be made especially to the friends of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/job036.htm#verse33">Job 36:33</a>: "He sheweth His friend concerning it." But the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> seem to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> foes; for it is written (<a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse31">Leviticus 19:31</a>): "Go not aside after wizards [magi], neither ask anything of soothsayers." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth should not have been made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> came in order to set free the whole world from the power of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; whence it is written (<a href="../bible/mal001.htm#verse11">Malachi 1:11</a>): "From the rising of the sun even to the going down, My name is great among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>." Therefore He should have been made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, not only to those who dwelt in the east, but also to some from all parts of the world.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> were figures of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> were dispensed through the ministry of the legal <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth should have been made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> rather to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the Temple than to the shepherds in the fields.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was born of a <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin-Mother</a>, and was as yet a little child. It was therefore more suitable that He should be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to youths and <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> than to old and <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> people or to <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, such as Simeon and Anna.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse18">John 13:18</a>): "I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whom I have chosen." But what is done by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> wisdom is done becomingly. Therefore those to whom <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth was made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> were suitably chosen.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Salvation, which was to be accomplished by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, concerns all sorts and <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: because, as it is written (<a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse11">Colossians 3:11</a>), in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> "there is neither male nor female, [These words are in reality from <a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse28">Galatians 3:28</a>] neither <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> nor <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jew</a> . . . bond nor free," and so forth. And in order that this might be foreshadowed in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth, He was made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of all conditions. Because, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a sermon on the Epiphany (32 de Temp.), "the shepherds were Israelites, the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> were <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. The former were nigh to Him, the latter far from Him. Both hastened to Him together as to the cornerstone." There was also another point of contrast: for the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> were wise and powerful; the shepherds simple and lowly. He was also made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the righteous as Simeon and Anna; and to sinners, as the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>. He was made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> both to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>--namely, to Anna--so as to show no <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to be excluded from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> redemption.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> That manifestation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth was a kind of foretaste of the full manifestation which was to come. And as in the later manifestation the first announcement of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was made by Him and His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> and afterwards to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, so the first to come to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> were the shepherds, who were the first-fruits of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, as being near to Him; and afterwards came the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> from afar, who were "the first-fruits of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Serm. 30 de Temp. cc.).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a sermon on the Epiphany (Serm. 30 de Temp.): "As unskilfulness predominates in the rustic manners of the shepherd, so ungodliness abounds in the profane rites of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>. Yet did this Corner-Stone draw both to Itself; inasmuch as He came 'to choose the foolish things that He might confound the wise,' and 'not to call the just, but sinners,'" so that "the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> might not boast, nor the weak <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>." Nevertheless, there are those who say that these <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> were not wizards, but wise <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomers</a>, who are called <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> among the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a> or Chaldees.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says [Hom. ii in Matth. in the Opus Imperf., among the supposititious works of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>]: "The <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> came from the east, because the first beginning of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> came from the land where the day is born; since <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the light of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>." Or, "because all who come to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> come from Him and through Him": whence it is written (<a href="../bible/zec006.htm#verse12">Zechariah 6:12</a>): "Behold a Man, the Orient is His name." Now, they are said to come from the east literally, either because, as some say, they came from the farthest parts of the east, or because they came from the neighboring parts of Judea that lie to the east of the region inhabited by the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>. Yet it is to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that certain signs of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth appeared also in other parts of the world: thus, at Rome the river flowed with oil [<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, Chronic. II, Olymp. 185]; and in Spain three suns were seen, which gradually merged into one [Cf. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, Chronic. II, Olymp. 184].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> observes (Theophylact., Enarr. in Luc. ii, 8), the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who announced <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth did not go to Jerusalem, nor did he seek the Scribes and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, for they were corrupted, and full of ill-will. But the shepherds were single-minded, and were like the patriarchs and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in their mode of life. Moreover, these shepherds were types of the Doctors of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to whom are revealed the mysteries of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> that were hidden from the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (on <a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse25">Luke 2:25</a>): "It was right that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> birth should be attested not only by the shepherds, but also by people advanced in age and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>": whose testimony is rendered the more credible by reason of their righteousness.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether Christ Himself should have made His birth know?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should have Himself made His birth <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. For "a direct <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is always of greater power than an indirect <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>," as is stated Phys. viii. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> made His birth <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through others--for instance, to the shepherds through the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> through the star. Much more, therefore, should He Himself have made His birth <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/sir020.htm#verse32">Sirach 20:32</a>): "Wisdom that is hid and treasure that is not seen; what profit is there in them both?" But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had, to perfection, the treasure of wisdom and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> from the beginning of His conception. Therefore, unless He had made the fulness of these <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by words and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, wisdom and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> would have been given Him to no purpose. But this is unreasonable: because "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> do nothing without a purpose" (De Coelo i).

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, we read in the book De Infantia Salvatoris that in His infancy <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> worked many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. It seems therefore that He did Himself make His birth <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Pope Leo says (Serm. xxxiv) that the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> found the "infant <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> in no way different from the generality of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> infants." But other infants do not make themselves <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Therefore it was not fitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should Himself make His birth <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth was ordered unto <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, which is by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But saving <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> confesses Christ's Godhead and humanity. It behooved, therefore, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth to be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in such a way that the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of His Godhead should not be prejudicial to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But this took place while <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> presented a likeness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness, and yet, by means of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> creatures, He showed the power of the Godhead in Himself. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> made His birth <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, not by Himself, but by means of certain other creatures.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> By the way of generation and movement we must of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> come to the imperfect before the perfect. And therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> first through other creatures, and afterwards He Himself manifested Himself perfectly.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although hidden wisdom is useless, yet there is no need for a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to make himself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> at all times, but at a suitable time; for it is written (<a href="../bible/sir020.htm#verse6">Sirach 20:6</a>): "There is one that holdeth his peace because he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> not what to say: and there is another that holdeth his peace, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the proper time." Hence the wisdom given to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not useless, because at a suitable time He manifested Himself. And the very fact that He was hidden at a suitable time is a sign of wisdom.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The book De Infantia Salvatoris is <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a>. Moreover, <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> (Hom. xxi super Joan.) says that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> worked no <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> before changing the water into wine, according to <a href="../bible/joh002.htm#verse11">John 2:11</a>: "'This beginning of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> did <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>.' For if He had worked <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> at an early age, there would have been no need for anyone else to manifest Him to Israelites; whereas <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a> says (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse31">John 1:31</a>): 'That He may be made manifest in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; therefore am I come <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> with water.' Moreover, it was fitting that He should not begin to work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> at an early age. For people would have thought <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> to be unreal, and, out of sheer spite, would have crucified Him before the proper time."

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether Christ's birth should have been manifested by means of the angels and the star?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth should not have been manifested by means of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa103.htm#verse4">Psalm 103:4</a>: "Who maketh His [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'makest Thy'] <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, spirits." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth was in the flesh, and not in His <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Therefore it should not have been manifested by means of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the righteous are more akin to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> than to any other, according to <a href="../bible/psa033.htm#verse8">Psalm 33:8</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord shall encamp round about them that fear Him, and shall deliver them." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth was not announced to the righteous, viz. Simeon and Anna, through the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Therefore neither should it have been announced to the shepherds by means of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it seems that neither ought it to have been announced to the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> by means of the star. For this seems to favor the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of those who think that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> birth is influenced by the stars. But occasions of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> should be taken away from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore it was not fitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth should be announced by a star.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, a sign should be certain, in order that something be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> thereby. But a star does not seem to be a certain sign of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth was not suitably announced by a star.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse4">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>): "The works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are perfect." But this manifestation is the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore it was accomplished by means of suitable signs.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is imparted through a syllogism from something which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> better, so <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> given by signs must be conveyed through things which are familiar to those to whom the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is imparted. Now, it is clear that the righteous have, through the spirit of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, a certain familiarity with the interior instinct of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and are wont to be taught thereby, without the guidance of sensible signs. Whereas others, occupied with material things, are led through the domain of the senses to that of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, however, were accustomed to receive Divine answers through the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; through whom they also received the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, according to <a href="../bible/act007.htm#verse53">Acts 7:53</a>: "You [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'who'] . . . have received the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> by the disposition of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>." And the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, especially astrologers, were wont to observe the course of the stars. And therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth was made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the righteous, viz. Simeon and Anna, by the interior instinct of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, according to <a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse26">Luke 2:26</a>: "He had received an answer from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> that he should not see death before he had seen the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> of the Lord." But to the shepherds and <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>, as being occupied with material things, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth was made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by means of visible apparitions. And since this birth was not only earthly, but also, in a way, heavenly, to both (shepherds and <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>) it is revealed through heavenly signs: for, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a sermon on the Epiphany (cciv): "The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> inhabit, and the stars adorn, the heavens: by both, therefore, do the 'heavens show forth the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.'" Moreover, it was not without reason that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth was made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, by means of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, to the shepherds, who, being <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, were accustomed to frequent apparitions of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>: whereas it was revealed by means of a star to the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>, who were wont to consider the heavenly bodies. Because, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. vi in Matth.): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> deigned to call them through things to which they were accustomed." There is also another reason. For, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. x in Evang.): "To the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, as rational beings, it was fitting that a rational animal [Cf. I, 51, 1, ad 2]," viz. an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, "should preach. Whereas the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, who were unable to come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through the reason, were led to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not by words, but by signs. And as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>, when He was able to speak, was announced by heralds who spoke, so before He could speak He was manifested by speechless elements." Again, there is yet another reason. For, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [Pope Leo] says in a sermon on the Epiphany: "To <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was promised an innumerable progeny, begotten, not of carnal propagation, but of the fruitfulness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For this reason it is compared to the multitude of stars; that a heavenly progeny might be hoped for." Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, "who are thus designated by the stars, are by the rising of a new star stimulated" to seek <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, through whom they are made the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> That which of itself is hidden needs to be manifested, but not that which in itself is manifest. Now, the flesh of Him who was born was manifest, whereas the Godhead was hidden. And therefore it was fitting that this birth should be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who are the ministers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore also a certain "brightness" (<a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse9">Luke 2:9</a>) accompanied the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> apparition, to indicate that He who was just born was the "Brightness of" the Father's "<a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The righteous did not need the visible apparition of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>; on account of their perfection the interior instinct of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was enough for them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The star which manifested <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth removed all occasion of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. For, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Faust. ii): "No <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrologer</a> has ever so far connected the stars with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> fate at the time of his birth as to assert that one of the stars, at the birth of any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, left its orbit and made its way to him who was just born": as happened in the case of the star which made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Consequently this does not corroborate the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of those who "think there is a connection between <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> birth and the course of the stars, for they do not hold that the course of the stars can be changed at a man's birth."

<p>In the same sense <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. vi in Matth.): "It is not an <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer's</a> business to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from the stars those who are born, but to tell the future from the hour of a man's birth: whereas the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the time of the birth, so as to conclude therefrom some <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the future; rather was it the other way about."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> relates (Hom. ii in Matth.) that, according to some <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> books, a certain tribe in the far east near the ocean was in the possession of a document written by Seth, referring to this star and to the presents to be offered: which tribe watched attentively for the rising of this star, twelve men being appointed to take observations, who at stated times repaired to the summit of a mountain with faithful assiduity: whence they subsequently perceived the star containing the figure of a small child, and above it the form of a cross.

<p>Or we may say, as may be read in the book De Qq. Vet. et Nov. Test., qu. lxiii, that "these <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> followed the tradition of Balaam," who said, "'A star shall rise out of <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>.' Wherefore observing this star to be a stranger to the system of this world, they gathered that it was the one foretold by Balaam to indicate the King of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>."

<p>Or again, it may be said with <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, in a sermon on the Epiphany (ccclxxiv), that "the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> had received a <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> through the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>" that the star was a sign of the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: and he thinks it probable that these were "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; since in <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adoring</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> they were seeking for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>."

<p>Or with Pope Leo, in a sermon on the Epiphany (xxxiv), that "besides the outward form which aroused the attention of their corporeal eyes, a more brilliant ray enlightened their <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> with the light of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>."

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether Christ's birth was made known in a becoming order?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth was made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in an unbecoming order. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth should have been made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to them first who were nearest to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and who longed for Him most; according to <a href="../bible/wis006.htm#verse14">Wisdom 6:14</a>: "She preventeth them that covet her, so that she first showeth herself unto them." But the righteous were nearest to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and longed most for His coming; whence it is written (<a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse25">Luke 2:25</a>) of Simeon that "he was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth should have been made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to Simeon before the shepherds and <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> were the "first-fruits of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>," who were to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But first the "fulness of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> . . . come in" unto <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and afterwards "all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>" shall "be saved," as is written (<a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse25">Romans 11:25</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth should have been made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> before the shepherds.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/mat002.htm#verse16">Matthew 2:16</a>) that "Herod killed all the male children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the borders thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired from the wise men": so that it seems that the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> were two years in coming to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> after His birth. It was therefore unbecoming that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> so long after His birth.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/dan002.htm#verse21">Daniel 2:21</a>): "He changes time and ages." Consequently the time of the manifestation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth seems to have been arranged in a suitable order.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth was first made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the shepherds on the very day that He was born. For, as it is written (<a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse80">Luke 2:8-16</a>): "There were in the same country shepherds watching, and keeping the night-watches over their flock . . . And it came to pass, after the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> departed from them into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> they [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'the shepherds'] said one to another: Let us go over to Bethlehem . . . and they came with haste." Second in order were the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>, who came to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> on the thirteenth day after His birth, on which day is kept the feast of the Epiphany. For if they had come after a year, or even two years, they would not have found Him in Bethlehem, since it is written (<a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse39">Luke 2:39</a>) that "after they had performed all things according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the Lord"--that is to say, after they had offered up the Child <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> in the Temple--"they returned into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, to their city"--namely, "Nazareth." In the third place, it was made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in the Temple to the righteous on the fortieth day after His birth, as related by Luke (<a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse22">2:22</a>).

<p>The reason of this order is that the shepherds represent the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and other believers of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, to whom the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> first; among whom there were "not many mighty, not many noble," as we read <a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse26">1 Corinthians 1:26</a>. Secondly, the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> came to the "fulness of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>"; and this is foreshadowed in the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>. Thirdly it came to the fulness of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, which is foreshadowed in the righteous. Wherefore also <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was manifested to them in the Jewish Temple.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse30">Romans 9:30-31</a>): "<a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, by following after the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, is not come unto the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>": but the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, "who followed not after <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>," forestalled the generality of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> which is of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. As a figure of this, Simeon, "who was waiting for the consolation of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>," was the last to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> born: and he was preceded by the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> and the shepherds, who did not await the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> with such longing.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although the "fulness of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> came in" unto <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> before the fulness of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, yet the first-fruits of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> preceded the first-fruits of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For this reason the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the shepherds before the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There are two opinions about the apparition of the star seen by the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> (Hom. ii in Matth. [Opus Imperf. in Matth., <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>], and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> in a sermon on the Epiphany (cxxxi, cxxxii), say that the star was seen by the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> during the two years that preceded the birth of Christ: and then, having first considered the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and prepared themselves for the journey, they came from the farthest east to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, arriving on the thirteenth day after His birth. Wherefore Herod, immediately after the departure of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>, "perceiving that He was deluded by them," commanded the male children to be killed "from two years old and under," being <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> lest <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> were already born when the star appeared, according as he had heard from the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>.

<p>But others say that the star first appeared when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was born, and that the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> set off as soon as they saw the star, and accomplished a journey of very great length in thirteen days, owing partly to the Divine assistance, and partly to the fleetness of the dromedaries. And I say this on the supposition that they came from the far east. But others, again, say that they came from a neighboring country, whence also was Balaam, to whose teaching they were heirs; and they are said to have come from the east, because their country was to the east of the country of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>. In this case Herod killed the babes, not as soon as the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> departed, but two years after: and that either because he is said to have gone to Rome in the meanwhile on account of an accusation brought against him, or because he was troubled at some imminent peril, and for the time being desisted from his anxiety to slay the child, or because he may have thought that the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>, "being deceived by the illusory appearance of the star, and not finding the child, as they had expected to, were ashamed to return to him": as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Consensu Evang. ii). And the reason why he killed not only those who were two years old, but also the younger children, would be, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a sermon on <a href="../cathen/07419a.htm">Innocents</a>, because he feared lest a child whom the stars obey, might make himself appear older or younger.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the star which appeared to the Magi belonged to the heavenly system?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the star which appeared to the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> belonged to the heavenly system. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a sermon on the Epiphany (cxxii): "While <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> yet clings to the breast, and suffers Himself to be wrapped in <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> swaddling clothes, suddenly a new star shines forth in the heavens." Therefore the star which appeared to the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> belonged to the heavenly system.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a sermon on the Epiphany (cci): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the shepherds by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> by a star. A heavenly tongue speaks to both, because the tongue of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> spoke no longer." But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who appeared to the shepherds were really <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Therefore also the star which appeared to the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> was really a star from the heavens.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, stars which are not in the heavens but in the air are called comets, which do not appear at the birth of kings, but rather are signs of their approaching death. But this star was a sign of the King's birth: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat002.htm#verse2">Matthew 2:2</a>): "Where is He that is born King of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>? For we have seen His star in the east." Therefore it seems that it was a star from the heavens.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Faust. ii): "It was not one of those stars which since the beginning of the creation observe the course appointed to them by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a>; but this star was a stranger to the heavens, and made its appearance at the strange sight of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> in childbirth."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. vi in Matth.), it is clear, for many reasons, that the star which appeared to the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> did not belong to the heavenly system. First, because no other star approaches from the same quarter as this star, whose course was from north to south, these being the relative positions of Persia, whence the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> came, and Judea. Secondly, from the time [at which it was seen]. For it appeared not only at night, but also at midday: and no star can do this, not even the moon. Thirdly, because it was visible at one time and hidden at another. For when they entered Jerusalem it hid itself: then, when they had left Herod, it showed itself again. Fourthly, because its movement was not continuous, but when the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> had to continue their journey the star moved on; when they had to stop the star stood still; as happened to the pillar of a cloud in the desert. Fifthly, because it indicated the virginal Birth, not by remaining aloft, but by coming down below. For it is written (<a href="../bible/mat002.htm#verse9">Matthew 2:9</a>) that "the star which they had seen in the east went before them, until it came and stood over where the child was." Whence it is evident that the words of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>, "We have seen His star in the east," are to be taken as meaning, not that when they were in the east the star appeared over the country of Judea, but that when they saw the star it was in the east, and that it preceded them into Judea (although this is considered <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> by some). But it could not have indicated the house distinctly, unless it were near the earth. And, as he [Chrysostom] observes, this does not seem fitting to a star, but "of some power endowed with reason." Consequently "it seems that this was some invisible force made visible under the form of a star."

<p>Wherefore some say that, as the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, after <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, came down on Him under the form of a dove, so did He appear to the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> under the form of a star. While others say that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who, under a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> form, appeared to the shepherds, under the form of a star, appeared to the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>. But it seems more probable that it was a newly <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> star, not in the heavens, but in the air near the earth, and that its movement varied according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will. Wherefore Pope Leo says in a sermon on the Epiphany (xxxi): "A star of unusual brightness appeared to the three <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> in the east, which, through being more brilliant and more beautiful than the other stars, drew men's gaze and attention: so that they understood at once that such an unwonted event could not be devoid of purpose."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Scripture</a> the air is sometimes called the heavens--for instance, "The birds of the heavens [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'air'] and the fishes of the sea."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, by reason of their very office, come down to us, being "sent to minister." But the stars of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> do not change their position. Wherefore there is no comparison.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As the star did not follow the course of the heavenly stars, so neither did it follow the course of the comets, which neither appear during the daytime nor vary their customary course. Nevertheless in its signification it has something in common with the comets. Because the heavenly kingdom of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> "shall break in pieces, and shall consume all the kingdoms" of the earth, "and itself shall stand for ever" (<a href="../bible/dan002.htm#verse44">Daniel 2:44</a>).

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether it was becoming that the Magi should come to adore Christ and pay homage to Him?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it was unbecoming that the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> should come to <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> Christ and pay homage to Him. For reverence is due to a king from his subjects. But the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> did not belong to the kingdom of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>. Therefore, since they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> by seeing the star that He that was born was the "King of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>," it seems unbecoming that they should come to <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> Him.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it seems absurd during the reign of one king to proclaim a stranger. But in Judea Herod was reigning. Therefore it was foolish of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> to proclaim the birth of a king.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a heavenly sign is more <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> than a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> sign. But the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> had come to Judea from the east, under the guidance of a heavenly sign. Therefore it was foolish of them to seek <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> guidance besides that of the star, saying: "Where is He that is born King of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>?"

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the offering of <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> and the homage of adoration are not due save to kings already reigning. But the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> did not find <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> resplendent with kingly grandeur. Therefore it was unbecoming for them to offer Him <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> and homage.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/isa060.htm#verse3">Isaiah 60:3</a>): "[The <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>] shall walk in the light, and kings in the brightness of thy rising." But those who walk in the Divine light do not <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> were right in offering homage to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (3, ad 1), the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> are the "first-fruits of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>" that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; because their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was a presage of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and devotion of the nations who were to come to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> from afar. And therefore, as the devotion and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the nations is without any <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> through the inspiration of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, so also we must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>, inspired by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, did wisely in paying homage to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a sermon on the Epiphany (cc.): "Though many kings of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> had been born and died, none of them did the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> seek to <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a>. And so they who came from a distant foreign land to a kingdom that was entirely strange to them, had no <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of showing such great homage to such a king as the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> were wont to have. But they had learnt that such a King was born that by <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adoring</a> Him they might be sure of obtaining from Him the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> which is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> By proclaiming [<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> King] the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> foreshadowed the constancy of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> in confessing Christ even until death. Whence <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. ii in Matth.) that, while they thought of the King who was to come, the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> feared not the king who was actually present. They had not yet seen <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and they were already prepared to die for Him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a sermon on the Epiphany (cc.): "The star which led the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> to the place where the Divine Infant was with His Virgin-Mother could bring them to the town of Bethlehem, in which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was born. Yet it hid itself until the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> also bore testimony of the city in which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was to be born: so that, being encouraged by a twofold witness," as Pope Leo says (Serm. xxxiv), "they might seek with more ardent <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> Him, whom both the brightness of the star and the authority of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> revealed." Thus they "proclaim" that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is born, and "inquire where; they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and ask, as it were, betokening those who walk by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and desire to see," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a sermon on the Epiphany (cxcix). But the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, by indicating to them the place of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth, "are like the carpenters who built the <a href="../cathen/01720a.htm">Ark of Noah</a>, who provided others with the means of escape, and themselves perished in the flood. Those who asked, heard and went their way: the teachers spoke and stayed where they were; like the milestones that point out the way but walk not" (<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, Serm. cclxxiii). It was also by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will that, when they no longer saw the star, the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>, by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a>, went to Jerusalem, to seek in the royal city the new-born King, in order that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth might be publicly proclaimed first in Jerusalem, according to <a href="../bible/isa002.htm#verse3">Isaiah 2:3</a>: "The Law shall come forth from Sion, and the Word of the Lord from Jerusalem"; and also "in order that by the zeal of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> who came from afar, the indolence of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> who lived near at hand, might be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> worthy of condemnation" (Remig., Hom. in Matth. ii, 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. ii in Matth. [From the supposititious Opus Imperfectum): "If the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> had come in search of an earthly King, they would have been disconcerted at finding that they had taken the trouble to come such a long way for nothing. Consequently they would have neither <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> nor offered <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>. But since they sought a heavenly King, though they found in Him no signs of royal pre-eminence, yet, content with the testimony of the star alone, they <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a>: for they saw a man, and they acknowledged a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Moreover, they offer <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> in keeping with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> greatness: "gold, as to the great King; they offer up <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> as to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because it is used in the Divine Sacrifice; and myrrh, which is used in embalming the bodies of the dead, is offered as to Him who is to die for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of all" (<a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, Hom. x in Evang.). And hereby, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. x in Evang.), we are taught to offer gold, "which signifies wisdom, to the new-born King, by the luster of our wisdom in His sight." We offer <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, "which signifies fervor in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, if our constant <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> mount up to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with an odor of sweetness"; and we offer myrrh, "which signifies mortification of the flesh, if we mortify the ill-deeds of the flesh by refraining from them."
