<h1>Question 36. The qualities required of those who receive this sacrament</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5036.htm#article1"> Is goodness of life required of those who receive this sacrament?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5036.htm#article2"> Is the knowledge of the whole of Sacred Writ required?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5036.htm#article3"> Is the degree of Orders obtained by mere merit of life?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5036.htm#article4"> Does he sin who raises the unworthy to Orders?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5036.htm#article5"> Can one who is in sin without committing a sin exercise the Order he has received?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether goodness of life is required of those who receive Orders?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of life is not required of those who receive Orders. For by Orders a man is ordained to the dispensation of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> can be administered by <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of life is not requisite.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> is no greater than service offered to Him in the body. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> did not cast aside the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> and <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> from rendering Him a bodily service (<a href="../bible/luk007.htm">Luke 7</a>). Therefore neither should the like be debarred from His service in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, by every <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> a remedy is given against <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now those who are in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> should not be refused a remedy that may avail them. Since then <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is given in the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacrament of order</a>, it would seem that this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> ought also to be conferred on sinners.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> "Whosoever of the seed of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> throughout their families hath a blemish, he shall not offer bread to his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> neither shall he approach to minister to him [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Say to <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>: Whosoever of thy seed,'etc.]" (<a href="../bible/lev021.htm#verse17">Leviticus 21:17-18</a>). Now "blemish signifies all kinds of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>" according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a>. Therefore he who is shackled by any <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> should not be admitted to the ministry of Orders.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> commenting on the words of <a href="../bible/tit002.htm#verse15">Titus 2:15</a>, "Let no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> despise thee," says that "not only should <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> take very great care to be examples of speech and conduct to those over whom they are placed, but also the lower grades, and without exception all who serve the household of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since it is most disastrous to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> if the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> be better than the clergy." Therefore <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of life is requisite in all the Orders.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. iii), "even as the more subtle and clear <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essences</a>, being filled by the outpouring of the solar radiance, like the sun enlighten other bodies with their brilliant light, so in all things pertaining to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> a man must not dare to become a leader of others, unless in all his <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> he be most deiform and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">godlike</a>." Wherefore, since in every order a man is appointed to lead others in Divine things, he who being conscious of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> presents himself for Orders is guilty of presumption and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally. Consequently <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of life is requisite for Orders, as a matter of precept, but not as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the sacrament; and if a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be ordained, he receives the Order none the less, and yet with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> withal.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Just as the sinner dispenses <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> validly, so does he receive validly the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacrament of Orders</a>, and as he dispenses unworthily, even so he receives unworthily.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The service in point consisted only in the exercise of bodily homage, which even sinners can offer lawfully. It is different with the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> service to which the ordained are appointed, because thereby they are made to stand between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the people. Wherefore they should shine with a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and with a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> name before men.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Certain medicines require a robust constitution, else it is mortally dangerous to take them; others can be given to the weakly. So too in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things certain <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are ordained as remedies for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and the like are to be given to sinners, as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> and Penance, while others, which confer the perfection of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, require a man made strong by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether knowledge of all Holy Writ is required?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> is required. For one from whose lips we seek the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, should have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> seek the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> at the mouth of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> (<a href="../bible/mal002.htm#verse7">Malachi 2:7</a>). Therefore he should have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "being always ready to satisfy everyone that asketh you a reason of that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope in you [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Of that hope which is in you; <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> apparently took his reading from <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>]." Now to give a reason for things pertaining to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope belongs to those who have perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>. Therefore the like <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> should be possessed by those who are placed in Orders, and to whom the aforesaid words are addressed.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no one is competent to read what he understands not, since to read without <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> is "negligence,"* as Cato declares (Rudiment.). ["Legere et non intelligere est negligere." The play on the words is more evident in <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a>.] Now it belongs to the reader (which is the lower Order) to read the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 24). Therefore he should understand the whole of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>; and much more those in the higher Orders.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Many are raised to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> even who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing at all of these things, even in many religious Orders. Therefore apparently this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not required.

<p>Further, we read in the Lives of the Fathers that some who were <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were raised to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, being of a most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> life. Therefore the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not required in those to be ordained.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> For any <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a> to be rightly ordered there must needs be the direction of reason. Wherefore in order that a man exercise the office of an Order, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for him to have as much <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as suffices for his direction in the act of that Order. And consequently one who is to be raised to Orders is required to have that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and to be instructed in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Sacred Scripture</a>, not the whole, but more or less, according as his office is of a greater or lesser extent--to wit, that those who are placed over others, and receive the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> things pertaining to the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and morals, and that others <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whatever concerns the exercise of their Order.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> exercises a twofold action: the one, which is principal, over the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body of Christ; the other, which is secondary, over the <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">mystical body of Christ</a>. The second act depends on the first, but not conversely. Wherefore some are raised to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, to whom the first act alone is deputed, for instance those religious who are not empowered with the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is not sought at the mouth of these, they are required only for the celebration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>; and consequently it is enough for them to have such <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as enables them to observe rightly those things that regard the celebration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Others are raised to exercise the other act which is over the <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">mystical body of Christ</a>, and it is at the mouth of these that the people seek the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; wherefore they ought to possess <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, not indeed to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all the difficult points of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> (for in these they should have recourse to their superiors), but to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what the people have to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and fulfill in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. To the higher <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, namely the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, it belongs to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> even those points of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> which may offer some difficulty, and to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them the more perfectly according as they are in a higher position.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The reason that we have to give for our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope does not denote one that suffices to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope, since they are both of things invisible; it means that we should be able to give general <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of the probability of both, and for this there is not much need of great <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The reader has not to explain <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> to the people (for this belongs to the higher orders), but merely to voice the words. Therefore he is not required to have so much <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as to understand <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>, but only to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to pronounce it correctly. And since such <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is obtained easily and from many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, it may be supposed with probability that the ordained will acquire that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> even if he have it not already, especially if it appear that he is on the road to acquire it.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether a man obtains the degrees of Order by the merit of one's life?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a man obtains the degrees of order by the mere <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of his life. For, according to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> [Hom. xliii in the Opus Imperfectum, wrongly ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>], "not every <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, but every <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> is a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>." Now a man becomes a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> by the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of his life. Consequently he thereby also becomes a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and "a fortiori" has he the other Orders.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things, men obtain a higher degree from the very fact that they are near <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and have a greater share of His favors, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. iv). Now it is by <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that a man approaches nearer to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and receives more of His favors. Therefore by this alone he is raised to the degree of Orders.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Holiness once possessed can be lost. But when once a man is ordained he never loses his order. Therefore order does not consist in the mere <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> should be proportionate to its effect. And consequently as in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, from Whom <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> comes down on all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, there must needs be fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; so in the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to whom it belongs, not to give <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but to give the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, the degree of order does not result from their having <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but from their participating in a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> is speaking of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in reference to the reason for which he is so called, the word "sacerdos" signifying dispenser of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things [sacra dans]: for in this sense every righteous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in so far as he assists others by the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, may be called a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. But he is not speaking according to the actual meaning of the words; for this word "sacerdos" [<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>] is employed to signify one who gives sacred things by dispensing the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Natural things acquire a degree of superiority over others, from the fact that they are able to act on them by virtue of their form; wherefore from the very fact that they have a higher form, they obtain a higher degree. But the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are placed over others, not to confer anything on them by virtue of their own <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> (for this belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone), but as ministers, and as instruments, so to say, of the outpouring from the Head to the members. Hence the comparison fails as regards the dignity of Order, although it applies as to congruity.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether he who raises the unworthy to Orders commits a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that he who raises the unworthy to orders commits no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> needs assistants appointed to the lesser offices. But he would be unable to find them in sufficient number, if he were to require of them such qualifications as the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> enumerate. Therefore if he raise some who are not qualified, he would seem to be excusable.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> needs not only ministers for the dispensation of things <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, but also for the supervision of temporalities. But sometimes men without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of life may be useful for the conduct of temporal affairs, either because of their worldly power, or on account of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> industry. Therefore seemingly the like can be promoted without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, everyone is bound to avoid <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as far as he can. If therefore a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in promoting the unworthy, he is bound to take the utmost pains to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether those who present themselves for Orders be worthy, by making a careful inquiry about their morals and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and yet seemingly this is not done anywhere.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is worse to raise the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> to the sacred ministry, than not to correct those who are raised already. But Heli <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> mortally by not correcting his sons for their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; wherefore "he fell backwards . . . and died" (<a href="../bible/1sa004.htm#verse18">1 Samuel 4:18</a>). Therefore he who promotes the unworthy does not escape <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things must be set before temporal things in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Now a man would commit a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> were he knowingly to endanger the temporalities of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Much more therefore is it a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to endanger <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things. But whoever promotes the unworthy endangers <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, since according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Hom. xii in Evang.) "if a man's life is contemptible, his preaching is liable to be despised"; and for the same reason all the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things that he dispenses. Therefore he who promotes the unworthy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> describes the faithful servant whom He has set "over His household to give them their measure of wheat." Hence he is guilty of unfaithfulness who gives any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> Divine things above his measure: and whoso promotes the unworthy does this. Wherefore he commits a mortal crime, as being unfaithful to his sovereign Lord, especially since this is detrimental to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and to the Divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> which is promoted by <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> ministers. For a man would be unfaithful to his earthly lord were he to place unworthy subjects in his offices.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> never so abandons His Church that apt ministers are not to be found sufficient for the needs of the people, if the worthy be promoted and the unworthy set aside. And though it were impossible to find as many ministers as there are now, it were better to have few <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> ministers than many bad ones, as the blessed Clement declares in his second epistle to <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James</a> the <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brother of the Lord</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Temporal things are not to be sought but for the sake of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things. Wherefore all temporal advantage should count for nothing, and all gain be despised for the advancement of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is at least required that the ordainer <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that nothing contrary to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> is in the candidate for ordination. But besides this he is required to take the greatest care, in proportion to the Order or office to be enjoined, so as to be certain of the qualifications of those to be promoted, at least from the testification of others. This is the meaning of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> when he says (<a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse22">1 Timothy 5:22</a>): "Impose not hands lightly on any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>."

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether a man who is in sin can without sin exercise the Order he has received? [Cf. III, 64, 6]</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one who is in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> exercise the order he has received. For since, by virtue of his office, he is bound to exercise his order, he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> if he fails to do so. If therefore he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by exercising it, he cannot avoid <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: which is inadmissible.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> is a relaxation of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Therefore although by rights it would be unlawful for him to exercise the order he has received, it would be lawful for him to do so by dispensation.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whoever co-operates with another in a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally. If therefore a sinner <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally by exercising his order, he who receives or demands any Divine thing from him also <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally: and this seems absurd.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, if he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by exercising his order, it follows that every act of his order that he performs is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and consequently since many acts concur in the one exercise of his order, it would seem that he commits many mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: which seems very hard.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Ep. ad Demophil.): "It seems presumptuous for such a man, one to wit who is not enlightened, to lay hands on <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> things; he is not afraid nor ashamed, all unworthy that he is to take part in Divine things, with the thought that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not see what he sees in himself; he thinks, by <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> pretense, to cheat Him Whom he <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> calls his Father; he dares to utter in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, words polluted by his infamy, I will not call them <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, over the Divine symbols." Therefore a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is a blasphemer and a cheat if he exercises his order unworthily, and thus he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally: and in like manner any other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in orders.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of life is required in one who receives an order, that he may be qualified to exercise it. Now a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally if he present himself for orders in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Much more therefore does he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> mortally whenever he exercises his order.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> prescribes (<a href="../bible/deu016.htm#verse20">Deuteronomy 16:20</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should follow <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> after that which is just." Wherefore whoever fulfills unworthily the duties of his order follows <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> after that which is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, and acts contrary to a precept of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and thereby <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally. Now anyone who exercises a sacred office in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> does so unworthily. Hence it is clear that he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> He is not perplexed as though he were in the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>; for he can renounce his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or resign his office whereby he was bound to the exercise of his order.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> allows of no dispensation; and it is of <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> handle <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holily</a>. Therefore no one can dispense from this.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> So long as a minister of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> who is in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is recognized by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, his subject must receive the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> from him, since this is the purpose for which he is bound to him. Nevertheless, outside the case of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, it would not be safe to induce him to an execution of his Order, as long as he is conscious of being in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, however, he can lay aside since a man is repaired in an instant by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> When any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> performs an action as a minister of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> while in a state of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally, and as often as he performs that action, since, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. i), "it is wrong for the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> even to touch the symbols," i.e. the sacramental signs. Hence when they touch sacred things in the exercise of their office they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> mortally. It would be otherwise if they were to touch some sacred thing or perform some sacred <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> in a case of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, when it would be allowable even to a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, for instance if they were to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> in a case of urgency, or gather up the Lord's body should it be cast to the ground.
