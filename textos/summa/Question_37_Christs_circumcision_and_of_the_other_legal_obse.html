<h1>Question 37. Christ's circumcision, and of the other legal observances accomplished in regard to the child Christ</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/4037.htm#article1"> His circumcision</a> <li><a href="../summa/4037.htm#article2"> The imposition of His name</a> <li><a href="../summa/4037.htm#article3"> His presentation</a> <li><a href="../summa/4037.htm#article4"> His Mother's purification</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether Christ should have been circumcised?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should not have been <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>. For on the advent of the reality, the figure ceases. But <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was prescribed to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> as a sign of the covenant concerning his posterity, as may be seen from <a href="../bible/gen017.htm">Genesis 17</a>. Now this covenant was fulfilled in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth. Therefore <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> should have ceased at once.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "every action of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is a lesson to us" [Innoc. III, Serm. xxii de Temp.; wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse15">John 3:15</a>): "I have given you an example, that as I have done to you, so you do also." But we ought not to be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>; according to <a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse2">Galatians 5:2</a>: "If you be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> shall profit you nothing." Therefore it seems that neither should <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> have been <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was prescribed as a remedy of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not contract <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, as stated above (14, 3; 15, 1). Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should not have been <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse21">Luke 2:21</a>): "After eight days were accomplished, that the child should be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> For several reasons <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> ought to have been circumcised. First, in order to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the reality of His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, in contradiction to the Manicheans, who said that He had an <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> body: and in contradiction to Apollinarius, who said that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was consubstantial with His Godhead; and in contradiction to Valentine, who said that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> brought His body from heaven. Secondly, in order to show His approval of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had instituted of old. Thirdly, in order to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that He was descended from <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, who had received the commandment of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> as a sign of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Him. Fourthly, in order to take away from the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> an excuse for not receiving Him, if He were uncircumcised. Fifthly, "in order by His example to exhort us to be obedient" [<a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>, Hom. x in Evang.]. Wherefore He was <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> on the eighth day according to the prescription of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> (<a href="../bible/lev012.htm#verse3">Leviticus 12:3</a>). Sixthly, "that He who had come in the likeness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> flesh might not reject the remedy whereby <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> flesh was wont to be healed." Seventhly, that by taking on Himself the burden of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, He might set others free therefrom, according to <a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse4">Galatians 4:4-5</a>: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent His Son . . . made under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, that He might redeem them who were under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Circumcision by the removal of the piece of skin in the member of generation, signified "the passing away of the old generation" [<a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, De Sabb. et Circumcis.]: from the decrepitude of which we are freed by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. Consequently this figure was not completely fulfilled in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth, but in His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, until which time the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> retained its <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and status. Therefore it behooved <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> as a son of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> before His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> submitted to <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> while it was yet of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>. And thus His action in this should be imitated by us, in fulfilling those things which are of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> in our own time. Because "there is a time and opportunity for every business" (<a href="../bible/ecc008.htm#verse6">Ecclesiastes 8:6</a>).

<p>Moreover, according to <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> (Hom. xiv in Luc.), "as we died when He died, and rose again when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> rose from the dead, so were we <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> spiritually through Christ: wherefore we need no carnal <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>." And this is what the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse11">Colossians 2:11</a>): "In whom," [i.e. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>] "you are <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> with <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> not made by hand in despoiling of the body of the flesh, but in the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> of" <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus</a> "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> took upon Himself our death, which is the effect of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, whereas He had no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> Himself, in order to deliver us from death, and to make us to die spiritually unto <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so also He took upon Himself <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, which was a remedy against <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, whereas He contracted no <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, in order to deliver us from the yoke of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, and to accomplish a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> in us--in order, that is to say, that, by taking upon Himself the shadow, He might accomplish the reality.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether His name was suitably given to Christ?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that an unsuitable name was given to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For the Gospel reality should correspond to the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> foretelling. But the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> foretold another name for Christ: for it is written (<a href="../bible/isa007.htm#verse14">Isaiah 7:14</a>): "Behold a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> shall conceive and bear a son, and His name shall be called Emmanuel"; and (<a href="../bible/isa008.htm#verse3">Isaiah 8:3</a>): "Call His name, Hasten to take away the spoils; Make haste to take away the prey"; and (<a href="../bible/isa009.htm#verse6">Isaiah 9:6</a>): "His name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Mighty, the Father of the world to come, the Prince of Peace"; and (<a href="../bible/zec006.htm#verse12">Zechariah 6:12</a>): "Behold a Man, the Orient is His name." Thus it was unsuitable that His name should be called <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">Jesus</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/isa062.htm#verse2">Isaiah 62:2</a>): "Thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the Lord hath named [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'shall name']." But the name <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">Jesus</a> is not a new name, but was given to several in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>: as may be seen in the genealogy of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/luk003.htm#verse29">Luke 3:29</a>), "Therefore it seems that it was unfitting for His name to be called <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">Jesus</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the name <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">Jesus</a> signifies "<a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>"; as is clear from <a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse21">Matthew 1:21</a>: "She shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call His name <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">Jesus</a>. For He shall save His people from their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." But <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was accomplished not only in the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, but also in uncircumcision, as is declared by the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse11">Romans 4:11-12</a>). Therefore this name was not suitably given to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> at His <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary</strong> is the authority of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>, in which it is written (<a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse21">Luke 2:21</a>): "After eight days were accomplished, that the child should be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, His name was called <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">Jesus</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A name should answer to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a thing. This is clear in the names of genera and <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as stated Metaph. iv: "Since a name is but an expression of the definition" which designates a thing's proper <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p>Now, the names of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> men are always taken from some property of the men to whom they are given. Either in regard to time; thus men are named after the Saints on whose feasts they are born: or in respect of some blood relation; thus a son is named after his father or some other relation; and thus the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">kinsfolk</a> of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a> wished to call him "by his father's name Zachary," not by the name John, because "there" was "none of" his "kindred that" was "called by this name," as related <a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse59">Luke 1:59-61</a>. Or, again, from some occurrence; thus <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> "called the name of" the "<a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> Manasses, saying: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath made me to forget all my labors" (<a href="../bible/gen041.htm#verse51">Genesis 41:51</a>). Or, again, from some <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who receives the name; thus it is written (<a href="../bible/gen025.htm#verse25">Genesis 25:25</a>) that "he that came forth first was red and hairy like a skin; and his name was called <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>," which is interpreted "red."

<p>But names given to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> always signify some gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> bestowed on them by Him; thus it was said to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> (<a href="../bible/gen017.htm#verse5">Genesis 17:5</a>): "Thou shalt be called <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>; because I have made thee a father of many <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>": and it was said to Peter (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse18">Matthew 16:18</a>): "Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build My Church." Since, therefore, this prerogative of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was bestowed on the Man Christ that through Him all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> might be saved, therefore He was becomingly named <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">Jesus</a>, i.e. Saviour: the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> having foretold this name not only to His Mother, but also to <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>, who was to be his foster-father.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> All these names in some way mean the same as <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">Jesus</a>, which means "<a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>." For the name "Emmanuel, which being interpreted is '<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with us,'" designates the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, which is the union of the Divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> natures in the Person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, the result of which union was that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is with us."

<p>When it was said, "Call his name, Hasten to take away," etc., these words indicate from what He saved us, viz. from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, whose spoils He took away, according to <a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse15">Colossians 2:15</a>: "Despoiling the principalities and powers, He hath exposed them confidently."

<p>When it was said, "His name shall be called Wonderful," etc., the way and term of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> are pointed out: inasmuch as "by the wonderful counsel and might of the Godhead we are brought to the inheritance of the life to come," in which the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will enjoy "perfect peace" under "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> their Prince."

<p>When it was said, "Behold a Man, the Orient is His name," reference is made to the same, as in the first, viz. to the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, by reason of which "to the righteous a light is risen up in darkness" (<a href="../bible/psa111.htm#verse4">Psalm 111:4</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The name <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">Jesus</a> could be suitable for some other reason to those who lived before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>--for instance, because they were saviours in a particular and temporal sense. But in the sense of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and universal <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, this name is proper to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and thus it is called a "new" name.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As is related <a href="../bible/gen017.htm">Genesis 17</a>, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> received from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and at the same time both his name and the commandment of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>. For this reason it was customary among the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> to name children on the very day of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, as though before being <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> they had not as yet perfect <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>: just as now also children receive their names in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Wherefore on <a href="../bible/pro004.htm#verse3">Proverbs 4:3</a>, "I was my father's son, tender, and as an only son in the sight of my mother," the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "Why does Solomon call himself an only son in the sight of his mother, when <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> testifies that he had an elder brother of the same mother, unless it be that the latter died unnamed soon after birth?" Therefore it was that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> received His name at the time of His <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether Christ was becomingly presented in the temple?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was unbecomingly presented in the Temple. For it is written (<a href="../bible/exo013.htm#verse2">Exodus 13:2</a>): "Sanctify unto Me every <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> that openeth the womb among the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> came forth from the closed womb of the Virgin; and thus He did not open His Mother's womb. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not bound by this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to be presented in the Temple.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which is always in one's presence cannot be presented to one. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> humanity was always in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> presence in the highest degree, as being always united to Him in unity of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Therefore there was no need for Him to be presented to the Lord.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the principal victim, to whom all the victims of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">old Law</a> are referred, as the figure to the reality. But a victim should not be offered up for a victim. Therefore it was not fitting that another victim should be offered up for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, among the legal victims the principal was the lamb, which was a "continual sacrifice" [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: '<a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>', as is stated <a href="../bible/num028.htm#verse6">Numbers 28:6</a>: for which reason <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is also called "the Lamb--Behold the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse29">John 1:29</a>). It was therefore more fitting that a lamb should be offered for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> than "a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons."

<p><strong>On the contrary</strong> is the authority of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> which relates this as having taken place (<a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse22">Luke 2:22</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> wished to be "made under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, that He might redeem them who were under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>" (<a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse4">Galatians 4:4-5</a>), and that the "justification of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> might be" spiritually "fulfilled" in His members. Now, the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> contained a twofold precept touching the children born. one was a general precept which affected all--namely, that "when the days of the mother's purification were expired," a sacrifice was to be offered either "for a son or for a daughter," as laid down <a href="../bible/lev012.htm#verse6">Leviticus 12:6</a>. And this sacrifice was for the expiation of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in which the child was conceived and born; and also for a certain <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the child, because it was then presented in the Temple for the first time. Wherefore one offering was made as a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a> and another for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>The other was a special precept in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of "both <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and beast": for the Lord claimed for Himself all the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, because, in order to deliver Israelites, He "slew every <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> in the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, both men and cattle" (<a href="../bible/exo012.htm#verse12">Exodus 12:12-29</a>), the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> being saved; which <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is set down <a href="../bible/exo013.htm">Exodus 13</a>. Here also was <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> foreshadowed, who is "the First-born amongst many brethren" (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse29">Romans 8:29</a>).

<p>Therefore, since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was born of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and was her <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a>, and since He wished to be "made under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>," the Evangelist Luke shows that both these precepts were fulfilled in His regard. First, as to that which concerns the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a>, when he says (<a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse22">Luke 2:22-23</a>): "They carried Him to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord: as it is written in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the Lord, 'Every male opening the womb shall be called <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> to the Lord.'" Secondly, as to the general precept which concerned all, when he says (<a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse24">Luke 2:24</a>): "And to offer a sacrifice according as it is written in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the Lord, a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> says (De Occursu Dom.): "It seems that this precept of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> was fulfilled in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a> alone in a special manner exclusively proper to Him. For He alone, whose conception was ineffable, and whose birth was incomprehensible, opened the virginal womb which had been closed to sexual union, in such a way that after birth the seal of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> remained inviolate." Consequently the words "opening the womb" imply that nothing hitherto had entered or gone forth therefrom. Again, for a special reason is it written "'a male,' because He contracted nothing of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>": and in a singular way "is He called '<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>,' because He felt no contagion of earthly corruption, whose birth was wondrously immaculate" (<a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a>, on <a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse23">Luke 2:23</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> "became <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> in the flesh, not for His own sake, but that He might make us to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and that we might be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> in the spirit; so, again, for our sake He was presented to the Lord, that we may learn to offer ourselves to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" [<a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, on <a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse23">Luke 2:23</a>]. And this was done after His <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, in order to show that "no one who is not <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> from <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is worthy of Divine regard" [<a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>, on <a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse23">Luke 2:23</a>].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> For this very reason He wished the legal victims to be offered for Him who was the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Victim, in order that the figure might be united to and confirmed by the reality, against those who denied that in the Gospel Christ preached the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. "For we must not think," says <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> (Hom. xiv in Luc.) "that the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> subjected His Son to the enemy's <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, which He Himself had not given."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../bible/lev012.htm#verse6">Leviticus 12:6</a>,[8] "commanded those who could, to offer, for a son or a daughter, a lamb and also a turtle dove or a pigeon: but those who were unable to offer a lamb were commanded to offer two turtle doves or two young pigeons" [<a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>, Hom. xv in Purif.]. "And so the Lord, who, 'being rich, became poor for our [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'your'] sakes, that through His <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> we [you] might be rich," as is written <a href="../bible/2co008.htm#verse9">2 Corinthians 8:9</a>, "wished the poor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> victim to be offered for Him" just as in His birth He was "wrapped in swaddling clothes and laid in a manger" [<a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> on <a href="../bible/luk001.htm">Luke 1</a>]. Nevertheless, these birds have a figurative sense. For the turtle dove, being a loquacious bird, represents the preaching and confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and because it is a chaste animal, it signifies <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>; and being a solitary animal, it signifies <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>. The pigeon is a gentle and simple animal, and therefore signifies gentleness and simplicity. It is also a gregarious animal; wherefore it signifies the active life. Consequently this sacrifice signified the perfection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and His members. Again, "both these animals, by the plaintiveness of their song, represented the mourning of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in this life: but the turtle dove, being solitary, signifies the tears of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; whereas the pigeon, being gregarious, signifies the public <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>" [<a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>, Hom. xv in Purif.]. Lastly, two of each of these animals are offered, to show that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> should be not only in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but also in the body.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether it was fitting that the Mother of God should go to the temple to be purified?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it was unfitting for the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> to go to the Temple to be purified. For purification presupposes <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>. But there was no <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, as stated above (Q27,28). Therefore she should not have gone to the Temple to be purified.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/lev012.htm#verse2">Leviticus 12:2-4</a>): "If a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, having received seed, shall bear a man-child, she shall be <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> seven days"; and consequently she is forbidden "to enter into the sanctuary until the days of her purification be fulfilled." But the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> brought forth a male child without receiving the seed of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore she had no need to come to the Temple to be purified.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, purification from <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> is accomplished by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> alone. But the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> did not confer <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; rather, indeed, did she have the very Author of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> with her. Therefore it was not fitting that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> should come to the Temple to be purified.

<p><strong>On the contrary</strong> is the authority of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>, where it is stated (<a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse22">Luke 2:22</a>) that "the days of" Mary's "purification were accomplished according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As the fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> flowed from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> on to His Mother, so it was becoming that the mother should be like her Son in <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>: for "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> giveth <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>," as is written <a href="../bible/jam004.htm#verse6">James 4:6</a>. And therefore, just as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, though not subject to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, wished, nevertheless, to submit to <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> and the other burdens of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, in order to give an example of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> and obedience; and in order to show His approval of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>; and, again, in order to take away from the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> an excuse for calumniating Him: for the same reasons He wished His Mother also to fulfil the prescriptions of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, to which, nevertheless, she was not subject.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> had no <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>, yet she wished to fulfil the observance of purification, not because she needed it, but on account of the precept of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. Thus the Evangelist says pointedly that the days of her purification "according to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>" were accomplished; for she needed no purification in herself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> seems to have chosen his words in order to exclude <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> from the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, who was with child "without receiving seed." It is therefore clear that she was not bound to fulfil that precept, but fulfilled the observance of purification of her own accord, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> did not cleanse from the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is accomplished by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but they foreshadowed this purification: for they cleansed by a kind of carnal purification, from the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> of a certain <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a>, as stated in I-II, 102, 5; I-II, 103, 2. But the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> contracted neither <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>, and consequently did not need to be purified.
