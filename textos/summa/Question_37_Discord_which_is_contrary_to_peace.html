<ol><li><a href="../summa/3037.htm#article1"> Is discord a sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3037.htm#article2"> Is it a daughter of vainglory?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether discord is a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that discord is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For to disaccord with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is to sever oneself from another's will. But this does not seem to be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will alone, and not our neighbor's, is the rule of our own will. Therefore discord is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whoever induces another to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> also himself. But it appears not to be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to incite others to discord, for it is written (<a href="../bible/act023.htm#verse6">Acts 23:6</a>) that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that the one part were Sadducees, and the other <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, cried out in the council: "Men brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, concerning the hope and <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the dead</a> I am called in question. And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees." Therefore discord is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, especially mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is not to be found in a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But discord is to be found even among <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, for it is written (<a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse39">Acts 15:39</a>): "There arose a dissension" between <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and Barnabas, "so that they departed one from another." Therefore discord is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. and least of all a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> "Dissensions," that is, discords, are reckoned among the works of the flesh (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse20">Galatians 5:20</a>), of which it is said afterwards (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse21">Galatians 5:21</a>) that "they who do such things shall not obtain the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>." Now nothing, save mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, excludes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>. Therefore discord is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Discord is opposed to concord. Now, as stated above (29, 1,3) concord results from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, in as much as <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> directs many hearts together to one thing, which is chiefly the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, secondarily, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of our neighbor. Wherefore discord is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in so far as it is opposed to this concord.

<p>But it must be observed that this concord is destroyed by discord in two ways: first, directly; secondly, <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>. Now, <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> and movements are said to be direct when they are according to one's <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>. Wherefore a man directly disaccords with his neighbor, when he knowingly and intentionally dissents from the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and his neighbor's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, to which he ought to consent. This is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in respect of its genus, because it is contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, although the first movements of such discord are venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by reason of their being imperfect acts.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> is that which occurs beside the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>. Hence when several intend a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> pertaining to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, or our neighbor's profit, while one deems a certain thing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and another thinks contrariwise, the discord is in this case <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> contrary to the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or that of our neighbor. Such like discord is neither <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> nor against <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, unless it be accompanied by an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> about things <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, or by undue obstinacy, since it has also been stated above (29, 1,3, ad 2) that the concord which is an effect of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, is union of wills not of opinions. It follows from this that discord is sometimes the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of one party only, for instance, when one wills a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which the other knowingly resists; while sometimes it implies <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in both parties, as when each dissents from the other's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and loves his own.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> One <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will considered in itself is not the rule of another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will; but in so far as our neighbor's will adheres to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will, it becomes in consequence, a rule regulated according to its proper measure. Wherefore it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to disaccord with such a will, because by that very fact one disaccords with the Divine rule.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as a man's will that adheres to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a right rule, to disaccord with which is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so too a man's will that is opposed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a perverse rule, to disaccord with which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Hence to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a discord, whereby a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> concord resulting from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is destroyed, is a grave <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/pro006.htm#verse16">Proverbs 6:16</a>): "Six things there are, which the Lord hateth, and the seventh His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> detesteth," which seventh is stated (<a href="../bible/pro006.htm#verse19">Proverbs 6:19</a>) to be "him that soweth discord among brethren." On the other hand, to arouse a discord whereby an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> concord (i.e. concord in an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will) is destroyed, is praiseworthy. On this way <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was to be commended for sowing discord among those who concorded together in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> also said of Himself (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse34">Matthew 10:34</a>): "I came not to send peace, but the sword."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The discord between <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and Barnabas was <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> and not direct: because each intended some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, yet the one thought one thing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, while the other thought something else, which was owing to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> deficiency: for that controversy was not about things <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Moreover all this was ordained by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a>, on account of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which would ensue.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether discord is a daughter of vainglory?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that discord is not a daughter of vainglory. For <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> distinct from vainglory. Now discord is apparently the daughter of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, according to <a href="../bible/pro015.htm#verse18">Proverbs 15:18</a>: "A passionate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> stirreth up strifes." Therefore it is not a daughter of vainglory.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> expounding the words of <a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse39">John 7:39</a>, "As yet the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> was not given," says (Tract. xxxii) "Malice severs, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> unites." Now discord is merely a separation of wills. Therefore discord arises from <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, i.e. <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, rather than from vainglory.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whatever gives rise to many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, would seem to be a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. Now such is discord, because <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> in <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse25">Matthew 12:25</a>, "Every kingdom divided against itself shall be made desolate," says: "Just as concord makes small things thrive, so discord brings the greatest things to ruin." Therefore discord should itself be reckoned a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, rather than a daughter of vainglory.

<p><strong>On the contrary</strong> stands the authority of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi, 45).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Discord denotes a certain disunion of wills, in so far, to wit, as one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will holds fast to one thing, while the other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will holds fast to something else. Now if a man's will holds fast to its own ground, this is due to the act that he prefers what is his own to that which belongs to others, and if he do this inordinately, it is due to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and vainglory. Therefore discord, whereby a man holds to his own way of thinking, and departs from that of others, is reckoned to be a daughter of vainglory.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Strife is not the same as discord, for strife consists in external <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, wherefore it is becoming that it should arise from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, which incites the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to hurt one's neighbor; whereas discord consists in a divergence in the movements of wills, which arises from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> or vainglory, for the reason given above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In discord we may consider that which is the term "wherefrom," i.e. another's will from which we recede, and in this respect it arises from <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>; and again we may consider that which is the term "whither," i.e. something of our own to which we cling, and in this respect it is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by vainglory. And since in every moment the term "whither" is more important than the term "wherefrom" (because the end is of more account than the beginning), discord is accounted a daughter of vainglory rather than of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, though it may arise from both for different reasons, as stated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The reason why concord makes small things thrive, while discord brings the greatest to ruin, is because "the more united a force is, the stronger it is, while the more disunited it is the weaker it becomes" (De Causis xvii). Hence it is evident that this is part of the proper effect of discord which is a disunion of wills, and in no way indicates that other <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> arise from discord, as though it were a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.
