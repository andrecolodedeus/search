<h1>Question 37. The distinction of Orders, of their acts, and the imprinting of the character</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5037.htm#article1"> Should Order be divided into several kinds?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5037.htm#article2"> How many are there?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5037.htm#article3"> Should they be divided into those that are sacred and those that are not?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5037.htm#article4"> Are the acts of the Orders rightly assigned in the text?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5037.htm#article5"> When are the characters of the Orders imprinted?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether we ought to distinguish several Orders?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that we ought not to distinguish several Orders. For the greater a power is, the less is it multiplied. Now this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> ranks above the others in so far as it places its recipients in a degree above other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Since then the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are not divided into several of which the whole is predicated, neither ought this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> to be divided into several Orders.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if it be divided, the parts of the division are either integral or subjective. But they are not integral, for then the whole would not be predicated of them. Therefore it is a division into subjective parts. Now subjective parts can have the remote genus predicated of them in the plural in the same way as the proximate genus; thus <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and ass are several animals, and are several animated bodies. Therefore also <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a>, as they are several Orders, even so are several <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, since sacrament is the genus, so to speak, in respect of Orders.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. viii, 10) the form of authority in which one alone governs is a better government of the common weal than aristocracy, where different <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> occupy different offices. But the government of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should be the best of all. Therefore in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> there should be no distinction of Orders for different acts, but the whole power should reside in one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; and consequently there ought to be only one Order.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The Church is <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">Christ's mystical body</a>, like to our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> body, according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse24">Romans 12:5</a>; <a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse24">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>; <a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse24">Ephesians 1:22-23</a>; <a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse24">Colossians 1:24</a>). Now in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> body there are various offices of the members. Therefore in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> also there should be various Orders.

<p>Further, the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> is superior to that of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> (<a href="../bible/2co003.htm">2 Corinthians 3</a>). Now in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> not only the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, but also their ministers, the Levites, were <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>. Therefore likewise in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> not only the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> but also their ministers should be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacrament of Order</a>; and consequently there ought to be several Orders.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Multiplicity of Orders was introduced into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for three reasons. First to show forth the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is reflected in the orderly distinction of things both <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>. This is signified in the statement of <a href="../bible/1ki010.htm#verse4">1 Kings 10:4 [5]</a>, that "when the queen of Saba saw . . . the order of" <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon's</a> "servants . . . she had no longer any spirit in her," for she was breathless from admiration of his wisdom. Secondly, in order to succor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness, because it would be impossible for one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, without his being heavily burdened, to fulfill all things pertaining to the Divine mysteries; and so various orders are severally appointed to the various offices; and this is shown by the Lord giving <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> seventy ancients to assist him. Thirdly, that men may be given a broader way for advancing (to perfection), seeing that the various duties are divided among many men, so that all become the co-operators of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; than which nothing is more <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>-like, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. iii).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are given that certain effects may be received; but this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is given chiefly that certain acts may be performed. Hence it behooves the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacrament of Order</a> to be differentiated according to the diversity of acts, even as powers are differentiated by their acts.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The division of Order is not that of an integral whole into its parts, nor of a universal whole, but of a <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a> whole, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of which is that the notion of the whole is found to be complete in one part, but in the others by some participation thereof. Thus it is here: for the entire fulness of the sacrament is in one Order, namely the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, while in the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> there is a participation of Order. And this is signified by the Lord saying (<a href="../bible/num011.htm#verse17">Numbers 11:17</a>): "I will take of thy spirit and give to them, that they may bear with thee the burden of the people." Therefore all the Orders are one sacrament.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In a kingdom, although the entire fulness of power resides in the king, this does not exclude the ministers having a power which is a participation of the kingly power. It is the same in Order. In the aristocratic form of government, on the contrary, the fulness of power resides in no one, but in all.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether there are seven Orders?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there are not seven Orders. For the Orders of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are directed to the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchical</a> acts. But there are only three <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchical</a> acts, namely "to cleanse, to enlighten, and to perfect," for which reason <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> distinguishes three Orders (Eccl. Hier. v). Therefore there are not seven.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> derive their efficacy and authenticity from their institution by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or at least by His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. But no mention except of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> is made in the teaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. Therefore seemingly there are no other Orders.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, by the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacrament of Order</a> a man is appointed to dispense the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. But there are only six other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Therefore there should be only six Orders.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> On the other hand, It would seem that there ought to be more. For the higher a power is, the less is it subject to multiplication. Now the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchical</a> power is in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in a higher way than in us, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. i). Since then there are nine Orders in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, there should be as many, or more, in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of the Psalms is the most noble of all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophecies</a>. Now there is one Order, namely of readers, for reading the other <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophecies</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Therefore there ought to be another Order for reading the Psalms, especially since (<a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a>, Dist. xxi, cap. Cleros) the "psalmist" is reckoned as the second Order after the <a href="../cathen/12284b.htm">doorkeeper</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some show the sufficiency of the orders from their correspondence with the gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> which are indicated <a href="../bible/1co012.htm">1 Corinthians 12</a>. For they say that the "word of wisdom" belongs to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, because he is the ordainer of others, which pertains to wisdom; the "word of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>" to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, for he ought to have the key of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>" to the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, for he preaches the Gospel; the "working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>" to the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, who sets himself to do <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of perfection by the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a>; <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">"interpretation of speeches"</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolyte</a>, this being signified by the light which he bears; the "<a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of healing" to the <a href="../cathen/05711a.htm">exorcist</a>; "diverse kinds of tongues" to the psalmist; "<a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>" to the reader; and the "discerning of spirits" to the <a href="../cathen/12284b.htm">doorkeeper</a>, for he excludes some and admits others. But this is of no account, for the gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> are not given, as the Orders are, to one same <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse4">1 Corinthians 12:4</a>): "There are distributions [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'diversities'] of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>." Moreover the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopate</a> [Cf. 40, 5] and the office of psalmist are included, which are not Orders. Wherefore others account for the Orders by likening them to the heavenly <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, where the Orders are distinguished in reference to cleansing, enlightening, and perfecting. Thus they say that the doorkeeper cleanses outwardly, by separating even in the body the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>; that the <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolyte</a> cleanses inwardly, because by the light which he bears, he signifies that he dispels inward darkness; and that the <a href="../cathen/05711a.htm">exorcist</a> cleanses both ways, for he casts out the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> who disturbs a man both ways. But enlightening, which is effected by teaching, is done by readers as regards <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> doctrine; by <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a> as to apostolic doctrine; and by <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> as to the gospel doctrine; while ordinary perfection, such as the perfection of Penance, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, and so forth is the work of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>; excellent perfection, such as the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, is the work of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; while the most excellent perfection is the work of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Sovereign Pontiff</a> in whom resides the fulness of authority. But this again is of no account; both because the orders of the heavenly <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> are not distinguished by the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchical</a> actions, since each of them is applicable to every Order; and because, according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Eccl. Hier. v), perfecting belongs to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> alone, enlightening to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and cleansing to all the ministers. Wherefore others suit the orders to the seven <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, so that the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> corresponds to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of wisdom, which feeds us with the bread of life and understanding, even as the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> refreshes us with the heavenly bread; fear to the <a href="../cathen/12284b.htm">doorkeeper</a>, for he separates us from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>; and thus the intermediate Orders to the intermediate <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>. But this again is of no account, since the sevenfold <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is given in each one of the Orders. Consequently we must answer differently by saying that the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacrament of Order</a> is directed to the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, which is the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. iii). For just as temple, altar, vessels, and <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a> need to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, so do the ministers who are ordained for the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>; and this <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> is the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacrament of Order</a>. Hence the distinction of Orders is derived from their relation to the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>. For the power of Order is directed either to the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> itself, or to some ministry in connection with this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>. If in the former way, then it is the Order of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>; hence when they are ordained, they receive the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> with wine, and the paten with the bread, because they are receiving the power to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the body and blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The co-operation of the ministers is directed either to the sacrament itself, or to the recipients. If the former, this happens in three ways. For in the first place, there is the ministry whereby the minister co-operates with the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in the sacrament itself, by dispensing, but not by <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a>, for this is done by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> alone; and this belongs to the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>. Hence in the text (Sent. iv, D, 24) it is said that it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> to minister to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in whatever is done in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, wherefore he dispenses <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> blood. Secondly, there is the ministry directed to the disposal of the sacramental <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in the sacred vessels of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. and this belongs to <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a>. Wherefore it is stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 24) that they carry the vessels of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> body and blood, and place the oblation on the altar; hence, when they are ordained, they receive the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, empty however, from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> hands. Thirdly, there is the ministry directed to the proffering of the sacramental <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and this belongs to the <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolyte</a>. For he, as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 24), prepares the <a href="../cathen/04543a.htm">cruet</a> with wine and water; wherefore he receives an empty <a href="../cathen/04543a.htm">cruet</a>. The ministry directed to the preparation of the recipients can be exercised only over the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>, since those who are clean are already apt for receiving the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> are of three kinds, according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Eccl. Hier. iii). For some are absolute unbelievers and unwilling to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; and these must be altogether debarred from beholding Divine things and from the assembly of the faithful; this belongs to the doorkeepers. Some, however, are willing to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, but are not as yet instructed, namely catechumens, and to the instruction of such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> the Order of readers is directed, who are therefore entrusted with the reading of the first rudiments of the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, namely the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. But some are believers and instructed, yet lie under an impediment through the power of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, namely those who are possessed: and to this ministry the order of exorcists is directed. Thus the reason and number of the degrees of Orders is made clear.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> is speaking of the orders not as <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, but as directed to <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchical</a> actions. Wherefore he distinguishes three Orders corresponding to those actions. The first of these Orders, namely the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, has all three actions; the second, namely the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, has two; while the third has one, namely to cleanse; this is the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> who is called a minister: and under this last all the lower Orders are comprised. But the Orders derive their sacramental <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> from their relation to the greatest of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and consequently the number of Orders depends on this.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In the early <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, on account of the fewness of ministers, all the lower ministries were entrusted to the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. iii), where he says: "Some of the ministers stand at the closed door of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, others are otherwise occupied in the exercise of their own order; others place the sacred bread and the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> of benediction on the altar and offer them to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>." Nevertheless all the power to do all these things was included in the one power of the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, though implicitly. But afterwards the Divine worship developed, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> committed expressly to several <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> that which had hitherto been committed implicitly in one Order. This is what the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> means, when He says in the text (Sent. iv, D, 24) that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> instituted other Orders.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The orders are directed to the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> chiefly, and to the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> consequently, for even the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> flow from that which is contained in that sacrament. Hence it does not follow that the orders ought to be distinguished according to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> differ specifically [Cf. I, 50, 4]: for this reason it is possible for them to have various modes of receiving Divine things, and hence also they are divided into various hierarchies. But in men there is only one <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, because they have only one mode of receiving Divine things, which results from the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, namely through the images of sensible objects. Consequently the distinction of orders in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> cannot bear any relation to a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> as it is with us, but only a relation to the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchical</a> actions which among them each Order exercises on the Orders below. In this respect our Orders correspond to theirs; since in our <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> there are three Orders, distinguished according to the three <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchical</a> actions, even as in each <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The office of psalmist is not an Order, but an office annexed to an Order. For the psalmist is also styled precentor because the psalms are recited with chant. Now precentor is not the name of a special Order, both because it belongs to the whole choir to sing, and because he has no special relation to the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>. Since, however, it is a particular office, it is sometimes reckoned among the Orders, taking these in a broad sense.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the Order should be divided into those that are sacred and those that are not?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the Orders ought not to be divided into those that are sacred and those that are not. For all the Orders are <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are sacred. Therefore all the Orders are sacred.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, by the Orders of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> a man is not appointed to any other than Divine offices. Now all these are sacred. Therefore all the Orders also are sacred.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The sacred Orders are an impediment to the contracting of marriage and annul the marriage that is already contracted. But the four lower orders neither impede the contracting nor annul the contract. Therefore these are not sacred Orders.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> An Order is said to be sacred in two ways. First, in itself, and thus every order is sacred, since it is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Secondly, by reason of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> about which it exercises an act, and thus an Order is called sacred, if it exercises an act about some <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> thing. In this sense there are only three sacred Orders, namely the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a>, which exercise an act about the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> body and blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdiaconate</a>, which exercises an act about the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> vessels. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a> is enjoined them, that they who handle <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things may themselves be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and clean.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the acts of the Orders are rightly assigned in the text?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the acts of the Orders are not rightly assigned in the text (Sent. iv, D, 24). Because a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is prepared by <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> to receive <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body. Now the preparation of the recipients of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> belongs to the lower Orders. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is unfittingly reckoned among the acts of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is made like to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> immediately in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, by receiving the character which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> this likeness. But <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and the offering of oblations are acts directed immediately to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore every <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> can perform these acts, and not <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> alone.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, different Orders have different acts. But it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> to place the oblations on the altar, and to read the epistle; and <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a> carry the cross before the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>. Therefore these acts should not be assigned to the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the same <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is contained in the Old and in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. But it belongs to the readers to read the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. Therefore it should belong to them likewise, and not to <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, to read the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> preached naught else but the gospel of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse15">Romans 1:15</a>). But the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> is entrusted to <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a> to be read by them. Therefore the Gospel teaching should be also.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Eccl. Hier. v) that which belongs to a higher Order should not be applicable to a lower Order. But it is an act of <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a> to minister with the <a href="../cathen/04543a.htm">cruets</a>. Therefore it should not be assigned to <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 7.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> actions should rank above bodily actions. But the <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolyte's</a> act is merely corporeal. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/05711a.htm">exorcist</a> has not the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> act of casting out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">devils</a>, since he is of inferior rank.

<p><strong>Objection 8.</strong> Further, things that have most in common should be placed beside one another. Now the reading of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> must needs have most in common with the reading of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, which latter belongs to the higher ministers. Therefore the reading of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> should be reckoned the act, not of the reader, but rather of the <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolyte</a>; especially since the bodily light which the acolytes carry signifies the light of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> doctrine.

<p><strong>Objection 9.</strong> Further, in every act of a special Order, there should be some special power, which the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> ordained has to the exclusion of other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. But in opening and shutting doors the doorkeeper has no special power that other men have not. Therefore this should not be reckoned their act.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> conferred in the sacrament of orders is directed to the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), the principal act of each order is that whereby it is most nearly directed to the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>. In this respect, too, one order ranks above another, in so far as one act is more nearly directed to that same sacrament. But because many things are directed to the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, as being the most exalted of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, it follows not unfittingly that one Order has many acts besides its principal act, and all the more, as it ranks higher, since a power extends to the more things, the higher it is.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The preparation of the recipients of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is twofold. One is remote and is effected by the ministers: another is proximate, whereby they are rendered apt at once for receiving the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. This latter belongs to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, since even in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> receives from one and the same agent both the ultimate disposition to the form, and the form itself. And since a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> acquires the proximate disposition to the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> by being cleansed from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it follows that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is the proper minister of all those <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which are chiefly instituted for the cleansing of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, namely <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, Penance, and <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Acts are directed immediately to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in two ways; in one way on the part of one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> only, for instance the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, and so forth: such acts befit any <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. In another way on the part of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and thus the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> alone exercises acts immediately directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; because to impersonate the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> belongs to him alone who consecrates the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, which is the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">universal</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The offerings made by the people are offered through the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Hence a twofold ministry is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> with regard to offerings. One on the part of the people: and this belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> who receives the offerings from the people and places them on the altar or offers them to the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>. the other is on the part of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and belongs to the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, who hands the offerings to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. This is the principal act of both Orders, and for this reason the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon's</a> Order is the higher. But to read the epistle does not belong to a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, except as the acts of lower Orders are ascribed to the higher; and in like manner to carry the cross. Moreover, this depends on the customs of Churches, because in secondary acts it is not unfitting for customs to vary.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Doctrine is a remote preparation for the reception of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; wherefore the announcement of doctrine is entrusted to the ministers. But the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> is more remote than that of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, since it contains no instruction about this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> except in figures. Hence announcing of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> is entrusted to the higher ministers, and that of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> to the lower ministers. Moreover the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> is more perfect as delivered by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> Himself, than as made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. Wherefore the Gospel is committed to <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> and the Epistle to <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a>.

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the Fifth Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">Acolytes</a> exercise an act over the <a href="../cathen/04543a.htm">cruet</a> alone, and not over the contents of the <a href="../cathen/04543a.htm">cruet</a>; whereas the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> exercises an act over the contents of the <a href="../cathen/04543a.htm">cruet</a>, because he handles the water and wine to the end that they be put into the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>,* and again he pours the water over the hands of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, like the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, exercises an act over the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> only, not over its contents, whereas the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> exercises an act over the contents. [The wording of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> is sufficiently vague to refer either to the Roman rite, where the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> pours the wine and water into the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, or to the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> rite, where this is done by the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>.] Wherefore as the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> at his ordination receives an empty <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> receives a full <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, so the <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolyte</a> receives an empty <a href="../cathen/04543a.htm">cruet</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> a full one. Thus there is a certain connection among the Orders.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 7.</strong> The bodily acts of the <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolyte</a> are more intimately connected with the act of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a> than the act of the <a href="../cathen/05711a.htm">exorcist</a>, although the latter is, in a fashion, <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>. For the acolytes exercise a ministry over the vessels in which the sacramental <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is contained, as regards the wine, which needs a vessel to hold it on account of its humidity. Hence of all the <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>the Order of acolytes is the highest.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 8.</strong> The act of the <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolyte</a> is more closely connected with the principal acts of the higher ministers, than the acts of the other <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor Orders</a>, as is self-evident; and again as regards the secondary acts whereby they prepare the people by doctrine. For the <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolyte</a> by bearing a light represents the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> in a visible manner, while the reader by his recital represents it differently, wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolyte</a> is of higher rank. It is the same with the <a href="../cathen/05711a.htm">exorcist</a>, for as the act of the reader is compared with the secondary act of the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, so is the act of the <a href="../cathen/05711a.htm">exorcist</a> compared with the secondary act of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, namely to bind and to loose, by which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is wholly freed from the slavery of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. This, too, shows the degrees of Order to be most orderly. since only the three higher Orders co-operate with the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in his principal act which is to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, while both the higher and lower Orders co-operate with him in his secondary act, which is to loose and bind.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 9.</strong> Some say that in receiving the Order the doorkeeper is given a Divine power to debar others from entering the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, even as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had, when He cast out the sellers from the Temple. But this belongs to a gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> rather than to a sacramental <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Wherefore we should reply that he receives the power to do this by virtue of his office, although others may do so, but not officially. It is the case in all the acts of the <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor Orders</a>, that they can be lawfully exercised by others, even though these have no office to that effect: just as Mass may be said in an unconsecrated building, although the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of a church is directed to the purpose that Mass be said there.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the character is imprinted on a priest when the chalice is handed to him?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the character is not imprinted on the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at the moment when the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> is handed to him. For the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is done by anointing as in Confirmation. Now in Confirmation the character is imprinted at the moment of anointing; and therefore in the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> also and not at the handing of the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> gave His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> power when He said (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse22">John 20:22-23</a>): "Receive ye the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> you shall forgive," etc. Now the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is given by the imposition of hands. Therefore the character of order is given at the moment of the imposition of hands.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as the ministers are <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, even so are the ministers' <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> alone consecrates the <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> also is effected by the mere <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, as a <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> is handed to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, even so is the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestment</a>. Therefore if a character is imprinted at the giving of the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, so likewise is there at the giving of the chasuble, and thus a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> would have two characters: but this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon's</a> order is more closely allied to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> Order than is the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon's</a>. But if a character is imprinted on the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at the moment of the handing of the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> would be more closely allied to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> than the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>; because the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> receives the character at the handing of the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> and not the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> character is not imprinted at the handing of the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, the Order of acolytes approaches nearer to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> act by exercising an act over the <a href="../cathen/04543a.htm">cruet</a> than by exercising an act over the torch. Yet the character is imprinted on the acolytes when they receive the torch rather than when they receive the <a href="../cathen/04543a.htm">cruet</a>, because the name of <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolyte</a> signifies candle-bearer. Therefore the character is not imprinted on the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> when he receives the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The principal act of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> Order is to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> Christ's body. Now he receives the power to this effect at the handing of the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>. Therefore the character is imprinted on him then.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (4, ad 1), to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the form and to give the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> its proximate preparation for the form belong to the same agent. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in conferring orders does two things; for he prepares the candidates for the reception of orders, and delivers to them the power of order. He prepares them, both by instructing them in their respective offices and by doing something to them, so that they may be adapted to receive the power. This preparation consists of three things, namely <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>, imposition of hands, and anointing. By the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> they are enlisted in the Divine service, wherefore the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> is given to all. By the imposition of hands the fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is given, whereby they are qualified for exalted duties, wherefore only <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> receive the imposition of hands, because they are competent to dispense the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, although the latter as principal dispensers, the former as ministers. But by the anointing they are <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> for the purpose of handling the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, wherefore the anointing is done to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> alone who touch the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> with their own hands; even as a <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> is anointed because it holds the blood, and the paten because it holds the body.

<p>The conferring of power is effected by giving them something pertaining to their proper act. And since the principal act of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the body and blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> character is imprinted at the very giving of the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> under the prescribed form of words.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In Confirmation there is not given the office of exercising an act on an exterior <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, wherefore the character is not imprinted in that sacrament at the handing of some particular thing, but at the mere imposition of hands and anointing. But it is otherwise in the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> Order, and consequently the comparison fails.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> gave His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> power, as regards the principal act, before His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">passion</a> at the supper when He said: "Take ye and eat" (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse26">Matthew 26:26</a>), wherefore He added: "Do this for a commemoration of Me" (<a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse19">Luke 22:19</a>). After the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, however, He gave them the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> power, as to its secondary act, which is to bind and loose.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Vestments require no other <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> except to be set aside for the Divine worship, wherefore the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> suffices for their <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. But it is different with those who are ordained, as explained above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestment</a> signifies, not the power given to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, but the aptitude required of him for exercising the act of that power. Wherefore a character is imprinted neither on the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> nor on anyone else at the giving of a <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestment</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon's</a> power is midway between the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon's</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> exercises a power directly on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> on the vessels only, and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body contained in a vessel. Hence it is not for him to touch <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, but to carry the body on the paten, and to dispense the blood with the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>. Consequently his power, as to the principal act, could not be expressed, either by the giving of the vessel only, or by the giving of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; and his power is expressed as to the secondary act alone, by his receiving the book of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, and this power is understood to contain the other; wherefore the character is impressed at the handing of the book.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> The act of the <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolyte</a> whereby he serves with the <a href="../cathen/04543a.htm">cruet</a> ranks before his act of carrying the torch; although he takes his name from the secondary act, because it is better <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and more proper to him. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolyte</a> receives the character when he is given the <a href="../cathen/04543a.htm">cruet</a>, by virtue of the words uttered by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.
