<h1>Question 37. The name of the Holy Ghost--Love</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1037.htm#article1"> Is it the proper name of the Holy Ghost?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1037.htm#article2"> Do the Father and the Son love each other by the Holy Ghost?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether "Love" is the proper name of the Holy Ghost?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that "Love" is not the proper name of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xv, 17): "As the Father, Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are called Wisdom, and are not three Wisdoms, but one; I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not why the Father, Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> should not be called <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a>, and all together one <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a>." But no name which is predicated in the singular of each <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and of all together, is a proper name of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Therefore this name, "Love," is not the proper name of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is a subsisting <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, but love is not used to signify a subsisting <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, but rather an action passing from the lover to the beloved. Therefore Love is not the proper name of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, Love is the bond between lovers, for as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv): "Love is a unitive force." But a bond is a medium between what it joins together, not something proceeding from them. Therefore, since the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> proceeds from the Father and the Son, as was shown above (Question 36, Article 2), it seems that He is not the Love or bond of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, Love belongs to every lover. But the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is a lover: therefore He has love. So if the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is Love, He must be love of love, and spirit from spirit; which is not admissible.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xxx, in Pentecost.): "The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> Himself is Love."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The name Love in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can be taken <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> and personally. If taken personally it is the proper name of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; as Word is the proper name of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.

<p>To see this we must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that since as shown above (27, 2,3,4,5), there are two processions in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, one by way of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which is the procession of the Word, and another by way of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which is the procession of Love; forasmuch as the former is the more <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us, we have been able to apply more suitable names to express our various considerations as regards that procession, but not as regards the procession of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Hence, we are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to employ circumlocution as regards the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> Who proceeds, and the relations following from this procession which are called "procession" and "spiration," as stated above (27, 4, ad 3), and yet express the origin rather than the relation in the strict sense of the term. Nevertheless we must consider them in respect of each procession simply. For as when a thing is understood by anyone, there results in the one who understands a conception of the object understood, which conception we call word; so when anyone loves an object, a certain impression results, so to speak, of the thing loved in the affection of the lover; by reason of which the object loved is said to be in the lover; as also the thing understood is in the one who understands; so that when anyone understands and loves himself he is in himself, not only by real identity, but also as the object understood is in the one who understands, and the thing loved is in the lover. As regards the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, however, words have been found to describe the mutual relation of the one who understands the object understood, as appears in the word "to understand"; and other words are used to express the procession of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> conception--namely, "to speak," and "word." Hence in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, "to understand" is applied only to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; because it does not import relation to the Word that proceeds; whereas "Word" is said personally, because it signifies what proceeds; and the term "to speak" is a notional term as importing the relation of the principle of the Word to the Word Himself. On the other hand, on the part of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, with the exception of the words "dilection" and "love," which express the relation of the lover to the object loved, there are no other terms in use, which express the relation of the impression or affection of the object loved, produced in the lover by fact that he loves--to the principle of that impression, or "vice versa." And therefore, on account of the <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> of our vocabulary, we express these relations by the words "love" and "dilection": just as if we were to call the Word "<a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> conceived," or "wisdom begotten."

<p>It follows that so far as love means only the relation of the lover to the object loved, "love" and "to love" are said of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, as "understanding" and "to understand"; but, on the other hand, so far as these words are used to express the relation to its principle, of what proceeds by way of love, and "vice versa," so that by "love" is understood the "love proceeding," and by "to love" is understood "the spiration of the love proceeding," in that sense "love" is the name of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and "to love" is a notional term, as "to speak" and "to beget."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is there speaking of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> as it means the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, as was said above (here and 24, 2, ad 4).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although to understand, and to will, and to love signify actions passing on to their objects, nevertheless they are actions that remain in the agents, as stated above (Question 14, Article 4), yet in such a way that in the agent itself they import a certain relation to their object. Hence, love also in ourselves is something that abides in the lover, and the word of the heart is something abiding in the speaker; yet with a relation to the thing expressed by word, or loved. But in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in whom there is nothing <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>, there is more than this; because both Word and Love are subsistent. Therefore, when we say that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is the Love of the Father for the Son, or for something else; we do not mean anything that passes into another, but only the relation of love to the beloved; as also in the Word is imported the relation of the Word to the thing expressed by the Word.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is said to be the bond of the Father and Son, inasmuch as He is Love; because, since the Father loves Himself and the Son with one Love, and conversely, there is expressed in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as Love, the relation of the Father to the Son, and conversely, as that of the lover to the beloved. But from the fact that the Father and the Son mutually love one another, it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> follows that this mutual Love, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, proceeds from both. As regards origin, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is not the medium, but the third <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>; whereas as regards the aforesaid relation He is the bond between the two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, as proceeding from both.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As it does not belong to the Son, though He understands, to produce a word, for it belongs to Him to understand as the word proceeding; so in like manner, although the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> loves, taking Love as an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> term, still it does not belong to Him to spirate love, which is to take love as a notional term; because He loves <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> as love proceeding; but not as the one whence love proceeds.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the Father and the Son love each other by the Holy Ghost?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the Father and the Son do not love each other by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. vii, 1) proves that the Father is not wise by the Wisdom begotten. But as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is Wisdom begotten, so the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is the Love proceeding, as explained above (Question 27, Article 3). Therefore the Father and the Son do not love Themselves by the Love proceeding, which is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the proposition, "The Father and the Son love each other by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>," this word "love" is to be taken either <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> or notionally. But it cannot be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> if taken <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, because in the same way we might say that "the Father understands by the Son"; nor, again, if it is taken notionally, for then, in like manner, it might be said that "the Father and the Son spirate by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>," or that "the Father generates by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>." Therefore in no way is this proposition <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: "'The Father and the Son love each other by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, by the same love the Father loves the Son, and Himself, and us. But the Father does not love Himself by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; for no notional act is reflected back on the principle of the act; since it cannot be said that the "Father begets Himself," or that "He spirates Himself." Therefore, neither can it be said that "He loves Himself by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>," if "to love" is taken in a notional sense. Again, the love wherewith He loves us is not the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; because it imports a relation to creatures, and this belongs to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Therefore this also is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>: "The Father loves the Son by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. vi, 5): "The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is He whereby the Begotten is loved by the one begetting and loves His Begetter."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A difficulty about this question is objected to the effect that when we say, "the Father loves the Son by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>," since the ablative is construed as denoting a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, it seems to mean that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is the principle of love to the Father and the Son; which cannot be admitted.

<p>In view of this difficulty some have held that it is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, that "the Father and the Son love each other by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>"; and they add that it was retracted by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> when he retracted its equivalent to the effect that "the Father is wise by the Wisdom begotten." Others say that the proposition is inaccurate and ought to be expounded, as that "the Father loves the Son by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>"--that is, "by His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> Love," which is appropriated to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Others further say that this ablative should be construed as importing a sign, so that it means, "the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is the sign that the Father loves the Son"; inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> proceeds from them both, as Love. Others, again, say that this ablative must be construed as importing the relation of <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">formal</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is the love whereby the Father and the Son formally love each other. Others, again, say that it should be construed as importing the relation of a formal effect; and these approach nearer to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p>To make the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> clear, we must consider that since a thing is commonly denominated from its forms, as "white" from whiteness, and "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" from humanity; everything whence anything is denominated, in this particular respect stands to that thing in the relation of form. So when I say, "this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is clothed with a garment," the ablative is to be construed as having relation to the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">formal</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, although the garment is not the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Now it may happen that a thing may be denominated from that which proceeds from it, not only as an agent is from its action, but also as from the term itself of the action--that is, the effect, when the effect itself is included in the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the action. For we say that fire warms by heating, although heating is not the heat which is the form of the fire, but is an action proceeding from the fire; and we say that a tree flowers with the flower, although the flower is not the tree's form, but is the effect proceeding from the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. In this way, therefore, we must say that since in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "to love" is taken in two ways, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> and notionally, when it is taken <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, it means that the Father and the Son love each other not by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, but by their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xv, 7): "Who dares to say that the Father loves neither Himself, nor the Son, nor the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, except by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>?" The opinions first quoted are to be taken in this sense. But when the term Love is taken in a notional sense it means nothing else than "to spirate love"; just as to speak is to produce a word, and to flower is to produce flowers. As therefore we say that a tree flowers by its flower, so do we say that the Father, by the Word or the Son, speaks Himself, and His creatures; and that the Father and the Son love each other and us, by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, or by Love proceeding.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> To be wise or <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> is taken only <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; therefore we cannot say that "the Father is wise or <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>." But to love is taken not only <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, but also in a notional sense; and in this way, we can say that the Father and the Son love each other by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as was above explained.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of an action includes a determined effect, the principle of the action may be denominated both from the action, and from the effect; so we can say, for instance, that a tree flowers by its flowering and by its flower. When, however, the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of an action does not include a determined effect, then in that case, the principle of the action cannot be denominated from the effect, but only from the action. For we do not say that the tree produces the flower by the flower, but by the production of the flower. So when we say, "spirates" or "begets," this imports only a notional act. Hence we cannot say that the Father spirates by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, or begets by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. But we can say that the Father speaks by the Word, as by the Person proceeding, "and speaks by the speaking," as by a notional act; forasmuch as "to speak" imports a determinate <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> proceeding; since "to speak" means to produce a word. Likewise to love, taken in a notional sense, means to produce love; and so it can be said that the Father loves the Son by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as by the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> proceeding, and by Love itself as a notional act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The Father loves not only the Son, but also Himself and us, by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; because, as above explained, to love, taken in a notional sense, not only imports the production of a divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, but also the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> produced, by way of love, which has relation to the object loved. Hence, as the Father speaks Himself and every creature by His begotten Word, inasmuch as the Word "begotten" adequately represents the Father and every creature; so He loves Himself and every creature by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> proceeds as the love of the primal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> whereby the Father loves Himself and every creature. Thus it is evident that relation to the creature is implied both in the Word and in the proceeding Love, as it were in a secondary way, inasmuch as the divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> are a principle of understanding and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> all creatures.
