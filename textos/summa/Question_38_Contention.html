<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether contention is a mortal sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that contention is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For there is no mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> men: and yet contention is to be found in them, according to <a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse24">Luke 22:24</a>: "And there was also a strife amongst" the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, "which of them should . . . be the greatest." Therefore contention is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no well disposed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be pleased that his neighbor commit a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse17">Philippians 1:17</a>): "Some out of contention preach <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>," and afterwards he says (<a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse18">Philippians 1:18</a>): "In this also I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice." Therefore contention is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it happens that people contend either in the courts or in disputations, without any spiteful purpose, and with a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, as, for example, those who contend by disputing with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Hence a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/1sa014.htm#verse1">1 Samuel 14:1</a>, "It came to pass one day," etc. says: "Catholics do not raise contentions with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, unless they are first challenged to dispute." Therefore contention is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08413a.htm">Job</a> seems to have contended with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/job039.htm#verse32">Job 39:32</a>: "Shall he that contendeth with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be so easily silenced?" And yet <a href="../cathen/08413a.htm">Job</a> was not guilty of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, since the Lord said of him (<a href="../bible/job042.htm#verse7">Job 42:7</a>): "You have not spoken the thing that is right before me, as my servant <a href="../cathen/08413a.htm">Job</a> hath." Therefore contention is not always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is against the precept of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> who says (<a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse14">2 Timothy 2:14</a>): "Contend not in words." Moreover (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse20">Galatians 5:20</a>) contention is included among the works of the flesh, and as stated there (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse21">Galatians 5:21</a>) "they who do such things shall not obtain the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>." Now whatever excludes a man from the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> and is against a precept, is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore contention is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> To contend is to tend against some one. Wherefore just as discord denotes a contrariety of wills, so contention signifies contrariety of speech. For this reason when a man contrasts various contrary things in a speech, this is called "contentio," which Tully calls one of the rhetorical colors (De Rhet. ad Heren. iv), where he says that "it consists in developing a speech from contrary things," for instance: "Adulation has a pleasant beginning, and a most bitter end."

<p>Now contrariety of speech may be looked at in two ways: first with regard to the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the contentious party, secondly, with regard to the manner of contending. As to the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, we must consider whether he contends against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and then he is to be blamed, or against falsehood, and then he should be praised. As to the manner, we must consider whether his manner of contending is in keeping with the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in dispute, for then it would be praiseworthy, hence Tully says (De Rhet. ad Heren. iii) that "contention is a sharp speech suitable for <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> and refutation"--or whether it exceeds the demands of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in dispute, in which case it is blameworthy.

<p>Accordingly if we take contention as denoting a disclaimer of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and an inordinate manner, it is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Thus <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> [Cf. Gloss. Ord. in Rom. i, 29 defines contention: "Contention is a disclaimer of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> with clamorous confidence." If, however, contention denote a disavowal of what is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, with the proper measure of acrimony, it is praiseworthy: whereas, if it denote a disavowal of falsehood, together with an inordinate manner, it can be a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, unless the contention be conducted so inordinately, as to give <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> to others. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> after saying (<a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse14">2 Timothy 2:14</a>): "Contend not in words," adds, "for it is to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> contended together, not with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of disclaiming the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, since each one stood up for what he thought was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Yet there was inordinateness in their contention, because they contended about a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> which they ought not to have contended about, viz. the primacy of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>; for they were not <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> men as yet, as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says on the same passage; and for this reason <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> checked them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Those who preached <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> "out of contention," were to be blamed, because, although they did not gainsay the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but preached it, yet they did gainsay the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, by the fact that they thought they would "raise affliction" to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> who was preaching the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> rejoiced not in their contention, but in the fruit that would result therefrom, namely that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> would be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>--since <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is sometimes the occasion of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> results.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Contention is complete and is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> when, in contending before a judge, a man gainsays the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, or in a disputation, intends to impugn the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> doctrine. On this sense <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> do not contend against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, but the reverse. But when, whether in court or in a disputation, it is incomplete, i.e. in respect of the acrimony of speech, it is not always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Contention here denotes an ordinary dispute. For <a href="../cathen/08413a.htm">Job</a> had said (13:3): "I will speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>": yet he intended not to impugn the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but to defend it, and in seeking the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> thus, he had no wish to be inordinate in mind or in speech.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether contention is a daughter of vainglory?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that contention is not a daughter of vainglory. For contention is akin to zeal, wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse3">1 Corinthians 3:3</a>): "Whereas there is among you zeal [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'envying'] and contention, are you not carnal, and walk according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>?" Now zeal pertains to <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>. Therefore contention arises rather from <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, contention is accompanied by raising of the voice. But the voice is raised on account of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> declares (Moral. xxxi, 14). Therefore contention too arises from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, among other things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> seems to be the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and vainglory, according to <a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse1">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowledge</a> puffeth up." Now contention is often due to lack of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> we do not impugn the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it. Therefore contention is not a daughter of vainglory.

<p><strong>On the contrary</strong> stands the authority of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi, 14).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 37, Article 2), discord is a daughter of vainglory, because each of the disaccording parties clings to his own opinion, rather than acquiesce with the other. Now it is proper to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and vainglory to seek one's own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. And just as people are discordant when they hold to their own opinion in their hearts, so are they contentious when each defends his own opinion by words. Consequently contention is reckoned a daughter of vainglory for the same reason as discord.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Contention, like discord, is akin to <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> in so far as a man severs himself from the one with whom he is discordant, or with whom he contends, but in so far as a contentious <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> holds to something, it is akin to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and vainglory, because, to wit, he clings to his own opinion, as stated above (37, 2, ad 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The contention of which we are speaking puts on a loud voice, for the purpose of impugning the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, so that it is not the chief part of contention. Hence it does not follow that contention arises from the same source as the raising of the voice.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Pride and vainglory are occasioned chiefly by goods even those that are contrary to them, for instance, when a man is <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> of his <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>: for when a thing arises in this way, it does so not directly but <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, in which way nothing hinders one contrary from arising out of another. Hence there is no reason why the "per se" and direct effects of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> or vainglory, should not result from the contraries of those things which are the occasion of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>.
