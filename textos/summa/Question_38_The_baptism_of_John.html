<ol><li><a href="../summa/4038.htm#article1"> Was it fitting that John should baptize?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4038.htm#article2"> Was that baptism from God?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4038.htm#article3"> Did it confer grace?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4038.htm#article4"> Should others besides Christ have received that baptism?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4038.htm#article5"> Should that baptism have ceased when Christ was baptized?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4038.htm#article6"> Did those who received John's baptism have to afterwards receive Christ's baptism?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether it was fitting that John should baptize?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it was not fitting that John should <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>. For every sacramental rite belongs to some <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. But John did not introduce a new <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Therefore it was not fitting that he should introduce the new rite of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, John "was sent by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> . . . for a witness" (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse6">John 1:6-7</a>) as a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>; according to <a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse76">Luke 1:76</a>: "Thou, child, shalt be called the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of the Highest." But the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> who lived before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not introduce any new rite, but persuaded men to observe the rites of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. as is clearly stated <a href="../bible/mal004.htm#verse4">Malachi 4:4</a>: "Remember the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> My servant." Therefore neither should John have introduced a new rite of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, when there is too much of anything, nothing should be added to it. But the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> observed a superfluity of baptisms; for it is written (<a href="../bible/mar007.htm#verse3">Mark 7:3-4</a>) that "the Pharisees and all the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> eat not without often washing their hands . . . and when they come from the market, unless they be washed, they eat not; and many other things there are that have been delivered to them to observe, the washings of cups and of pots, and of brazen vessels, and of beds." Therefore it was unfitting that John should <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary</strong> is the authority of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> (<a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse5">Matthew 3:5-6</a>), which, after stating the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of John, adds many went out to him, "and were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the Jordan."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It was fitting for John to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, for four reasons: first, it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by John, in order that He might sanctify <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> observes, super Joan. (Tract. xiii in Joan.).

<p>Secondly, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> might be manifested. Whence John himself says (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse31">John 1:31</a>): "That He," i.e. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, "may be made manifest in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, therefore am I come <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> with water." For he announced <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to the crowds that gathered around him; which was thus done much more easily than if he had gone in search of each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> observes, commenting on <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">St. John</a> (Hom. x in Matth.).

<p>Thirdly, that by his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> he might accustom men to the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ; wherefore <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says in a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> (Hom. vii in Evang.) that therefore did John <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, "that, being consistent with his office of precursor, as he had preceded <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> in birth, so he might also by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> precede Him who was about to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>."

<p>Fourthly, that by persuading men to do penance, he might prepare men to receive worthily the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> [Cf. Scot. Erig. in Joan. iii, 24] says that "the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John was as profitable before the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as instruction in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> profits the catechumens not yet <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. For just as he preached penance, and foretold the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and drew men to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Truth that hath appeared to the world, so do the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, after instructing men, chide them for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and lastly promise them forgiveness in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John was not a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> properly so called [per se, but a kind of sacramental, preparatory to the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Consequently, in a way, it belonged to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but not to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> John was not only a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, but "more than a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>," as stated <a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse9">Matthew 11:9</a>: for he was the term of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> and the beginning of the Gospel. Therefore it was in his province to lead men, both by word and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> rather than to the observance of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Those baptisms of the Pharisees were vain, being ordered merely unto carnal cleanliness. But the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John was ordered unto <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> cleanliness, since it led men to do penance, as stated above.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the baptism of John was from God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John was not from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For nothing sacramental that is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is named after a mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: thus the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is not named after Peter or <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, but after <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is named after John, according to <a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse25">Matthew 21:25</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John . . . was it from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> or from men?" Therefore the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John was not from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every doctrine that proceeds from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> anew is confirmed by some signs: thus the Lord (<a href="../bible/exo004.htm">Exodus 4</a>) gave <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> the power of working signs; and it is written (<a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse3">Hebrews 2:3-4</a>) that our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> "having begun to be declared by the Lord, was confirmed unto us by them that heard Him, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> also bearing them witness by signs and wonders." But it is written of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a> (<a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse41">John 10:41</a>) that "John did no sign." Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> wherewith he <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> was not from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, those <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which are instituted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are contained in certain precepts of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Scripture</a>. But there is no precept of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> commanding the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John. Therefore it seems that it was not from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse33">John 1:33</a>): "He who sent me to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> with water said to me: 'He upon whom thou shalt see the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>,'" etc.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Two things may be considered in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John--namely, the rite of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and the effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. The rite of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was not from men, but from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who by an interior <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> sent John to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>. But the effect of that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, because it effected nothing that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> could not accomplish. Wherefore it was not from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, except in as far as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> works in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> By the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> men are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> inwardly by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and this is accomplished by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. But by the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John the body alone was cleansed by the water. Wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse11">Matthew 3:11</a>): "I <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> you in water; but . . . He shall <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> you in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." For this reason the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John was named after him, because it effected nothing that he did not accomplish. But the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is not named after the minister thereof, because he does not accomplish its principal effect, which is the inward cleansing.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The whole teaching and work of John was ordered unto <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who, by many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> confirmed both His own teaching and that of John. But if John had worked signs, men would have paid equal attention to John and to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Wherefore, in order that men might pay greater attention to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, it was not given to John to work a sign. Yet when the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> asked him why he <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, he confirmed his office by the authority of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>, saying: "I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness," etc. as related, <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse23">John 1:23</a> (cf. <a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse3">Isaiah 40:3</a>). Moreover, the very austerity of his life was a commendation of his office, because, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says, commenting on Matthew (Hom. x in Matth.), "it was wonderful to witness such endurance in a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John was intended by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to last only for a short time, for the reasons given above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore it was not the subject of a general commandment set down in Sacred Writ, but of a certain interior <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as stated above.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether grace was given in the baptism of John?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was given in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John. For it is written (<a href="../bible/mar001.htm#verse4">Mark 1:4</a>): "John was in the desert <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> and preaching the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of penance unto remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." But penance and remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are the effect of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John conferred <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, those who were about to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by John "confessed their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>," as related <a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse6">Matthew 3:6</a> and <a href="../bible/mar001.htm#verse5">Mark 1:5</a>. But the confession of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is ordered to their remission, which is effected by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was conferred in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John was more akin than <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> was remitted through <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>: because, as <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> says (Hom. x in Circumcis.), "under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> brought the same saving aid to heal the wound of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is wont to bring now that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is revealed." Much more, therefore, did the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John effect the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which cannot be accomplished without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse11">Matthew 3:11</a>): "I indeed <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> you in water unto penance." Which words <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> thus expounds in a certain <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> (Hom. vii in Evang.): "John <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, not in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, but in water: because he could not forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." But <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is given by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and by means thereof <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are taken away. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John did not confer <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (2, ad 2), the whole teaching and work of John was in preparation for Christ: just as it is the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the servant and of the under-craftsman to prepare the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> for the form which is accomplished by the head-craftsman. Now <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was to be conferred on men through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse17">John 1:17</a>: "<a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> came through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John did not confer <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but only prepared the way for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; and this in three ways: first, by John's teaching, which led men to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; secondly, by accustoming men to the rite of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; thirdly, by penance, preparing men to receive the effect of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In these words, as <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> says (on <a href="../bible/mar001.htm#verse4">Mark 1:4</a>), a twofold <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of penance may be understood. one is that which John conferred by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>, which is called "a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of penance," etc., by reason of its inducing men to do penance, and of its being a kind of protestation by which men avowed their purpose of doing penance. The other is the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by which <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are remitted, and which John could not give, but only preach, saying: "He will <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> you in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>."

<p>Or it may be said that he preached the "<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of penance," i.e. which induced men to do penance, which penance leads men on to "the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>."

<p>Or again, it may be said with <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> [Another author on <a href="../bible/mar001.htm">Mark 1</a> (inter op. Hier.)] that "by the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is given, by which <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are remitted gratis; and that what is accomplished by the bridegroom is begun by the bridesman," i.e. by John. Consequently it is said that "he <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and preached the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of penance unto remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>," not as though he accomplished this himself, but because he began it by preparing the way for it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> That confession of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> was not made unto the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, to be realized immediately through the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John, but to be obtained through subsequent penance and through the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, for which that penance was a preparation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Circumcision was instituted as a remedy for <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. Whereas the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John was not instituted for this purpose, but was merely in preparation for the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as stated above; whereas the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> attain their effect through the force of their institution.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether Christ alone should have been baptized with the baptism of John?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> alone should have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John. For, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), "the reason why John <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> was that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> might receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Super Joan., Tract. xiii). But what is proper to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should not be applicable to others. Therefore no others should have received that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whoever is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> either receives something from the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> or confers something on the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. But no one could receive anything from the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John, because thereby <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was not conferred, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). On the other hand, no one could confer anything on <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> save Christ, who "sanctified the waters by the touch of His most pure flesh" [Mag. Sent. iv, 3]. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> alone should have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if others were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, this was only in order that they might be prepared for the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ: and thus it would seem fitting that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John should be conferred on all, old and young, <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> and <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jew</a>, just as the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But we do not read that either children or <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by the latter; for it is written (<a href="../bible/mar001.htm#verse5">Mark 1:5</a>) that "there went out to him . . . all they of Jerusalem, and were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by him." Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> alone should have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by John.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/luk003.htm#verse21">Luke 3:21</a>): "It came to pass, when all the people were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> also being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> was opened."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> For two reasons it behooved others besides <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John. First, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Super Joan., Tract. iv, v), "if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> alone had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John, some would have said that John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, with which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, was more excellent than that of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, with which others are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>."

<p>Secondly, because, as above stated, it behooved others to be prepared by John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> for the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John was instituted not only that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> might be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, but also for other reasons, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). And yet, even if it were instituted merely in order that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> might be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> therewith, it was still <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for others to receive this <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, in order to avoid the objection mentioned above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Others who approached to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by John could not, indeed, confer anything on his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>: yet neither did they receive anything therefrom, save only the sign of penance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This was the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of "penance," for which children were not suited; wherefore they were not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> therewith. But to bring the nations into the way of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> was reserved to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> alone, who is the "expectation of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>," as we read <a href="../bible/gen049.htm#verse10">Genesis 49:10</a>. Indeed, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> forbade the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> to preach the Gospel to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> before His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> and <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>. Much less fitting, therefore, was it for the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by John.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether John's baptism should have ceased after Christ was baptized?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> should have ceased after <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse31">John 1:31</a>): "That He may be made manifest in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, therefore am I come <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> in water." But when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, He was made sufficiently manifest, both by the testimony of John and by the dove coming down upon Him, and again by the voice of the Father bearing witness to Him. Therefore it seems that John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> should not have endured thereafter.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Super Joan., Tract. iv): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> ceased to avail." Therefore it seems that, after Christ's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, John should not have continued to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> prepared the way for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> began as soon as He had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; because "by the touch of His most pure flesh He endowed the waters with a regenerating <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>," as <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> asserts (Mag. Sent. iv, 3). Therefore it seems that John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> ceased when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse22">John 3:22-23</a>): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> . . . came into the land of Judea . . . and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>: and John also was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> before being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. Therefore it seems that John continued to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> after <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It was not fitting for the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John to cease when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. First, because, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. xxix in Joan.), "if John had ceased to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>" when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, "men would think that he was moved by jealousy or <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>." Secondly, if he had ceased to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, "he would have given His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> a motive for yet greater <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>." Thirdly, because, by continuing to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, "he sent his hearers to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>" (Hom. xxix in Joan.). Fourthly, because, as <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> [Scot. Erig. Comment. in Joan.] says, "there still remained a shadow of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>: nor should the forerunner withdraw until the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> be made manifest."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> When <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, He was not as yet fully manifested: consequently there was still need for John to continue <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John ceased after <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, not immediately, but when the former was cast into prison. Thus <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. xxix in Joan.): "I consider that John's death was allowed to take place, and that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> preaching began in a great measure after John had died, so that the undivided allegiance of the multitude was transferred to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and there was no further motive for the divergence of opinions concerning both of them."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> prepared the way not only for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, but also for others to approach to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>: and this did not take place as soon as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether those who had been baptized with John's baptism had to be baptized with the baptism of Christ?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that those who had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> had not to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For John was not less than the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, since of him is it written (<a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse11">Matthew 11:11</a>): "There hath not risen among them that are born of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> a greater than <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a>." But those who were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again, but only received the imposition of hands; for it is written (<a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse16">Acts 8:16-17</a>) that some were "only <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>" by Philip "in the name of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>": then the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>--namely, Peter and John--"laid their hands upon them, and they received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." Therefore it seems that those who had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by John had not to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, since some of them were his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, as is clear from <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse37">John 1:37</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> do not seem to have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ: for it is written (<a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse2">John 4:2</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> did not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, but His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>." Therefore it seems that those who had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> had not to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, he who is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> is less than he who baptizes. But we are not told that John himself was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore much less did those who had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by John need to receive the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/act019.htm#verse1">Acts 19:1-5</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> . . . found certain <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>; and he said to them: Have you received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> since ye <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>? But they said to him: We have not so much as heard whether there be a <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. And he said: In what then were you <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>? Who said: In John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>." Wherefore "they were" again "<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of our [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'the'] <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>." Hence it seems that they needed to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again, because they did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on <a href="../bible/joe002.htm#verse28">Joel 2:28</a> and in an epistle (lxix De Viro unius uxoris), and likewise <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> (De Spiritu Sancto). But some were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> who had full <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>. Therefore these had no need to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, on <a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse8">Romans 10:8</a>, "This is the word of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which we preach," the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says: "Whence this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in the water, that it touches the body and cleanses the heart, save by the efficacy of the word, not because it is uttered, but because it is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>?" Whence it is clear that the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> depends on <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But the form of John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> signified the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in which we are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; for <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says (<a href="../bible/act019.htm#verse4">Acts 19:4</a>): "John <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> the people with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of penance, saying: That they should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him who was to come after him--that is to say, in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>." Therefore it seems that those who had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> had no need to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Super Joan., Tract. v): "Those who were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> needed to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to the opinion of the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> (Sent. iv, D, 2), "those who had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by John without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and who based their hopes on his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, were afterwards <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ: but those who did not base their hope on John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the Father, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, were not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> afterwards, but received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> by the imposition of hands made over them by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>."

<p>And this, indeed, is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> as to the first part, and is confirmed by many authorities. But as to the second part, the assertion is altogether unreasonable. First, because John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> neither conferred <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> nor imprinted a character, but was merely "in water," as he says himself (<a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse11">Matthew 3:11</a>). Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or hope which the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> had in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> could not supply this defect. Secondly, because, when in a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, that is omitted which belongs of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, not only must the omission be supplied, but the whole must be entirely renewed. Now, it belongs of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> that it be given not only in water, but also in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse5">John 3:5</a>: "Unless a man be born of water and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, he cannot enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>." Wherefore in the case of those who had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in water only, not merely had the omission to be supplied by giving them the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> by the imposition of hands, but they had to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> wholly anew "in water and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Super Joan., Tract. v): "After John, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was administered, and the reason why was because he gave not Christ's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, but his own . . . That which Peter gave . . . and if any were given by <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a>, that was Christ's. And therefore if <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> anyone, yet were they not rebaptized . . . For the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> corresponds with him by whose authority it is given, not with him by whose ministry it is given." For the same reason those who were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Philip, who gave the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, were not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again, but received the imposition of hands by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, just as those who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are confirmed by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says to Seleucianus (Ep. cclxv), "we deem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> either with John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, as some maintain, or with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which is more probable. For He would not fail to administer <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> so as to have <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> servants through whom He <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> others, since He did not fail in His <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> service to wash their feet."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. iv in Matth. [From the supposititious Opus Imperfectum): "Since, when John said, 'I ought to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by Thee,' <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> answered, 'Suffer it to be so now': it follows that afterwards <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> John." Moreover, he asserts that "this is distinctly set down in some of the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> books." At any rate, it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on <a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse13">Matthew 3:13</a>, that, "as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in water by John, so had John to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The reason why these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> after being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by John was not only because they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, but also because they had not received the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Faust. xix), our <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are signs of present <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, whereas the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> were signs of future <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Wherefore the very fact that John <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of one who was to come, shows that he did not give the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>.
