<h1>Question 38. The name of the Holy Ghost, as Gift</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1038.htm#article1"> Can "Gift" be a personal name?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1038.htm#article2"> Is it the proper name of the Holy Ghost?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether "Gift" is a personal name?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that "Gift" is not a personal name. For every personal name imports a distinction in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But the name of "Gift" does not import a distinction in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xv, 19): that "the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is so given as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> Gift, that He also gives Himself as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore "Gift" is not a personal name.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no personal name belongs to the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. But the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is the Gift which the Father gives to the Son, as <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (De Trin. ix). Therefore "Gift" is not a personal name.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. iv, 19) there is no subjection nor service in the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> implies a subjection both as regards him to whom it is given, and as regards him by whom it is given. Therefore "Gift" is not a personal name.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, "Gift" imports relation to the creature, and it thus seems to be said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. But personal names are said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>; as "Father," and "Son." Therefore "Gift" is not a personal name.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xv, 19): "As the body of flesh is nothing but flesh; so the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is nothing but the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is a personal name; so also therefore is "Gift."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The word "<a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>" imports an aptitude for being given. And what is given has an aptitude or relation both to the giver and to that to which it is given. For it would not be given by anyone, unless it was his to give; and it is given to someone to be his. Now a divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is said to belong to another, either by origin, as the Son belongs to the Father; or as possessed by another. But we are said to possess what we can freely use or enjoy as we please: and in this way a divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> cannot be possessed, except by a rational creature united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Other creatures can be moved by a divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, not, however, in such a way as to be able to enjoy the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and to use the effect thereof. The rational creature does sometimes attain thereto; as when it is made partaker of the divine Word and of the Love proceeding, so as freely to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> and to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> rightly. Hence the rational creature alone can possess the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Nevertheless in order that it may possess Him in this manner, its own power avails nothing: hence this must be given it from above; for that is said to be given to us which we have from another source. Thus a divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> can "be given," and can be a "<a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The name "Gift" imports a personal distinction, in so far as <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> imports something belonging to another through its origin. Nevertheless, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> gives Himself, inasmuch as He is His own, and can use or rather enjoy Himself; as also a free <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> belongs to himself. And as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (In Joan. Tract. xxix): "What is more yours than yourself?" Or we might say, and more fittingly, that a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> must belong in a way to the giver. But the phrase, "this is this one's," can be understood in several senses. In one way it means identity, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (In Joan. Tract. xxix); and in that sense "<a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>" is the same as "the giver," but not the same as the one to whom it is given. The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> gives Himself in that sense. In another sense, a thing is another's as a possession, or as a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a>; and in that sense <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> distinct from the giver; and the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> so taken is a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> thing. In a third sense "this is this one's" through its origin only; and in this sense the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is the Father's; and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> belongs to both. Therefore, so far as <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> in this way signifies the possession of the giver, it is personally distinguished from the giver, and is a personal name.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is the Father's <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> in the first sense, as being the Father's by way of identity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Gift as a personal name in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not imply subjection, but only origin, as regards the giver; but as regards the one to whom it is given, it implies a free use, or enjoyment, as above explained.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Gift is not so called from being actually given, but from its aptitude to be given. Hence the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is called Gift from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, although He is given in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Nor does it follow that it is an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> name because it imports relation to the creature; but that it includes something <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> in its meaning; as the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is included in the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, as stated above (Question 34, Article 3).

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether "Gift" is the proper name of the Holy Ghost?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that Gift is not the proper name of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. For the name Gift comes from being given. But, as <a href="../bible/isa009.htm#verse16">Isaiah 9:16</a> says: "A Son is give to us." Therefore to be Gift belongs to the Son, as well as to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every proper name of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> signifies a property. But this word Gift does not signify a property of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Therefore Gift is not a proper name of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> can be called the spirit of a man, whereas He cannot be called the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> Gift" only. Therefore Gift is not the proper name of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iv, 20): "As 'to be born' is, for the Son, to be from the Father, so, for the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, 'to be the Gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>' is to proceed from Father and Son." But the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> receives His proper name from the fact that He proceeds from Father and Son. Therefore Gift is the proper name of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Gift, taken personally in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is the proper name of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this we must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> is properly an unreturnable giving, as <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> says (Topic. iv, 4)--i.e. a thing which is not given with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of a return--and it thus contains the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a gratuitous donation. Now, the reason of donation being gratuitous is love; since therefore do we give something to anyone gratuitously forasmuch as we wish him well. So what we first give him is the love whereby we wish him well. Hence it is manifest that love has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a first <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, through which all free <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are given. So since the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> proceeds as love, as stated above (27, 4; 37, 1), He proceeds as the first <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xv, 24): "By the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, many particular <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are portioned out to the members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is properly called the Image because He proceeds by way of a word, whose <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> it is to be the similitude of its principle, although the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> also is like to the Father; so also, because the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> proceeds from the Father as love, He is properly called Gift, although the Son, too, is given. For that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is given is from the Father's love, according to the words, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> so loved the world, as to give His only begotten Son" (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse16">John 3:16</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The name Gift involves the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of belonging to the Giver through its origin; and thus it imports the property of the origin of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>--that is, His procession.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Before a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> is given, it belongs only to the giver; but when it is given, it is his to whom it is given. Therefore, because "Gift" does not import the actual giving, it cannot be called a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but the Gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> giving. When, however, it has been given, then it is the spirit of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, or a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> bestowed on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.
