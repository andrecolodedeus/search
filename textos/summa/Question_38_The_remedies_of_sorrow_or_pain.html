<h1>Question 38. The remedies of sorrow or pain</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2038.htm#article1"> Is pain or sorrow assuaged by every pleasure?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2038.htm#article2"> Is it assuaged by weeping?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2038.htm#article3"> Is it assuaged by the sympathy of friends?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2038.htm#article4"> Is it assuaged by contemplating the truth?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2038.htm#article5"> Is it assuaged by sleep and baths?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether pain or sorrow is assuaged by every pleasure?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that not every pleasure assuages every pain or sorrow. For pleasure does not assuage sorrow, save in so far as it is contrary to it: for "remedies work by contraries" (Ethic. ii, 3). But not every pleasure is contrary to every sorrow; as stated above (Question 35, Article 4). Therefore not every pleasure assuages every sorrow.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> sorrow does not assuage it. But some pleasures <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> sorrow; since, as stated in Ethic. ix, 4, "the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> feels pain at having been pleased." Therefore not every pleasure assuages sorrow.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. iv, 7) that he fled from his country, where he had been wont to associate with his friend, now dead: "for so should his eyes look for him less, where they were not wont to see him." Hence we may gather that those things which united us to our dead or absent friends, become burdensome to us when we mourn their death or absence. But nothing united us more than the pleasures we enjoyed in common. Therefore these very pleasures become burdensome to us when we mourn. Therefore not every pleasure assuages every sorrow.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 14) that "sorrow is driven forth by pleasure, both by a contrary pleasure and by any other, provided it be intense."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As is evident from what has been said above (Question 23, Article 4), pleasure is a kind of repose of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> in a suitable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; while sorrow arises from something unsuited to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Consequently in movements of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> pleasure is to sorrow, what, in bodies, repose is to weariness, which is due to a non-<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> transmutation; for sorrow itself implies a certain weariness or ailing of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> faculty. Therefore just as all repose of the body brings relief to any kind of weariness, ensuing from any non-<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; so every pleasure brings relief by assuaging any kind of sorrow, due to any <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> whatever.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although not every pleasure is specifically contrary to every sorrow, yet it is generically, as stated above (Question 35, Article 4). And consequently, on the part of the disposition of the subject, any sorrow can be assuaged by any pleasure.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The pleasures of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men are not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sorrow while they are enjoyed, but afterwards: that is to say, in so far as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men repent of those things in which they took pleasure. This sorrow is healed by contrary pleasures.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> When there are two <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> inclining to contrary movements, each hinders the other; yet the one which is stronger and more persistent, prevails in the end. Now when a man is made sorrowful by those things in which he took pleasure in common with a deceased or absent friend, there are two <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> producing contrary movements. For the thought of the friend's death or absence, inclines him to sorrow: whereas the present <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> inclines him to pleasure. Consequently each is modified by the other. And yet, since the perception of the present moves more strongly than the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> of the past, and since love of self is more persistent than love of another; hence it is that, in the end, the pleasure drives out the sorrow. Wherefore a little further on (Confess. iv, 8) <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says that his "sorrow gave way to his former pleasures."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether pain or sorrow is assuaged by tears?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that tears do not assuage sorrow. Because no effect diminishes its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But tears or groans are an effect of sorrow. Therefore they do not diminish sorrow.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as tears or groans are an effect of sorrow, so laughter is an effect of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. But laughter does not lessen <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. Therefore tears do not lessen sorrow.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, when we weep, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that saddens us is present to the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>. But the image of that which saddens us increases sorrow, just as the image of a pleasant thing adds to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. Therefore it seems that tears do not assuage sorrow.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. iv, 7) that when he mourned the death of his friend, "in groans and in tears alone did he find some little refreshment."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Tears and groans <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> assuage sorrow: and this for two reasons. First, because a hurtful thing hurts yet more if we keep it shut up, because the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is more intent on it: whereas if it be allowed to escape, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is dispersed as it were on outward things, so that the inward sorrow is lessened. This is why men, burdened with sorrow, make outward show of their sorrow, by tears or groans or even by words, their sorrow is assuaged. Secondly, because an action, that befits a man according to his actual disposition, is always pleasant to him. Now tears and groans are actions befitting a man who is in sorrow or pain; and consequently they become pleasant to him. Since then, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), every pleasure assuages sorrow or pain somewhat, it follows that sorrow is assuaged by weeping and groans.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This relation of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to effect is opposed to the relation <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> between the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sorrow and the sorrowing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For every effect is suited to its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and consequently is pleasant to it; but the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sorrow is disagreeable to him that sorrows. Hence the effect of sorrow is not related to him that sorrows in the same way as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sorrow is. For this reason sorrow is assuaged by its effect, on account of the aforesaid contrariety.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The relation of effect to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is like the relation of the object of pleasure to him that takes pleasure in it: because in each case the one agrees with the other. Now every like thing increases its like. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is increased by laughter and the other effects of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>: except they be excessive, in which case, <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, they lessen it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The image of that which saddens us, considered in itself, has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> tendency to increase sorrow: yet from the very fact that a man imagines himself to be doing that which is fitting according to his actual state, he feels a certain amount of pleasure. For the same reason if laughter escapes a man when he is so disposed that he thinks he ought to weep, he is sorry for it, as having done something unbecoming to him, as Cicero says (De Tusc. Quaest. iii, 27).

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether pain or sorrow are assuaged by the sympathy of friends?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the sorrow of sympathizing friends does not assuage our own sorrow. For contraries have contrary effects. Now as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. viii, 4), "when many rejoice together, each one has more exuberant <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, for they are kindled and inflamed one by the other." Therefore, in like manner, when many are sorrowful, it seems that their sorrow is greater.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, friendship demands mutual love, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> declares (Confess. iv, 9). But a sympathizing friend is pained at the sorrow of his friend with whom he sympathizes. Consequently the pain of a sympathizing friend becomes, to the friend in sorrow, a further <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sorrow: so that, his pain being doubled his sorrow seems to increase.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, sorrow arises from every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> affecting a friend, as though it affected oneself: since "a friend is one's other self" (Ethic. ix, 4,9). But sorrow is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore the sorrow of the sympathizing friend increases the sorrow of the friend with whom he sympathizes.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ix, 11) that those who are in pain are consoled when their friends sympathize with them.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> When one is in pain, it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> that the sympathy of a friend should afford consolation: whereof the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> indicates a twofold reason (Ethic. ix, 11). The first is because, since sorrow has a depressing effect, it is like a weight whereof we strive to unburden ourselves: so that when a man sees others saddened by his own sorrow, it seems as though others were bearing the burden with him, striving, as it were, to lessen its weight; wherefore the load of sorrow becomes lighter for him: something like what occurs in the carrying of bodily burdens. The second and better reason is because when a man's friends condole with him, he sees that he is loved by them, and this affords him pleasure, as stated above (Question 32, Article 5). Consequently, since every pleasure assuages sorrow, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), it follows that sorrow is mitigated by a sympathizing friend.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In either case there is a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of friendship, viz. when a man rejoices with the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joyful</a>, and when he sorrows with the sorrowful. Consequently each becomes an object of pleasure by reason of its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The friend's sorrow itself would be a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sorrow: but consideration of its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, viz. his love, gives rise rather to pleasure.

<p>And this suffices for the reply to the Third Objection.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether pain and sorrow are assuaged by the contemplation of truth?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> does not assuage sorrow. For it is written (<a href="../bible/ecc001.htm#verse18">Ecclesiastes 1:18</a>): "He that addeth <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> addeth also sorrow" [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'labor']. But <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> pertains to the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> does not assuage sorrow.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> belongs to the speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. But "the speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not a principle of movement"; as stated in De Anima iii, 11. Therefore, since <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and sorrow are movements of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, it seems that the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> does not help to assuage sorrow.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the remedy for an ailment should be applied to the part which ails. But <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore it does not assuage bodily pain, which is in the senses.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Soliloq. i, 12): "It seemed to me that if the light of that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> were to dawn on our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a>, either I should not feel that pain, or at least that pain would seem nothing to me."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 3, Article 5), the greatest of all pleasures consists in the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Now every pleasure assuages pain as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>): hence the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> assuages pain or sorrow, and the more so, the more perfectly one is a lover of wisdom. And therefore in the midst of tribulations men rejoice in the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of Divine things and of future Happiness, according to <a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse2">James 1:2</a>: "My brethren, count it all <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, when you shall fall into divers <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>": and, what is more, even in the midst of bodily tortures this <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is found; as the "<a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Tiburtius, when he was walking barefoot on the burning coals, said: Methinks, I walk on roses, in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>." [Cf. <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, August 11th, commemoration of <a href="../cathen/14720a.htm">St. Tiburtius</a>.]

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> "He that addeth <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, addeth sorrow," either on account of the difficulty and disappointment in the search for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; or because <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> makes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> acquainted with many things that are contrary to his will. Accordingly, on the part of the things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> sorrow: but on the part of the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> pleasure.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> does not move the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> on the part of the thing contemplated: but on the part of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> itself, which is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> pleasant to him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> there is an overflow from the higher to the lower powers: and accordingly, the pleasure of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, which is in the higher part, overflows so as to mitigate even that pain which is in the senses.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether pain and sorrow are assuaged by sleep and baths?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that sleep and baths do not assuage sorrow. For sorrow is in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: whereas sleep and baths regard the body. Therefore they do not conduce to the assuaging of sorrow.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the same effect does not seem to ensue from contrary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. But these, being bodily things, are incompatible with the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the assuaging of sorrow, as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>). Therefore sorrow is not mitigated by the like.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, sorrow and pain, in so far as they affect the body, denote a certain transmutation of the heart. But such remedies as these seem to pertain to the outward senses and limbs, rather than to the interior disposition of the heart. Therefore they do not assuage sorrow.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. ix, 12): "I had heard that the bath had its name [Balneum, from the Greek <em>balaneion</em>] . . . from the fact of its driving sadness from the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>." And further on, he says: "I slept, and woke up again, and found my grief not a little assuaged": and quotes the words from the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> of <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> [Cf. Sarum <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>: First Sunday after the octave of the Epiphany, Hymn for first Vespers], in which it is said that "Sleep restores the tired limbs to labor, refreshes the weary mind, and banishes sorrow."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 37, Article 4), sorrow, by reason of its specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, is repugnant to the vital movement of the body; and consequently whatever restores the bodily <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to its due state of vital movement, is opposed to sorrow and assuages it. Moreover such remedies, from the very fact that they bring <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> back to its normal state, are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of pleasure; for this is precisely in what pleasure consists, as stated above (Question 31, Article 1). Therefore, since every pleasure assuages sorrow, sorrow is assuaged by such like bodily remedies.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The normal disposition of the body, so far as it is felt, is itself a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure, and consequently assuages sorrow.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above (Question 31, Article 8), one pleasure hinders another; and yet every pleasure assuages sorrow. Consequently it is not unreasonable that sorrow should be assuaged by <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> which hinder one another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> disposition of the body reacts somewhat on the heart, which is the beginning and end of bodily movements, as stated in De Causa Mot. Animal. xi.
