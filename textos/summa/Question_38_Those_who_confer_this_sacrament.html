<h1>Question 38. Those who confer this sacrament</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5038.htm#article1"> Can a bishop alone confer this sacrament?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5038.htm#article2"> Can a heretic or any other person cut off from the Church confer this sacrament?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether a bishop alone confers the sacrament of Order?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that not only a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> confers the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacrament of Order</a>. For the imposition of hands has something to do with the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. Now not only the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> but also the assisting <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> lay hands on the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who are being ordained. Therefore not only a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> confers the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacrament of Order</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a man receives the power of Order, when that which pertains to the act of his Order is handed to him. Now the <a href="../cathen/04543a.htm">cruet</a> with water, bowl* and towel, are given to the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>; as also the <a href="../cathen/03248a.htm">candlestick</a> with candle, and the empty <a href="../cathen/04543a.htm">cruet</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolyte</a>. ["Bacili." The rubric has "aquamanili." Some texts of the Summa have "mantili" ("<a href="../cathen/09601b.htm">maniple</a>"), but the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> does not give the <a href="../cathen/09601b.htm">maniple</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>.] Therefore not only the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> confers the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacrament of Order</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that which belongs to an Order cannot be entrusted to one who has not the Order. Now the conferring of <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor Orders</a> is entrusted to certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are not <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, for instance to Cardinal <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Therefore the conferring of Orders does not belong to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> Order.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, whoever is entrusted with the principal is entrusted with the accessory also. Now the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacrament of Order</a> is directed to the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, as accessory to principal. Since then a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> consecrates the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, he can also confer Orders.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, there is a greater distinction between a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> than between <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. But a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> can <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> can ordain a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Ministers are applied by their Orders to the Divine worship in a more noble way than the sacred vessels. But the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the vessels belongs to a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> only. Much more therefore does the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of ministers.

<p>Further, the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacrament of Order</a> ranks higher than the <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">sacrament of Confirmation</a>. Now a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> alone confirms. Much more therefore does a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> alone confer the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacrament of Order</a>.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> are not placed in a degree of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power by their <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, as the ordained are. Yet a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> alone can <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. Therefore much more can he alone ordain.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> power stands in the same relation to the power of the lower Orders, as political science, which seeks the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, to the lower acts and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which seek some special <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as appears from what was said above (Question 37, Article 1). Now political science, as stated in Ethic. i, 2, lays down the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to lower <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, namely what science each one ought to cultivate, and how far he should pursue it and in what way. Wherefore it belongs to a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to assign others to places in all the Divine services. Hence he alone confirms, because those who are confirmed receive the office, as it were, of confessing the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; again he alone blesses <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> who are images of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> spouse, the care of which is entrusted chiefly to him; and he it is who consecrates the candidates for ordination to the ministry of Orders, and, by his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, appoints the vessels that they are to use; even as secular offices in various cities are allotted by him who holds the highest power, for instance by the king.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (Question 37, Article 5), at the imposition of hands there is given, not the character of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> Order, but <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which makes a man fit to exercise his Order. And since those who are raised to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> need most copious <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> together with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> lay hands on them, but the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> alone lays hands on <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Since the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> is as it were minister-in-chief, all things pertaining to the ministry are handed by him, for instance the candle with which the <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolyte</a> serves the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> by carrying it before him at the Gospel, and the <a href="../cathen/04543a.htm">cruet</a> with which he serves the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>; and in like manner he gives the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> the things with which the latter serves the higher Orders. And yet the principal act of the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> does not consist in these things, but in his co-operation as regards the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the sacrament; wherefore he receives the character through the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> being handed to him by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. On the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolyte</a> receives the character by virtue of the words of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> when the aforesaid things--the <a href="../cathen/04543a.htm">cruet</a> rather than the <a href="../cathen/03248a.htm">candlestick</a>--are handed to him by the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>. Hence it does not follow that the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> ordains.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, who has the fulness of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> power, can entrust one who is not a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> with things pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> dignity, provided they bear no immediate relation to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Hence by virtue of his commission a simple <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> can confer the <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor Orders</a> and confirm; but not one who is not a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Nor can a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> confer the higher Orders which bear an immediate relation to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, over the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of which the Pope's power is no greater than that of a simple <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is in itself the greatest of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, it does not place a man in an office as does the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacrament of Order</a>. Hence the comparison fails.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> In order to bestow what one has on another, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> not only to be near him but also to have fulness of power. And since a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> has not fulness of power in the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchical</a> offices, as a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has, it does not follow that he can raise others to the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a>, although the latter Order is near to his.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether heretics and those who are cut off from the Church can confer Orders? [Cf. III, 64, 5,9]</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and those who are cut off from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> cannot confer Orders. For to confer Orders is a greater thing than to loose or bind anyone. But a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> cannot loose or bind. Neither therefore can he ordain.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> that is separated from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> can <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a>, because the character whence he derives this power remains in him indelibly. But a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> receives no character when he is raised to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopate</a>. Therefore he does not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> retain the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> power after his separation from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in no community can one who is expelled therefrom dispose of the offices of the community. Now Orders are offices of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Therefore one who is outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> cannot confer Orders.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> derive their efficacy from <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's passion</a>. Now a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> is not united to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> passion; neither by his own <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, since he is an unbeliever, nor by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, since he is severed from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Therefore he cannot confer the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacrament of Orders</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in the conferring of Orders. But a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a>; in fact his <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> is turned into a curse, as appears from the authorities quoted in the text (Sent. iv, D, 25). Therefore he cannot ordain.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> When a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who has fallen into <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is reconciled he is not reconsecrated. Therefore he did not lose the power which he had of conferring Orders.

<p>Further, the power to ordain is greater than the power of Orders. But the power of Orders is not forfeited on account of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and the like. Neither therefore is the power to ordain.

<p>Further, as the one who baptizes exercises a merely outward ministry, so does one who ordains, while <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> works inwardly. But one who is cut off from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by no means loses the power to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>. Neither therefore does he lose the power to ordain.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> on this question four opinions are mentioned in the text (Sent. iv, D, 25). For some said that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, so long as they are tolerated by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, retain the power to ordain, but not after they have been cut off from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; as neither do those who have been degraded and the like. This is the first opinion. Yet this is impossible, because, happen what may, no power that is given with a <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> can be taken away so long as the thing itself remains, any more than the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> itself can be annulled, for even an altar or chrism once <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> remains <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> for ever. Wherefore, since the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> power is conferred by <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, it must needs endure for ever, however much a man may <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> or be cut off from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For this reason others said that those who are cut off from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> after having <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> power in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, retain the power to ordain and raise others, but that those who are raised by them have not this power. This is the fourth opinion. But this again is impossible, for if those who were ordained in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> retain the power they received, it is clear that by exercising their power they <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> validly, and therefore they validly confer whatever power is given with that <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, and thus those who receive ordination or promotion from them have the same power as they. Wherefore others said that even those who are cut off from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> can confer Orders and the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, provided they observe the due form and <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, both as to the first effect, which is the conferring of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, and as to the ultimate effect which is the conferring of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. This is the second opinion. But this again is inadmissible, since by the very fact that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> communicates in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> with a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> who is cut off from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and thus approaches the sacrament insincerely and cannot obtain <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, except perhaps in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> in a case of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. Hence others say that they confer the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> validly, but do not confer <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> with them, not that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are lacking in efficacy, but on account of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of those who receive the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> from such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> despite the prohibition of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. This is the third and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> opinion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The effect of <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> is nothing else but the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which results from <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and consequently a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a>, as neither can he confer <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Moreover in order to give <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to have <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, which one who is cut off from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has not.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When a man is raised to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopate</a> he receives a power which he retains for ever. This, however, cannot be called a character, because a man is not thereby placed in direct relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but to <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">Christ's mystical body</a>. Nevertheless it remains indelibly even as the character, because it is given by <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Those who are ordained by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, although they receive an Order, do not receive the exercise thereof, so as to minister lawfully in their Orders, for the very reason indicated in the Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> They are united to the passion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, for although in themselves they are severed from it, they are united to it as regards the form of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which they observe.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> This refers to the ultimate effect of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, as the third opinion maintains.
