<h1>Question 39. Schism</h1>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether schism is a special sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For "<a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>," as <a href="../cathen/11602a.htm">Pope Pelagius I</a> says (Epist. ad Victor. et Pancrat.), "denotes a division." But every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a division, according to <a href="../bible/isa059.htm">Isaiah 59</a>: "Your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> have divided between you and your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a man is apparently a schismatic if he disobeys the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> makes a man disobey the commandments of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, because <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> (De Parad. viii) "is disobedience against the heavenly commandments." Therefore every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> also divides a man from the unity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. If, therefore, the word <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> denotes a division, it would seem not to differ, as a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of unbelief.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Contra Faust. xx, 3; Contra Crescon. ii, 4) distinguishes between <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, for he says that a "schismatic is one who holds the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and practises the same worship, as others, and takes pleasure in the mere disunion of the community, whereas a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> is one who holds another <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> from that of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Church." Therefore <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> is not a generic <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. viii, 3), <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> takes its name "from being a scission of minds," and scission is opposed to unity. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> is one that is directly and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> opposed to unity. For in the moral, as in the physical order, the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is not constituted by that which is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>. Now, in the moral order, the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> is that which is intended, and that which results beside the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, is, as it were, <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> is, properly speaking, a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for the reason that the schismatic intends to sever himself from that unity which is the effect of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: because <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> unites not only one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to another with the bond of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> love, but also the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in unity of spirit.

<p>Accordingly schismatics properly so called are those who, wilfully and intentionally separate themselves from the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; for this is the chief unity, and the particular unity of several <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> among themselves is subordinate to the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, even as the mutual adaptation of each member of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> body is subordinate to the unity of the whole body. Now the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> consists in two things; namely, in the mutual connection or communion of the members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and again in the subordination of all the members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to the one head, according to <a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse18">Colossians 2:18-19</a>: "Puffed up by the sense of his flesh, and not holding the Head, from which the whole body, by joints and bands, being supplied with nourishment and compacted, groweth unto the increase of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Now this Head is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself, Whose viceregent in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Sovereign Pontiff</a>. Wherefore schismatics are those who refuse to submit to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Sovereign Pontiff</a>, and to hold communion with those members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> who acknowledge his supremacy.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The division between <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that results from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not intended by the sinner: it happens beside his <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> as a result of his turning inordinately to a mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and so it is not <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> properly so called.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> consists in rebelliously disobeying the commandments: and I say "rebelliously," since a schismatic both obstinately scorns the commandments of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and refuses to submit to her judgment. But every sinner does not do this, wherefore not every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Heresy and <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> are distinguished in respect of those things to which each is opposed <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> and directly. For <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> opposed to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, while <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> opposed to the unity of ecclesiastical <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Wherefore just as <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> are different <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, although whoever lacks <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> lacks <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, so too <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> are different <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, although whoever is a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> is also a schismatic, but not conversely. This is what <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says in his commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians [In Ep. ad Tit. iii, 10]: "I consider the difference between <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> to be that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> holds <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> doctrine while <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> severs a man from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>." Nevertheless, just as the loss of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is the road to the loss of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse6">1 Timothy 1:6</a>: "From which things," i.e. <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and the like, "some going astray, are turned aside into vain babbling," so too, <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> is the road to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> adds (In Ep. ad Tit. iii, 10) that "at the outset it is possible, in a certain respect, to find a difference between <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>: yet there is no <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> that does not devise some <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> for itself, that it may appear to have had a reason for separating from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether schism is a graver sin than unbelief?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> is a graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than unbelief. For the graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> meets with a graver punishment, according to <a href="../bible/deu025.htm#verse2">Deuteronomy 25:2</a>: "According to the measure of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> shall the measure also of the stripes be." Now we find the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> punished more severely than even the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of unbelief or <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>: for we read (<a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse28">Exodus 32:28</a>) that some were slain by the swords of their fellow men on account of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>: whereas of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> we read (<a href="../bible/num016.htm#verse30">Numbers 16:30</a>): "If the Lord do a new thing, and the earth opening her mouth swallow them down, and all things that belong to them, and they go down alive into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they have blasphemed the Lord <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Moreover the ten tribes who were guilty of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> in revolting from the rule of David were most severely punished (<a href="../bible/2ki017.htm">2 Kings 17</a>). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> is graver than the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of unbelief.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the multitude is greater and more godlike than the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. i, 2). Now <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> is opposed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the multitude, namely, <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">ecclesiastical unity</a>, whereas unbelief is contrary to the particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, namely the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> is a graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than unbelief.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is opposed to a greater <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. viii, 10). Now <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> is opposed to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which is a greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to which unbelief is opposed, as shown above (10, 2; 23, 6). Therefore <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> is a graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than unbelief.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> That which results from an addition to something else surpasses that thing either in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> results from something being added to <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, for it adds corrupt doctrine, as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> declares in the passage quoted above (1, ad 3). Therefore <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> is a less grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than unbelief.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The gravity of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be considered in two ways: first, according to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, secondly, according to its circumstances. And since particular circumstances are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in number, so too they can be varied in an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of ways: wherefore if one were to ask in general which of two <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is the graver, the question must be understood to refer to the gravity derived from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin's</a> genus. Now the genus or <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is taken from its object, as shown above (I-II, 72, 1; I-II, 73, 3). Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is opposed to the greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is, in respect of its genus, more grievous, for instance a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is graver than a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed against one's neighbor.

<p>Now it is evident that unbelief is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, according as He is Himself the First Truth, on which <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is founded; whereas <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> is opposed to <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">ecclesiastical unity</a>, which is a participated <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and a lesser <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself. Wherefore it is manifest that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of unbelief is generically more grievous than the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, although it may happen that a particular schismatic <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> more grievously than a particular unbeliever, either because his contempt is greater, or because his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a source of greater danger, or for some similar reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It had already been declared to that people by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> which they had received that there was one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that no other <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was to be worshipped by them; and the same had been confirmed among them by many kinds of signs. Consequently there was no need for those who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by falling into <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, to be punished in an unwonted manner: it was enough that they should be punished in the usual way. On the other hand, it was not so well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> among them that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was always to be their ruler, and so it behooved those who rebelled against his authority to be punished in a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> and unwonted manner.

<p>We may also reply by saying that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> was sometimes more severely punished in that people, because they were inclined to seditions and schisms. For it is written (<a href="../bible/ezr004.htm#verse15">Ezra 4:15</a>): "This city since days gone by has rebelled against its kings: and seditions and <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> were raised therein [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'This city is a rebellious city, and hurtful to the kings and provinces, and . . . <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> were raised therein of old']." Now sometimes a more severe punishment is inflicted for an <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (as stated above, I-II, 105, 2, ad 9), because punishments are medicines intended to keep <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> away from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: so that where there is greater proneness to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, a more severe punishment ought to be inflicted. As regards the ten tribes, they were punished not only for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, but also for that of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> as stated in the passage quoted.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the multitude is greater than the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of a unit in that multitude, so is it less than the extrinsic <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to which that multitude is directed, even as the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of a rank in the army is less than the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the commander-in-chief. On like manner the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">ecclesiastical unity</a>, to which <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> is opposed, is less than the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, to which unbelief is opposed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> has two objects; one is its principal object and is the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, the other is its secondary object and is our neighbor's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> and other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against our neighbor, are opposed to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> in respect of its secondary <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is less than the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, for this is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself; and so these <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are less grievous than unbelief. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is opposed to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> in respect of its principal object, is not less grievous than unbelief. Nevertheless of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> against his neighbor, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> would seem to be the greatest, because it is opposed to the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the multitude.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether schismatics have any power?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that schismatics have some power. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Donat. i, 1): "Just as those who come back to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> after being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, are not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again, so those who return after being ordained, are not ordained again." Now Order is a kind of power. Therefore schismatics have some power since they retain their Orders.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Unico Bapt. [De Bap. contra Donat. vi, 5): "One who is separated can confer a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> even as he can have it." But the power of conferring a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is a very great power. Therefore schismatics who are separated from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, have a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, Pope Urban II [Council of Piacenza, cap. x; cf. Can. Ordinationes, ix, qu. 1 says: "We command that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who were themselves <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> according to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> rite, but have separated themselves by <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> from the Roman Church, should be received mercifully and that their Orders should be acknowledged, when they return to the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, provided they be of commendable life and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>." But this would not be so, unless <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power were retained by schismatics. Therefore schismatics have <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> says in a letter (Ep. lii, quoted vii, qu. 1, can. Novatianus): "He who observes neither unity of spirit nor the concord of peace, and severs himself from the bonds of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and from the fellowship of her <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, cannot have <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> power or <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Spiritual power is twofold, the one sacramental, the other a power of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. The sacramental power is one that is conferred by some kind of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. Now all the consecrations of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are immovable so long as the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> thing remains: as appears even in inanimate things, since an altar, once <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, is not <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> again unless it has been broken up. Consequently such a power as this remains, as to its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who has received it by <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, as long as he lives, even if he fall into <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> or <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>: and this is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> from the fact that if he come back to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he is not <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> anew. Since, however, the lower power ought not to exercise its act, except in so far as it is moved by the higher power, as may be seen also in the physical order, it follows that such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> lose the use of their power, so that it is not lawful for them to use it. Yet if they use it, this power has its effect in sacramental acts, because therein <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> acts only as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> instrument, so that sacramental effects are not precluded on account of any fault whatever in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who confers the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p>On the other hand, the power of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> is that which is conferred by a mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> appointment. Such a power as this does not adhere to the recipient immovably: so that it does not remain in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and schismatics; and consequently they neither <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> nor <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a>, nor grant <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>, nor do anything of the kind, and if they do, it is invalid.

<p>Accordingly when it is said that such like <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> have no <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power, it is to be understood as referring either to the second power, or if it be referred to the first power, not as referring to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the power, but to its lawful use.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether it is right that schismatics should be punished with excommunication?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that schismatics are not rightly punished with <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. For <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> deprives a man chiefly of a share in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. But <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Donat. vi, 5) that "<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> can be received from a schismatic." Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> is not a fitting punishment for schismatics.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> faithful to lead back those who have gone astray, wherefore it is written against certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> (<a href="../bible/eze034.htm#verse4">Ezekiel 34:4</a>): "That which was driven away you have not brought again, neither have you sought that which was lost." Now schismatics are more easily brought back by such as may hold communion with them. Therefore it seems that they ought not to be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a double punishment is not inflicted for one and the same <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/nah001.htm#verse9">Nahum 1:9</a>: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will not judge the same twice" [<a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint version</a>]. Now some receive a temporal punishment for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, according to23, 5, where it is stated: "Both divine and earthly laws have laid down that those who are severed from the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and disturb her peace, must be punished by the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a>." Therefore they ought not to be punished with <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/num016.htm#verse26">Numbers 16:26</a>): "Depart from the tents of these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men," those, to wit, who had <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, "and touch nothing of theirs, lest you be involved in their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to <a href="../bible/wis011.htm#verse11">Wisdom 11:11</a>, "By what things a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinneth</a>, by the same also he should be punished" [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'he is tormented']. Now a schismatic, as shown above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), commits a twofold <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: first by separating himself from communion with the members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and in this respect the fitting punishment for schismatics is that they be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. Secondly, they refuse submission to the head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, wherefore, since they are unwilling to be controlled by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power, it is just that they should be compelled by the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is not lawful to receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> from a schismatic, save in a case of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, since it is better for a man to quit this life, marked with the sign of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, no <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> from whom he may receive it, whether from a <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jew</a> or a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a>, than deprived of that mark, which is bestowed in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Excommunication does not forbid the intercourse whereby a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> by salutary admonitions leads back to the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> those who are separated from her. Ondeed this very separation brings them back somewhat, because through confusion at their separation, they are sometimes led to do penance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The punishments of the present life are medicinal, and therefore when one punishment does not suffice to compel a man, another is added: just as physicians employ several body medicines when one has no effect. On like manner the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, when <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> does not sufficiently restrain certain men, employs the compulsion of the secular arm. If, however, one punishment suffices, another should not be employed.
