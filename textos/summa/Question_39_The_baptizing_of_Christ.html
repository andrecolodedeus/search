<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether it was fitting that Christ should be baptized?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it was not fitting for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. For to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> is to be washed. But it was not fitting for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be washed, since there was no <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> in Him. Therefore it seems unfitting for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> in order to fulfil the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. But <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was not prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Therefore He should not have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the first mover in every genus is unmoved in regard to that movement; thus the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, which is the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of alteration, is unalterable. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the first principle of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse33">John 1:33</a>: "He upon whom thou shalt see the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> descending and remaining upon Him, He it is that baptizeth." Therefore it was unfitting for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse13">Matthew 3:13</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> cometh from <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> to the Jordan, unto John, to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by him."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It was fitting for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. First, because, as <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says on <a href="../bible/luk003.htm#verse21">Luke 3:21</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> because He wished, not to be cleansed, but to cleanse the waters, that, being purified by the flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, they might have the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>"; and, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. iv in Matth.), "that He might bequeath the sanctified waters to those who were to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> afterwards." Secondly, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. iv in Matth.), "although <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not a sinner, yet did He take a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and 'the likeness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> flesh.' Wherefore, though He needed not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> for His own sake, yet carnal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in others had need thereof." And, as <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory Nazianzen</a> says (Orat. xxxix) "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> that He might plunge the old <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> entirely in the water." Thirdly, He wished to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a sermon on the Epiphany (cxxxvi), "because He wished to do what He had commanded all to do." And this is what He means by saying: "So it becometh us to fulfil all <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>" (<a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse15">Matthew 3:15</a>). For, as <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (on <a href="../bible/luk003.htm#verse21">Luke 3:21</a>), "this is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, to do first thyself that which thou wishest another to do, and so encourage others by thy example."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, not that He might be cleansed, but that He might cleanse, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It was fitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should not only fulfil what was prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, but also begin what appertained to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>. Therefore He wished not only to be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, but also to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the first principle of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism's</a> <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> effect. Unto this He was not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, but only in water.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether it was fitting for Christ to be baptized with John's baptism?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it was unfitting for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. For John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was the "<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of penance." But penance is unbecoming to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, since He had no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore it seems that He should not have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. de Bapt. Christi), "was a mean between the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> and that of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." But "the mean savors of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the extremes" (<a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, De Partib. Animal.). Since, therefore, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the Jewish <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, nor yet with His own, on the same grounds He should not have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whatever is best in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> things should be ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> does not hold the first place among baptisms. Therefore it was not fitting for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse13">Matthew 3:13</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> cometh to the Jordan, unto John, to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by him."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Super Joan., Tract. xiii): "After being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, the Lord <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, not with that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> wherewith He was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>." Wherefore, since He Himself <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with His own <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, it follows that He was not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with His own, but with John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. And this was befitting: first, because John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was peculiar in this, that he <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, not in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, but only "in water"; while <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not need <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, since He was filled with the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> from the beginning of His conception, as we have made clear above (Question 34, Article 1). And this is the reason given by <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> (Hom. de Bapt. Christi). Secondly, as <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> says on <a href="../bible/mar001.htm#verse9">Mark 1:9</a>, He was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John, that, "by being thus <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, He might show His approval of John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>." Thirdly, as <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory Nazianzen</a> says (Orat. xxxix), "by going to John to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by him, He sanctified <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> wished to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in order by His example to lead us to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. And so, in order that He might lead us thereto more efficaciously, He wished to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which He clearly needed not, that men who needed it might approach unto it. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says on <a href="../bible/luk003.htm#verse21">Luke 3:21</a>: "Let none decline the laver of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not refuse the laver of penance."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The Jewish <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was merely figurative, whereas John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, in a measure, was real, inasmuch as it induced men to refrain from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but Christ's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is efficacious unto the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and the conferring of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> needed neither the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which was not in Him, nor the bestowal of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, with which He was filled. Moreover, since He is "the Truth," it was not fitting that He should receive that which was no more than a figure. Consequently it was more fitting that He should receive the intermediate <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> than one of the extremes.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> remedy. Now, the more perfect a thing is, the less remedy does it need. Consequently, from the very fact that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is most perfect, it follows that it was fitting that He should not receive the most perfect <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>: just as one who is healthy does not need a strong medicine.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether Christ was baptized at a fitting time?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> at an unfitting time. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in order that He might lead others to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> by His example. But it is commendable that the faithful of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, not merely before their thirtieth year, but even in infancy. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should not have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> at the age of thirty.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, we do not read that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> taught or worked <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> before being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. But it would have been more profitable to the world if He had taught for a longer time, beginning at the age of twenty, or even before. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who came for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> profit, should have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> before His thirtieth year.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the sign of wisdom infused by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should have been especially manifest in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But in the case of <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">Daniel</a> this was manifested at the time of his boyhood; according to <a href="../bible/dan013.htm#verse45">Daniel 13:45</a>: "The Lord raised up the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> spirit of a young boy, whose name was <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">Daniel</a>." Much more, therefore, should <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> or have taught in His boyhood.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was ordered to that of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as to its end. But "the end is first in <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> and last in execution." Therefore He should have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by John either before all the others, or after them.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/luk003.htm#verse21">Luke 3:21</a>): "It came to pass, when all the people were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> also being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>;" and further on (<a href="../bible/luk003.htm#verse23">Luke 3:23</a>): "And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> Himself was beginning about the age of thirty years."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was fittingly <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in His thirtieth year. First, because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> as though for the reason that He was about forthwith to begin to teach and preach: for which purpose perfect age is required, such as is the age of thirty. Thus we read (<a href="../bible/gen041.htm#verse46">Genesis 41:46</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> was thirty" years old when he undertook the government of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. In like manner we read (<a href="../bible/2sa005.htm#verse4">2 Samuel 5:4</a>) that "David was thirty years old when he began to reign." Again, <a href="../cathen/05737b.htm">Ezechiel</a> began to prophesy in "his thirtieth year," as we read <a href="../bible/eze001.htm#verse1">Ezekiel 1:1</a>.

<p>Secondly, because, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. x in Matth.), "the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was about to pass away after Christ's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>: wherefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> came to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> at this age which admits of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; in order that by His observing the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, no one might say that because He Himself could not fulfil it, He did away with it."

<p>Thirdly, because by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> at the perfect age, we are given to understand that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> brings forth perfect men, according to <a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse13">Ephesians 4:13</a>: "Until we all meet into the unity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, unto a perfect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, unto the measure of the age of the fulness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." Hence the very property of the number seems to point to this. For thirty is product of three and ten: and by the number three is implied <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, while ten signifies the fulfilment of the commandments of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>: in which two things the perfection of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life consists.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory Nazianzen</a> says (Orat. xl), <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, not "as though He needed to be cleansed, or as though some peril threatened Him if He delayed to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. But no small danger besets any other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who departs from this life without being clothed with the garment of incorruptibility"--namely, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. And though it be a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thing to remain clean after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, "yet is it still better," as he says, "to be slightly sullied now and then than to be altogether deprived of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The profit which accrues to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is chiefly through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>: to both of which He conduced by beginning to teach not in His boyhood or youth, but at the perfect age. To <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, because in this manner His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is shown to be real, by its making bodily progress with the advance of time; and lest this progress should be deemed <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a>, He did not wish to show His wisdom and power before His body had reached the perfect age: to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, lest anyone should presume to govern or teach others before attaining to perfect age.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was set before men as an example to all. Wherefore it behooved that to be shown forth in Him, which is becoming to all according to the common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>--namely, that He should teach after reaching the perfect age. But, as <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory Nazianzen</a> says (Orat. xxxix), that which seldom occurs is not the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; as "neither does one swallow make the spring." For by special dispensation, in accordance with the ruling of Divine wisdom, it has been granted to some, contrary to the common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, to exercise the functions of governing or teaching, such as Solomon, <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">Daniel</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremias</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> It was not fitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by John either before or after all others. Because, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. iv in Matth. [From the supposititious Opus Imperfectum), for this was <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, "that He might confirm the preaching and the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John, and that John might bear witness to Him." Now, men would not have had <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in John's testimony except after many had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by him. Consequently it was not fitting that John should <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> Him before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> anyone else. In like manner, neither was it fitting that he should <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> Him last. For as he (Chrysostom) says in the same passage: "As the light of the sun does not wait for the setting of the morning star, but comes forth while the latter is still above the horizon, and by its brilliance dims its shining: so <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not wait till John had run his course, but appeared while he was yet teaching and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>."

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether Christ should have been baptized in the Jordan?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should not have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the Jordan. For the reality should correspond to the figure. But <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was prefigured in the crossing of the Red Sea, where the Egyptians were drowned, just as our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are blotted out in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should rather have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the sea than in the river Jordan.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "Jordan" is interpreted a "going down." But by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> a man goes up rather than down: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse16">Matthew 3:16</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, forthwith came up [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'out'] from the water." Therefore it seems unfitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the Jordan.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, while the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> were crossing, the waters of the Jordan "were turned back," as it is related <a href="../bible/jos004.htm">Joshua 4</a>, and as it is written <a href="../bible/psa113.htm#verse3">Psalm 113:3-5</a>. But those who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> go forward, not back. Therefore it was not fitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the Jordan.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mar001.htm#verse9">Mark 1:9</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by John in the Jordan."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It was through the river Jordan that the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> entered into the land of promise. Now, this is the prerogative of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> over all other baptisms: that it is the entrance to the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, which is signified by the land of promise; wherefore it is said (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse5">John 3:5</a>): "Unless a man be born again of water and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, he cannot enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>." To this also is to be referred the dividing of the water of the Jordan by Elias, who was to be snatched up into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> in a fiery chariot, as it is related <a href="../bible/2ki002.htm">2 Kings 2</a>: because, to wit, the approach to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is laid open by the fire of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, to those who pass through the waters of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Therefore it was fitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the Jordan.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The crossing of the Red Sea foreshadowed <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in this--that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> washes away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: whereas the crossing of the Jordan foreshadows it in this--that it opens the gate to the heavenly kingdom: and this is the principal effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and accomplished through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> alone. And therefore it was fitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the Jordan rather than in the sea.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> we "go up" by advancing in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: for which we need to "go down" by <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, according to <a href="../bible/jam004.htm#verse6">James 4:6</a>: "He giveth <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>." And to this "going down" must the name of the Jordan be referred.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a sermon for the Epiphany (x): "As of yore the waters of the Jordan were held back, so now, when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, the torrent of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was held back." Or else this may signify that against the downward flow of the waters the river of blessings flowed upwards.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the heavens should have been opened unto Christ at His baptism?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the heavens should not have been opened unto <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> at His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. For the heavens should be opened unto one who needs to enter <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, by reason of his being out of heaven. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was always in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse13">John 3:13</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> who is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>." Therefore it seems that the heavens should not have been opened unto Him.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the opening of the heavens is understood either in a corporal or in a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> sense. But it cannot be understood in a corporal sense: because the heavenly bodies are impassible and indissoluble, according to <a href="../bible/job037.htm#verse18">Job 37:18</a>: "Thou perhaps hast made the heavens with Him, which are most strong, as if they were of molten brass." In like manner neither can it be understood in a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> sense, because the heavens were not previously closed to the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Therefore it seems unbecoming to say that when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> "the heavens were opened."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> was opened to the faithful through <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, according to <a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse19">Hebrews 10:19</a>: "We have [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Having'] a confidence in the entering into the holies by the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." Wherefore not even those who were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and died before His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, could enter <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Therefore the heavens should have been opened when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was suffering rather than when He was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/luk003.htm#verse21">Luke 3:21</a>): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> was opened."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1; 38, 1), <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> wished to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in order to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> wherewith we were to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. And therefore it behooved those things to be shown forth which belong to the efficacy of our <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>: concerning which efficacy three points are to be considered. First, the principal power from which it is derived; and this, indeed, is a heavenly power. For which reason, when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> was opened, to show that in future the heavenly power would sanctify <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.

<p>Secondly, the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> conduces to the efficacy of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>: wherefore those who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> make a profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is called the "sacrament of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>." Now by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> we gaze on heavenly things, which surpass the senses and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. And in order to signify this, the heavens were opened when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.

<p>Thirdly, because the entrance to the heavenly kingdom was opened to us by the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in a special manner, which entrance had been closed to the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Hence, when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, the heavens were opened, to show that the way to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is open to the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.

<p>Now after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> continually, in order to enter <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: for though <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are remitted through <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, there still remain the fomes of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> assailing us from within, and the world and the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">devils</a> assailing us from without. And therefore it is said pointedly (<a href="../bible/luk003.htm#verse21">Luke 3:21</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> was opened": because, to wit, the faithful after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> stand in need of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Or else, that we may be led to understand that the very fact that through <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is opened to believers is in virtue of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Hence it is said pointedly (<a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse16">Matthew 3:16</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> was opened to Him"--that is, "to all for His sake." Thus, for example, the Emperor might say to one asking a favor for another: "Behold, I grant this favor, not to him, but to thee"--that is, "to him for thy sake," as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. iv in Matth. [From the supposititious Opus Imperfectum).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> (Hom. iv in Matth.; from the supposititious Opus Imperfectum), as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> sake, though He needed no <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> for His own sake, so the heavens were opened unto Him as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, whereas in respect of His Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> He was ever in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on <a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse16">Matthew 3:16-17</a>, the heavens were opened to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> when He was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, not by an unfolding of the elements, but by a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> vision: thus does <a href="../cathen/05737b.htm">Ezechiel</a> relate the opening of the heavens at the beginning of his book. And <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> proves this (Hom. iv in Matth.; from the supposititious Opus Imperfectum) by saying that "if the creature"--namely, <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>--"had been sundered he would not have said, 'were opened to Him,' since what is opened in a corporeal sense is open to all." Hence it is said expressly (<a href="../bible/mar001.htm#verse10">Mark 1:10</a>) that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> "forthwith coming up out of the water, saw the heavens opened"; as though the opening of the heavens were to be considered as seen by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Some, indeed, refer this to the corporeal vision, and say that such a brilliant light shone round about <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> when He was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, that the heavens seemed to be opened. It can also be referred to the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision, in which manner <a href="../cathen/05737b.htm">Ezechiel</a> saw the heavens opened: since such a vision was formed in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> by the Divine power and by His rational will, so as to signify that the entrance to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is opened to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> through baptism. Lastly, it can be referred to <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> vision: forasmuch as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, when He had sanctified <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, saw that <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> was opened to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: nevertheless He had seen before that this would be accomplished.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> is the common <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the opening of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. But it behooves this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to be applied to each one, in order that he enter <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. And this is effected by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse3">Romans 6:3</a>: "All we who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a> are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in His death." Wherefore mention is made of the opening of the heavens at His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> rather than at His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>.

<p>Or, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. iv in Matth.; from the supposititious Opus Imperfectum): "When <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, the heavens were merely opened: but after He had vanquished the tyrant by the cross; since gates were no longer needed for a <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> which thenceforth would be never closed, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> said, not 'open the gates,' but 'Take them away.'" Thus <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> gives us to understand that the obstacles which had hitherto hindered the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the departed from entering into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> were entirely removed by the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>: but at Christ's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> they were opened, as though the way had been shown by which men were to enter into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether it is fitting to say that when Christ was baptized the Holy Ghost came down on Him in the form of a dove?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is not fitting to say that when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> came down on Him in the form of a dove. For the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> dwells in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But the fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was in the Man-Christ from the beginning of His conception, because He was the "Only-begotten of the Father," as is clear from what has been said above (7, 12; 34, 1). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> should not have been sent to Him at His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is said to have "descended" into the world in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, when "He emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant" (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse7">Philippians 2:7</a>). But the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> did not become <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>. Therefore it is unbecoming to say that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> "descended upon Him."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that which is accomplished in our <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> should have been shown in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, as in an exemplar. But in our <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> no visible mission of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> takes place. Therefore neither should a visible mission of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> have taken place in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is poured forth on others through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse16">John 1:16</a>: "Of His fulness we all have received." But the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> came down on the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> in the form, not of a dove, but of fire. Therefore neither should He have come down on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in the form of a dove, but in the form of fire.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/luk003.htm#verse22">Luke 3:22</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> descended in a bodily shape as a dove upon Him."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> What took place with respect to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. iv in Matth. [From the supposititious Opus Imperfectum), "is connected with the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> accomplished in all who were to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> afterwards." Now, all those who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, unless they approach unworthily; according to <a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse11">Matthew 3:11</a>: "He shall <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> you in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." Therefore it was fitting that when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> should descend upon Him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xv): "It is most absurd to say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, when He was already thirty years old: for when He came to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, since He was without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, therefore was He not without the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. For if it is written of John that 'he shall be filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> from his mother's womb,' what must we say of the Man-Christ, whose conception in the flesh was not carnal, but <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>? Therefore now," i.e. at His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, "He deigned to foreshadow His body," i.e. the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, "in which those who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> in a special manner."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. ii), the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is said to have descended on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in a bodily shape, as a dove, not because the very <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was seen, for He is invisible: nor as though that visible creature were assumed into the unity of the Divine Person; since it is not said that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was the dove, as it is said that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by reason of the union. Nor, again, was the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> seen under the form of a dove, after the manner in which John saw the slain Lamb in the Apocalypse (<a href="../bible/rev005.htm#verse6">5:6</a>): "For the latter vision took place in the spirit through <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> images of bodies; whereas no one ever <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> that this dove was seen by the eyes of the body." Nor, again, did the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> appear under the form of a dove in the sense in which it is said (<a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse4">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>): "'Now, the rock was Christ': for the latter had already a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and through the manner of its action was called by the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, whom it signified: whereas this dove came suddenly into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, to fulfil the purpose of its signification, and afterwards ceased to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, like the flame which appeared in the bush to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>."

<p>Hence the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is said to have descended upon <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, not by reason of His being united to the dove: but either because the dove itself signified the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, inasmuch as it "descended" when it came upon Him; or, again, by reason of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which is poured out by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so as to descend, as it were, on the creature, according to <a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse17">James 1:17</a>: "Every best <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> and every perfect <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> is from above, coming down from the Father of lights."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. xii in Matth.): "At the beginning of all <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> transactions sensible <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">visions</a> appear, for the sake of them who cannot conceive at all an incorporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> . . . so that, though afterwards no such thing occur, they may shape their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> according to that which has occurred once for all." And therefore the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> descended visibly, under a bodily shape, on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> at His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, in order that we may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him to descend invisibly on all those who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> appeared over <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> at His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, under the form of a dove, for four reasons. First, on account of the disposition required in the one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>--namely, that he approach in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: since! as it is written (<a href="../bible/wis001.htm#verse5">Wisdom 1:5</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> spirit of discipline will flee from the deceitful." For the dove is an animal of a simple character, void of cunning and deceit: whence it is said (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse16">Matthew 10:16</a>): "Be ye simple as doves."

<p>Secondly, in order to designate the seven <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, which are signified by the properties of the dove. For the dove dwells beside the running stream, in order that, on perceiving the hawk, it may plunge in and escape. This refers to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of wisdom, whereby the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> dwell beside the running waters of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Scripture</a>, in order to escape the assaults of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Again, the dove prefers the more choice seeds. This refers to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, whereby the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> make choice of sound doctrines, with which they nourish themselves. Further, the dove feeds the brood of other birds. This refers to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of counsel, with which the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, by teaching and example, feed men who have been the brood, i.e. imitators, of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Again, the dove tears not with its beak. This refers to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding, wherewith the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> do not rend sound doctrines, as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> do. Again, the dove has no gall. This refers to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of piety, by reason of which the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are free from unreasonable <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. Again, the dove builds its nest in the cleft of a rock. This refers to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, wherewith the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> build their nest, i.e. take refuge and hope, in the death wounds of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who is the Rock of strength. Lastly, the dove has a plaintive song. This refers to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of fear, wherewith the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> delight in bewailing <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p>Thirdly, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> appeared under the form of a dove on account of the proper effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which is the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and reconciliation with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: for the dove is a gentle creature. Wherefore, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says, (Hom. xii in Matth.), "at the <a href="../cathen/04702a.htm">Deluge</a> this creature appeared bearing an olive branch, and publishing the tidings of the universal peace of the whole world: and now again the dove appears at the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, pointing to our Deliverer."

<p>Fourthly, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> appeared over <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> at His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in the form of a dove, in order to designate the common effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>--namely, the building up of the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse25">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> delivered Himself up . . . that He might present . . . to Himself a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing . . . cleansing it by the laver of water in the word of life." Therefore it was fitting that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> should appear at the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> under the form of a dove, which is a creature both <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> and gregarious. Wherefore also it is said of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (<a href="../bible/son006.htm#verse8">Canticles 6:8</a>): "One is my dove."

<p>But on the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> descended under the form of fire, for two reasons. First, to show with what fervor their hearts were to be moved, so as to preach <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> everywhere, though surrounded by opposition. And therefore He appeared as a fiery tongue. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Super Joan., Tract. vi): <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> "manifests" the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> "visibly in two ways"--namely, "by the dove corning upon the Lord when He was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; by fire, coming upon the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> when they were met together . . . In the former case simplicity is shown, in the latter fervor . . . We learn, then, from the dove, that those who are sanctified by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> should be without guile: and from the fire, that their simplicity should not be left to wax cold. Nor let it disturb anyone that the tongues were cloven . . . in the dove recognize unity."

<p>Secondly, because, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (<a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, Hom. xxx in Ev.): "Since <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> had to be forgiven," which is effected in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, "meekness was required"; this is shown by the dove: "but when we have obtained <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> we must look forward to be judged"; and this is signified by the fire.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the dove in which the Holy Ghost appeared was real?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the dove in which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> appeared was not real. For that seems to be a mere apparition which appears in its semblance. But it is stated (<a href="../bible/luk003.htm#verse22">Luke 3:22</a>) that the "<a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> descended in a bodily shape as a dove upon Him." Therefore it was not a real dove, but a semblance of a dove.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as "Nature does nothing useless, so neither does <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (De Coelo i). Now since this dove came merely "in order to signify something and pass away," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. ii), a real dove would have been useless: because the semblance of a dove was sufficient for that purpose. Therefore it was not a real dove.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the properties of a thing lead us to a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of that thing. If, therefore, this were a real dove, its properties would have signified the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the real animal, and not the effect of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Therefore it seems that it was not a real dove.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Agone Christ. xxii): "Nor do we say this as though we asserted that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> alone had a real body, and that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> appeared to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> eyes in a fallacious manner: but we say that both those bodies were real."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 5, Article 1), it was unbecoming that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who is the Truth of the Father, should make use of anything unreal; wherefore He took, not an <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a>, but a real body. And since the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is called the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of Truth, as appears from <a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse13">John 16:13</a>, therefore He too made a real dove in which to appear, though He did not assume it into unity of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Wherefore, after the words quoted above, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> adds: "Just as it behooved the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> not to deceive men, so it behooved the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> not to deceive. But it was easy for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a>, who <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> all creatures out of nothing, to frame the body of a real dove without the help of other doves, just as it was easy for Him to form a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body in Mary's womb without the seed of a man: since the corporeal creature obeys its Lord's command and will, both in the mother's womb in forming a man, and in the world itself in forming a dove."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is said to have descended in the shape or semblance of a dove, not in the sense that the dove was not real, but in order to show that He did not appear in the form of His <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It was not superfluous to form a real dove, in which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> might appear, because by the very reality of the dove the reality of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and of His effects is signified.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The properties of the dove lead us to understand the dove's <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and the effects of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> in the same way. Because from the very fact that the dove has such properties, it results that it signifies the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether it was becoming, when Christ was baptized that the Father's voice should be heard, bearing witness to the Son?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it was unbecoming when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> for the Father's voice to be heard bearing witness to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. For the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, according as they have appeared visibly, are said to have been visibly sent. But it does not become the Father to be sent, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> makes it clear (De Trin. ii). Neither, therefore, (does it become Him) to appear.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the voice gives expression to the word conceived in the heart. But the Father is not the Word. Therefore He is unfittingly manifested by a voice.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the Man-Christ did not begin to be <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> at His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, as some <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have stated: but He was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> from the beginning of His conception. Therefore the Father's voice should have proclaimed <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Godhead at His nativity rather than at His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse17">Matthew 3:17</a>): "Behold a voice from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, saying: This is My beloved Son in whom I am well pleased."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>), that which is accomplished in our <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> should be manifested in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which was the exemplar of ours. Now the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which the faithful receive is hallowed by the invocation and the power of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>; according to <a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew 28:19</a>: "Go ye and teach all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." Wherefore, as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on <a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse16">Matthew 3:16-17</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> is shown forth in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> Himself is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> descended in the shape of a dove: the Father's voice is heard bearing witness to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>." Therefore it was becoming that in that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> the Father should be manifested by a voice.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The visible mission adds something to the apparition, to wit, the authority of the sender. Therefore the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> who are from another, are said not only to appear, but also to be sent visibly. But the Father, who is not from another, can appear indeed, but cannot be sent visibly.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The Father is manifested by the voice, only as producing the voice or speaking by it. And since it is proper to the Father to produce the Word--that is, to utter or to speak--therefore was it most becoming that the Father should be manifested by a voice, because the voice designates the word. Wherefore the very voice to which the Father gave utterance bore witness to the Sonship of the Word. And just as the form of the dove, in which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was made manifest, is not the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, nor is the form of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in which the Son Himself was manifested, the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, so neither does the voice belong to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> of the Word or of the Father who spoke. Hence (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse37">John 5:37</a>) <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> says: "Neither have you heard His," i.e. the Father's, "voice at any time, nor seen His shape." By which words, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. xl in Joan.), "He gradually leads them to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the philosophical <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and shows them that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has neither voice nor shape, but is above all such forms and utterances." And just as the whole <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> made both the dove and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> assumed by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, so also they formed the voice: yet the Father alone as speaking is manifested by the voice, just as the Son alone assumed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> alone is manifested in the dove, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [Fulgentius, De Fide ad Petrum] makes evident.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It was becoming that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Godhead should not be proclaimed to all in His nativity, but rather that It should be hidden while He was subject to the defects of infancy. But when He attained to the perfect age, when the time came for Him to teach, to work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and to draw men to Himself then did it behoove His Godhead to be attested from on high by the Father's testimony, so that His teaching might become the more credible. Hence He says (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse37">John 5:37</a>): "The Father Himself who sent Me, hath given testimony of Me." And specially at the time of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, by which men are born again into adopted sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sons by adoption are made to be like unto His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> Son, according to <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse29">Romans 8:29</a>: "Whom He foreknew, He also <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to be made conformable to the image of His Son." Hence <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (Super Matth. ii) that when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> descended on Him, and the Father's voice was heard saying: "'This is My beloved Son,' that we might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, from what was accomplished in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that after being washed in the waters of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> comes down upon us from on high, and that the Father's voice declares us to have become the adopted sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."
