<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether all sorrow is evil?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that all sorrow is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> [Nemesius, De Nat. Hom. xix.] says: "All sorrow is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, from its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." Now what is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> always and everywhere. Therefore, all sorrow is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which all, even the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, avoid, is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But all avoid sorrow, even the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, since as stated in Ethic. vii, 11, "though the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not aim at pleasure, yet he aims at avoiding sorrow." Therefore sorrow is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as bodily <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is the object and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of bodily pain, so <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is the object and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sorrow in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But every bodily pain is a bodily <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore every <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> sorrow is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Sorrow for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is contrary to pleasure in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But pleasure in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: wherefore in condemnation of certain men, it is written (<a href="../bible/pro002.htm#verse14">Proverbs 2:14</a>), that "they were glad when they had done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." Therefore sorrow for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing may be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in two ways: first considered simply and in itself; and thus all sorrow is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, because the mere fact of a man's <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> being uneasy about a present <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, is itself an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, because it hinders the response of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Secondly, a thing is said to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, on the supposition of something else: thus shame is said to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, on the supposition of a shameful <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> done, as stated in Ethic. iv, 9. Accordingly, supposing the presence of something saddening or painful, it is a sign of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> if a man is in sorrow or pain on account of this present <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For if he were not to be in sorrow or pain, this could only be either because he feels it not, or because he does not reckon it as something unbecoming, both of which are manifest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. Consequently it is a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, that, supposing an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to be present, sorrow or pain should ensue. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. viii, 14): "It is also a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thing that he sorrows for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> he has lost: for had not some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> remained in his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, he could not be punished by the loss of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." Because, however, in the science of Morals, we consider things individually--for actions are concerned about <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>--that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> on some supposition, should be considered as <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: just as that which is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> on some supposition, is judged to be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, as stated in Ethic. iii, 1, and likewise above (Question 6, Article 6).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> [Nemesius] is speaking of sorrow on the part of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> it, but not on the part of the subject that feels and rejects the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And from this point of view, all shun sorrow, inasmuch as they shun <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: but they do not shun the perception and rejection of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. The same also applies to bodily pain: because the perception and rejection of bodily <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Second and Third Objections.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether sorrow can be a virtuous good?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that sorrow is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. For that which leads to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 33), "<a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> seems to have feared lest he should be troubled overmuch by sorrow, and so, instead of entering into the rest of the blessed, be consigned to the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> of sinners." Therefore sorrow is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is praiseworthy and <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>. But sorrow lessens praise or <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/2co009.htm#verse7">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>): "Everyone, as he hath determined in his heart, not with sadness, or of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>." Therefore sorrow is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 15), "sorrow is concerned about those things which happen against our will." But not to will those things which are actually taking place, is to have a will opposed to the decree of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to Whose <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> whatever is done is subject. Since, then, conformity of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> to the Divine <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the rectitude of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as stated above (Question 19, Article 9), it seems that sorrow is incompatible with rectitude of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and that consequently it is not <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Whatever <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> the reward of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>. But such is sorrow; as is evident from <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse5">Matthew 5:5</a>: "Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted." Therefore sorrow is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In so far as sorrow is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it can be a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. For it has been said above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>) that sorrow is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> inasmuch as it denotes perception and rejection of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. These two things, as regards bodily pain, are a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, to which it is due that the senses perceive, and that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> shuns, the harmful thing that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> pain. As regards interior sorrow, perception of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is sometimes due to a right judgment of reason; while the rejection of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, well disposed and detesting that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Now every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> results from these two things, the rectitude of the reason and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Wherefore it is evident that sorrow may be a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> All the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> should be regulated according to the rule of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, which is the root of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; but excessive sorrow, of which <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is speaking, oversteps this rule, and therefore it fails to be a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as sorrow for an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> arises from a right <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and reason, which detest the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, so sorrow for a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is due to a perverse reason and will, which detest the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Consequently such sorrow is an obstacle to the praise and <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; for instance, when a man gives an <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> sorrowfully.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Some things do actually happen, not because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills, but because He permits them to happen--such as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Consequently a will that is opposed to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, whether in oneself or in another, is not discordant from the Divine will. Penal <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> happen actually, even by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will. But it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the rectitude of his will, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should will them in themselves: but only that he should not revolt against the order of Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as stated above (Question 19, Article 10).

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether sorrow can be a useful good?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that sorrow cannot be a useful <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/sir030.htm#verse25">Sirach 30:25</a>): "Sadness hath killed many, and there is no profit in it."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, choice is of that which is useful to an end. But sorrow is not an object of choice; in fact, "a thing without sorrow is to be chosen rather than the same thing with sorrow" (Topic. iii, 2). Therefore sorrow is not a useful <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "Everything is for the sake of its own operation," as stated in De Coel. ii, 3. But "sorrow hinders operation," as stated in Ethic. x, 5. Therefore sorrow is not a useful <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> seeks only that which is useful. But according to <a href="../bible/ecc007.htm#verse5">Ecclesiastes 7:5</a>, "the heart of the wise is where there is mourning, and the heart of fools where there is mirth." Therefore sorrow is useful.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A twofold movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> ensues from a present <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. One is that whereby the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is opposed to the present <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; and, in this respect, sorrow is of no use; because that which is present, cannot be not present. The other movement arises in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> to the effect of avoiding or expelling the saddening <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: and, in this respect, sorrow is of use, if it be for something which ought to be avoided. Because there are two reasons for which it may be right to avoid a thing. First, because it should be avoided in itself, on account of its being contrary to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; for instance, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Wherefore sorrow for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is useful as inducing a man to avoid <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/2co007.htm#verse9">2 Corinthians 7:9</a>): "I am glad: not because you were made sorrowful, but because you were made sorrowful unto penance." Secondly, a thing is to be avoided, not as though it were <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in itself, but because it is an occasion of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; either through one's being attached to it, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> it too much, or through one's being thrown headlong thereby into an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as is evident in the case of temporal goods. And, in this respect, sorrow for temporal goods may be useful; according to <a href="../bible/ecc007.htm#verse3">Ecclesiastes 7:3</a>: "It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to the house of feasting: for in that we are put in mind of the end of all."

<p>Moreover, sorrow for that which ought to be avoided is always useful, since it adds another motive for avoiding it. Because the very <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is in itself a thing to be avoided: while everyone avoids sorrow for its own sake, just as everyone seeks the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and pleasure in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore just as pleasure in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> makes one seek the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> more earnestly, so sorrow for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> makes one avoid <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> more eagerly.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This passage is to be taken as referring to excessive sorrow, which consumes the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: for such sorrow paralyzes the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and hinders it from shunning <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as stated above (Question 37, Article 2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as any object of choice becomes less eligible by reason of sorrow, so that which ought to be shunned is still more to be shunned by reason of sorrow: and, in this respect, sorrow is useful.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Sorrow <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by an action hinders that action: but sorrow for the cessation of an action, makes one do it more earnestly.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether bodily pain is the greatest evil?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that pain is the greatest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Because "the worst is contrary to the best" (Ethic. viii, 10). But a certain pleasure is the greatest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, viz. the pleasure of bliss. Therefore a certain pain is the greatest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> greatest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, because it is his last end. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> Happiness consists in his "having whatever he will, and in willing naught amiss," as stated above (3, 4, Objection 5; 5, 8, Objection 3). Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> greatest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> consists in the fulfilment of his will. Now pain consists in something happening contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> declares (De Civ. Dei xiv, 6,15). Therefore pain is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> greatest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> argues thus (Soliloq. i, 12): "We are composed of two parts, i.e. of a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and a body, whereof the body is the inferior. Now the sovereign <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is the greatest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the better part: while the supreme <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is the greatest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of the inferior part. But wisdom is the greatest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; while the worst thing in the body is pain. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> greatest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is to be wise: while his greatest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is to suffer pain."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Guilt is a greater <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> than punishment, as was stated in the I, 48, 6. But sorrow or pain belongs to the punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, just as the enjoyment of changeable things is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of guilt. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Vera Relig. xii): "What is pain of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, except for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be deprived of that which it was wont to enjoy, or had hoped to enjoy? And this is all that is called <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, i.e. <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and the punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." Therefore sorrow or pain is not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> greatest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is impossible for any sorrow or pain to be <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> greatest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For all sorrow or pain is either for something that is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, or for something that is apparently <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in reality. Now pain or sorrow for that which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> cannot be the greatest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: for there is something worse, namely, either not to reckon as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that which is really <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, or not to reject it. Again, sorrow or pain, for that which is apparently <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but really <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, cannot be the greatest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, for it would be worse to be altogether separated from that which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Hence it is impossible for any sorrow or pain to be <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> greatest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Pleasure and sorrow have two <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> points in common: namely, a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> judgment concerning <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; and the right order of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in approving of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and rejecting <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Thus it is clear that in pain or sorrow there is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, by the removal of which they become worse: and yet there is not an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in every pleasure, by the removal of which the pleasure is better. Consequently, a pleasure can be <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> highest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, in the way above stated (34, 3): whereas sorrow cannot be <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> greatest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The very fact of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> being opposed to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. And for this reason, sorrow or pain cannot be the greatest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; because it has an admixture of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> That which harms the better thing is worse than that which harms the worse. Now a thing is called <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> "because it harms," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion xii). Therefore that which is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a greater <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> than that which is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to the body. Therefore this argument does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>: nor does <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> give it as his own, but as taken from another [Cornelius Celsus].
