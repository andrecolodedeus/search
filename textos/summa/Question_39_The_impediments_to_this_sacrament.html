<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the female sex is an impediment to receiving Orders?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the female sex is no impediment to receiving Orders. For the office of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> is greater than the office of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, since a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> stands midway between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, just as the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> does between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and people. Now the office of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> was sometimes granted to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, as may be gathered from <a href="../bible/2ki022.htm#verse14">2 Kings 22:14</a>. Therefore the office of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> also may be competent to them.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as Order pertains to a kind of pre-eminence, so does a position of authority as well as <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> and the religious state. Now authority is entrusted to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, as in the case of abbesses, and in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, as in the case of Debbora, who judged <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> (<a href="../bible/jdg002.htm">Judges 2</a>). Moreover <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> and the religious life are also befitting to them. Therefore the Orders of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are also competent to them.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the power of orders is founded in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But sex is not in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore difference in sex makes no difference to the reception of Orders.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse12">1 Timothy 2:12</a>): "I suffer not a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to teach (in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>),* nor to use authority over the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." [The words in parenthesis are from <a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse34">1 Corinthians 14:34</a>, "Let <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> keep silence in the churches."]

<p>Further, the crown is required previous to receiving Orders, albeit not for the validity of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. But the crown or <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> is not befitting to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> according to <a href="../bible/1co011.htm">1 Corinthians 11</a>. Neither therefore is the receiving of Orders.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Certain things are required in the recipient of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> as being requisite for the validity of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, and if such things be lacking, one can receive neither the sacrament nor the reality of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Other things, however, are required, not for the validity of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but for its lawfulness, as being congruous to the sacrament; and without these one receives the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but not the reality of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Accordingly we must say that the male sex is required for receiving Orders not only in the second, but also in the first way. Wherefore even though a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> were made the object of all that is done in conferring Orders, she would not receive Orders, for since a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is a sign, not only the thing, but the signification of the thing, is required in all sacramental actions; thus it was stated above (Question 32, Article 2) that in <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to have a sick <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in order to signify the need of healing. Accordingly, since it is not possible in the female sex to signify eminence of degree, for a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is in the state of subjection, it follows that she cannot receive the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacrament of Order</a>. Some, however, have asserted that the male sex is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the lawfulness and not for the validity of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, because even in the Decretals (cap. Mulieres dist. 32; cap. Diaconissam, 27, qu. i) mention is made of deaconesses and priestesses. But deaconess there denotes a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who shares in some act of a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, namely who reads the homilies in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and priestess [presbytera] means a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, for the word "presbyter" means elder.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Prophecy is not a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> but a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore there it is not the signification, but only the thing which is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. And since in matters pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> does not differ from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as to the thing (for sometimes a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is found to be better than many men as regards the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>), it follows that she can receive the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> and the like, but not the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacrament of Orders</a>.

<p>And thereby appears the Reply to the Second and Third Objections. However, as to abbesses, it is said that they have not ordinary authority, but delegated as it were, on account of the danger of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> living together. But Debbora exercised authority in temporal, not in <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> matters, even as now <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> may have temporal power.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether boys and those who lack the use of reason can receive Orders?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that boys and those who lack the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> cannot receive Orders. For, as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 25), the sacred canons have appointed a certain fixed age in those who receive Orders. But this would not be if boys could receive the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacrament of Orders</a>. Therefore, etc.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacrament of Orders</a> ranks above the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>. Now children and those who lack the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> cannot contract <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>. Neither therefore can they receive Orders.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, act and power are in the same subject, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Somn. et Vigil. i). Now the act of Orders requires the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Therefore the power of Orders does also.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> one who is raised to Orders before the age of discretion is sometimes allowed to exercise them without being reordained, as appears from Extra., De Cler. per salt. prom. But this would not be the case if he had not received Orders. Therefore a boy can receive Orders.

<p>Further, boys can receive other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> in which a character is imprinted, namely <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> and Confirmation. Therefore in like manner they can receive Orders.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Boyhood and other defects which remove the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> occasion an impediment to act. Wherefore the like are unfit to receive all those <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which require an act on the part of the recipient of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, such as Penance, Matrimony, and so forth. But since infused powers like <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers precede acts--although acquired powers follow acts--and the removal of that which comes after does not entail the removal of what comes first, it follows that children and those who lack the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> can receive all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> in which an act on the part of the recipient is not required for the validity of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but some <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power is conferred from above; with this difference, however, that in the <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>the age of discretion is required out of respect for the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but not for its lawfulness, nor for its validity. Hence some can without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be raised to the <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>before the years of discretion, if there be an urgent reason for it and hope of their proficiency. and they are validly ordained; for although at the time they are not qualified for the offices entrusted to them, they will become qualified by being habituated thereto. For the higher Orders, however, the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> is required both out of respect for, and for the lawfulness of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, not only on account of the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a> annexed thereto, but also because the handling of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> is entrusted to them [See Acts of the Council of Trent: De Reform., Sess. xxii, cap. 4,11,12. But for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopate</a> whereby a man receives power also over the <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">mystical body</a>, the act of accepting the pastoral care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> is required; wherefore the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the validity of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. Some, however, maintain that the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the validity of the sacrament in all the Orders. but this statement is not confirmed either by authority or by reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated in the Article, not all that is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the lawfulness of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is required for its validity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> is consent, which cannot be without the use of reason. Whereas in the reception of Orders no act is required on the part of the recipients since no act on their part is expressed in their <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. Hence there is no comparison.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Act and power are in the same subject; yet sometimes a power, such as the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, precedes its act; and thus it is in the case in point.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the state of slavery is an impediment to receiving Orders?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the state of slavery is not an impediment to receiving Orders. For corporal subjection is not incompatible with <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> authority. But in a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> there is corporal subjection. Therefore he is not hindered from receiving the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> authority which is given in orders.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which is an occasion for <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> should not be an impediment to the reception of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Now such is slavery, for the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> counsels a man, if possible, rather to remain in slavery (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse21">1 Corinthians 7:21</a>). Therefore it should not hinder him from being raised to Orders.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is more disgraceful for a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> to become a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> than for a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> to be made a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>. Yet a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> may lawfully be sold as a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a>; for a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Nola, Paulinus, to wit, sold himself as a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> as related by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Dial. ii.). Much more therefore can a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> be made a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It would seem that it is an impediment to the validity of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. For a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, on account of her subjection, cannot receive the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacrament of Orders</a>. But greater still is the subjection in a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a>; since <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was not given to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as his handmaid (for which reason she was not made from his feet). Therefore neither can a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> receive this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, a man, from the fact that he receives an Order, is bound to minister in that Order. But he cannot at the same time serve his carnal master and exercise his <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> ministry. Therefore it would seem that he cannot receive Orders, since the master must be indemnified.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> By receiving Orders a man pledges himself to the Divine offices. And since no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can give what is not his, a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> who has not the disposal of himself, cannot be raised to Orders. If, however, he be raised, he receives the Order, because freedom is not required for the validity of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, although it is requisite for its lawfulness, since it hinders not the power, but the act only. The same reason applies to all who are under an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to others, such as those who are in debt and like <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The reception of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power involves also an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to certain bodily actions, and consequently it is hindered by bodily subjection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may take an occasion for <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> from many other things which do not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> a hindrance to the exercise of Orders.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The blessed Paulinus did this out of the abundance of his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, being led by the spirit of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; as was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the result of his action, since by his becoming a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a>, many of his flock were freed from slavery. Hence we must not draw a conclusion from this particular instance, since "where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty" (<a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse17">2 Corinthians 3:17</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The sacramental signs signify by reason of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> likeness. Now a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is a subject by her <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, whereas a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> is not. Hence the comparison fails.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> If he be ordained, his master <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> and not dissenting, by this very fact he becomes a freedman. But if his master be in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and he who presented him are bound to pay the master double the <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave's</a> value, if they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> him to be a slave. Otherwise if the <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> has possessions of his own, he is bound to buy his freedom, else he would have to return to the bondage of his master, notwithstanding the impossibility of his exercising his Order.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether a man should be debarred from receiving Orders on account of homicide?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a man ought not to be debarred from receiving Orders on account of homicide. Because our Orders originated with the office of the Levites, as stated in the previous Distinction (Sent. iv, D, 24). But the Levites <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> their hands by shedding the blood of their brethren (<a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse29">Exodus 32:29</a>). Therefore neither should anyone in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> be debarred from receiving Orders on account of the shedding of blood.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no one should be debarred from a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> on account of an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now blood is sometimes shed for <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>' sake, for instance by a judge; and he who has the office would <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> if he did not shed it. Therefore he is not hindered on that account from receiving Orders.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, punishment is not due save for a fault. Now sometimes a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> commits homicide without fault, for instance by defending himself, or again by mishap. Therefore he ought not to incur the punishment of <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Against this there are many canonical statutes [Cap. Miror; cap. Clericum; cap. De his Cler., dist. 1; cap. Continebatur, De homic. volunt.], as also the custom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> All the Orders bear a relation to the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, which is the sacrament of the peace vouchsafed to us by the shedding of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> blood. And since homicide is most opposed to peace, and those who slay are conformed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> slayers rather than to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> slain, to whom all the ministers of the aforesaid sacrament ought to be conformed, it follows that it is unlawful, although not invalid, for homicides to be raised to Orders.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> inflicted the punishment of blood, whereas the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> does not. Hence the comparison fails between the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> and those of the New, which is a sweet yoke and a light burden (<a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse30">Matthew 11:30</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">Irregularity</a> is incurred not only on account of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but chiefly on account of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> being unfit to administer the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>. Hence the judge and all who take part with him in a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of blood, are <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregular</a>, because the shedding of blood is unbecoming to the ministers of that sacrament.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> No one does a thing without being the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> thereof, and in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> this is something <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. Hence he who by mishap slays a man without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that it is a man, is not called a homicide, nor does he incur <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a> (unless he was occupying himself in some unlawful manner, or failed to take sufficient care, since in this case the slaying becomes somewhat <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>). But this is not because he is not in fault, since <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a> is incurred even without fault. Wherefore even he who in a particular case slays a man in self-defense without committing a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is none the less <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregular</a> <span class="stiki"><a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> is speaking according to the <a href="../cathen/09056a.htm">canon law</a> of his time. This is no longer the case now.</span>

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether those of illegitimate birth should be debarred from receiving Orders?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that those who are of <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> birth should not be debarred from receiving Orders. For the son should not bear the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> of the father (<a href="../bible/eze018.htm#verse20">Ezekiel 18:20</a>); and yet he would if this were an impediment to his receiving Orders. Therefore, etc.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, one's own fault is a greater impediment than the fault of another. Now unlawful intercourse does not always debar a man from receiving Orders. Therefore neither should he be debarred by the unlawful intercourse of his father.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/deu023.htm#verse2">Deuteronomy 23:2</a>): "A mamzer, that is to say, one born of a prostitute, shall not enter into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Lord until the tenth generation." Much less therefore should he be ordained.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Those who are ordained are placed in a position of dignity over others. Hence by a kind of propriety it is requisite that they should be without reproach, not for the validity but for the lawfulness of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, namely that they should be of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> repute, bedecked with a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> life, and not publicly penitent. And since a man's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> name is bedimmed by a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> origin, therefore those also who are born of an unlawful union are debarred from receiving orders, unless they receive a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>; and this is the more difficult to obtain, according as their origin is more discreditable.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">Irregularity</a> is not a punishment due for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Hence it is clear that those who are of <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> birth do not bear the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> of their father through being <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregular</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> What a man does by his own act can be removed by repentance and by a contrary act; not so the things which are from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence the comparison fails between <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> origin.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether lack of members should be an impediment?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a man ought not to be debarred from receiving Orders on account of a lack of members. For one who is afflicted should not receive additional affliction. Therefore a man ought not to be deprived of the degree of Orders on account of his suffering a bodily defect.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, integrity of discretion is more <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the act of orders than integrity of body. But some can be ordained before the years of discretion. Therefore they can also be ordained though deficient in body.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The like were debarred from the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> (<a href="../bible/lev021.htm#verse18">Leviticus 21:18, seqq.</a>). Much more therefore should they be debarred in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>.

<p>We shall speak of <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">bigamy</a> in the treatise on Matrimony (66).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As appears from what we have said above (3,4,5), a man is disqualified from receiving Orders, either on account of an impediment to the act, or on account of an impediment affecting his personal comeliness. Hence he who suffers from a lack of members is debarred from receiving Orders, if the defect be such as to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a notable blemish, whereby a man's comeliness is bedimmed (for instance if his nose be cut off) or the exercise of his Order imperilled; otherwise he is not debarred. This integrity, however, is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the lawfulness and not for the validity of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.
