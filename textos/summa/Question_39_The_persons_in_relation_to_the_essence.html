<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether in God the essence is the same as the person?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is not the same as <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. For whenever <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is the same as <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> or "suppositum," there can be only one "suppositum" of one <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as is clear in the case of all separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. For in those things which are really one and the same, one cannot be multiplied apart from the other. But in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, as is clear from what is above expounded (28, 3; 30, 2). Therefore <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is not the same as <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, simultaneous affirmation and negation of the same things in the same respect cannot be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. But affirmation and negation are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. For <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is distinct, whereas <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is not. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> are not the same.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, nothing can be subject to itself. But <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is subject to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; whence it is called "suppositum" or "hypostasis." Therefore <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is not the same as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. vi, 7): "When we say the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Father we mean nothing else but the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the Father."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of this question is quite clear if we consider the divine simplicity. For it was shown above (Question 3, Article 3) that the divine simplicity requires that in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is the same as "suppositum," which in <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> is nothing else than <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. But a difficulty seems to arise from the fact that while the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are multiplied, the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> nevertheless retains its unity. And because, as <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Trin. i), "relation multiplies the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>," some have thought that in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> differ, forasmuch as they held the relations to be "adjacent"; considering only in the relations the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of "reference to another," and not the relations as realities. But as it was shown above (Question 28, Article 2) in creatures relations are <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>, whereas in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> they are the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> itself. Thence it follows that in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is not really distinct from <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; and yet that the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are really distinguished from each other. For <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, as above stated (29, 4), signifies relation as subsisting in the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But relation as referred to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> does not differ therefrom really, but only in our way of thinking; while as referred to an opposite relation, it has a real distinction by virtue of that opposition. Thus there are one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> There cannot be a distinction of "suppositum" in creatures by means of relations, but only by <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> principles; because in creatures relations are not subsistent. But in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> relations are subsistent, and so by reason of the opposition between them they distinguish the "supposita"; and yet the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is not distinguished, because the relations themselves are not distinguished from each other so far as they are identified with the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> differ in our way of thinking, it follows that something can be denied of the one and affirmed of the other; and therefore, when we suppose the one, we need not suppose the other.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Divine things are named by us after the way of <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things, as above explained (13, 1,3). And since <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> natures are individualized by <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> which is the subject of the specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it follows that <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> are called "subjects," "supposita," or "hypostases." So the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are named "supposita" or "hypostases," but not as if there really <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> any real "supposition" or "subjection."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether it must be said that the three persons are of one essence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem not right to say that the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are of one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. For <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (De Synod.) that the Father, Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> "are indeed three by <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, but one in harmony." But the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Therefore the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are not of one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, nothing is to be affirmed of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> except what can be confirmed by the authority of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>, as appears from <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. i). Now <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> never says that the Father, Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are of one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Therefore this should not be asserted.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is the same as the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. It suffices therefore to say that the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are of one <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it is not usual to say that the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; but rather that the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Therefore it does not seem fitting to say that the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are of one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. vii, 6) that we do not say that the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are "from one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> [ex una essentia]," lest we should seem to indicate a distinction between the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But prepositions which imply transition, denote the oblique case. Therefore it is equally wrong to say that the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are "of one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> [unius essentiae]."

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, nothing should be said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> which can be occasion of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. Now, to say that the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are of one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> or <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, furnishes occasion of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. For, as <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (De Synod.): "One <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> predicated of the Father and the Son signifies either one subsistent, with two denominations; or one <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> divided into two imperfect <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>; or a third prior <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> taken and assumed by the other two." Therefore it must not be said that the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are of one <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Maxim. iii) that the word <em>homoousion</em>, which the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a> adopted against the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, means that the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are of one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As above explained (13, 1,2), divine things are named by our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, not as they really are in themselves, for in that way it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> them not; but in a way that belongs to things <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>. And as in the objects of the senses, whence the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> derives its <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is made <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> by the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and thus the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is as the form, and the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> is the "suppositum" of the form; so also in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is taken as the form of the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, according to our mode of signification. Now in creatures we say that every form belongs to that whereof it is the form; as the health and beauty of a man belongs to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But we do not say of that which has a form, that it belongs to the form, unless some adjective qualifies the form; as when we say: "That <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is of a handsome figure," or: "This <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is of perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>." In like manner, as in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are multiplied, and the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is not multiplied, we speak of one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of the one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, provided that these genitives be understood as designating the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">Substance</a> is here taken for the "hypostasis," and not for the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although we may not find it declared in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> in so many words that the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are of one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, nevertheless we find it so stated as regards the meaning; for instance, "I and the Father are one (<a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse30">John 10:30</a>)," and "I am in the Father, and the Father in Me (<a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse38">John 10:38</a>)"; and there are many other texts of the same import.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Because "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>" designates the principle of action while "<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>" comes from being [essendo], things may be said to be of one <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which agree in some action, as all things which give heat; but only those things can be said to be of "one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>" which have one being. So the divine unity is better described by saying that the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are "of one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>," than by saying they are "of one <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">Form</a>, in the absolute sense, is wont to be designated as belonging to that of which it is the form, as we say "the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>." On the other hand, the thing having form is not wont to be designated as belonging to the form except when we wish to qualify or designate the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. In which case two genitives are required, one signifying the form, and the other signifying the determination of the form, as, for instance, when we say, "<a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> is of great <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> [magnae virtutis]," or else one genitive must have the force of two, as, for instance, "he is a man of blood"--that is, he is a man who sheds much blood [multi sanguinis]. So, because the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> signifies a form as regards the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, it may properly be said that the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; but we cannot say the converse, unless we add some term to designate the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; as, for instance, the Father is a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the "divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>"; or, the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are "of one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The preposition "from" or "out of" does not designate the habitude of a <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">formal</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but rather the habitude of an efficient or material <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> are in all cases distinguished from those things of which they are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. For nothing can be its own <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, nor its own active principle. Yet a thing may be its own form, as appears in all immaterial things. So, when we say, "three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>," taking <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> as having the habitude of form, we do not mean that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is different from <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, which we should mean if we said, "three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> from the same <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (De Synod.): "It would be prejudicial to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things, if we had to do away with them, just because some do not think them holy. So if some misunderstand <em>homoousion</em>, what is that to me, if I understand it rightly? . . . The oneness of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> does not result from division, or from union or from community of possession, but from one <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> being proper to both Father and Son."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether essential names should be predicated in the singular of the three persons?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> names, as the name "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," should not be predicated in the singular of the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, but in the plural. For as "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" signifies "one that has humanity," so <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> signifies "one that has Godhead." But the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are three who have Godhead. Therefore the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are "three Gods."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse1">Genesis 1:1</a>, where it is said, "In the beginning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth," the Hebrew original has "Elohim," which may be rendered "Gods" or "Judges": and this word is used on account of the plurality of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Therefore the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are "several Gods," and not "one" <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, this word "thing" when it is said absolutely, seems to belong to <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. But it is predicated of the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in the plural. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 5): "The things that are the objects of our future <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> are the Father, Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." Therefore other <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> names can be predicated in the plural of the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, as this word "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" signifies "a being who has Deity," so also this word "person" signifies a being subsisting in an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But we say there are three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. So for the same reason we can say there are "three Gods."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse4">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>): "Hear, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> is one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> names signify the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> after the manner of substantives; while others signify it after the manner of adjectives. Those which signify it as substantives are predicated of the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in the singular only, and not in the plural. Those which signify the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> as adjectives are predicated of the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in the plural. The reason of this is that substantives signify something by way of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, while adjectives signify something by way of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, which adheres to a subject. Now just as <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> has <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of itself, so also it has of itself unity or multitude; wherefore the singularity or plurality of a substantive name depends upon the form signified by the name. But as <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> have their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in a subject, so they have unity or plurality from their subject; and therefore the singularity and plurality of adjectives depends upon their "supposita." In creatures, one form does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in several "supposita" except by unity of order, as the form of an ordered multitude. So if the names signifying such a form are substantives, they are predicated of many in the singular, but otherwise if they adjectives. For we say that many men are a college, or an army, or a people; but we say that many men are collegians. Now in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is signified by way of a form, as above explained (2), which, indeed, is simple and supremely one, as shown above (3, 7; 11, 4). So, names which signify the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> in a substantive manner are predicated of the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in the singular, and not in the plural. This, then, is the reason why we say that <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a>, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> and Cicero are "three men"; whereas we do not say the Father, Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are "three Gods," but "one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>"; forasmuch as in the three "supposita" of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> there are three humanities, whereas in the three divine Persons there is but one divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. On the other hand, the names which signify <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> in an adjectival manner are predicated of the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> plurally, by reason of the plurality of "supposita." For we say there are three "existent" or three "wise" beings, or three "<a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>," "uncreated," and "immense" beings, if these terms are understood in an adjectival sense. But if taken in a substantive sense, we say "one uncreated, immense, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> being," as <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> declares.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Though the name "God" signifies a being having Godhead, nevertheless the mode of signification is different. For the name "God" is used substantively; whereas "having Godhead" is used adjectively. Consequently, although there are "three having Godhead," it does not follow that there are three Gods.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Various languages have diverse modes of expression. So as by reason of the plurality of "supposita" the Greeks said "three hypostases," so also in Hebrew "Elohim" is in the plural. We, however, do not apply the plural either to "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" or to "<a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>," lest plurality be referred to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This word "thing" is one of the transcendentals. Whence, so far as it is referred to relation, it is predicated of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the plural; whereas, so far as it is referred to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, it is predicated in the singular. So <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says, in the passage quoted, that "the same <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> is a thing supreme."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The form signified by the word "person" is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> or <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but personality. So, as there are three personalities--that is, three personal properties in the Father, Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>--it is predicated of the three, not in the singular, but in the plural.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the concrete essential names can stand for the person?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the concrete, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> names cannot stand for the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, so that we can <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> say "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> begot <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." For, as the logicians say, "a singular term signifies what it stands for." But this name "God" seems to be a singular term, for it cannot be predicated in the plural, as above explained (3). Therefore, since it signifies the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, it stands for <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, and not for <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a term in the subject is not modified by a term in the predicate, as to its signification; but only as to the sense signified in the predicate. But when I say, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> creates," this name "God" stands for the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. So when we say "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> begot," this term "God" cannot by reason of the notional predicate, stand for <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if this be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> begot," because the Father generates; for the same reason this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not beget," because the Son does not beget. Therefore there is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who begets, and there is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who does not beget; and thus it follows that there are two Gods.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, if "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> begot <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," He begot either <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is Himself, or another <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But He did not beget <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is Himself; for, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. i, 1), "nothing begets itself." Neither did He beget another <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; as there is only one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore it is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> to say, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> begot <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, if "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> begot <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," He begot either <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who is the Father, or <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who is not the Father. If <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who is the Father, then <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father was begotten. If <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who is not the Father, then there is a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who is not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father: which is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Therefore it cannot be said that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> begot <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> In the Creed it is said, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some have said that this name "God" and the like, properly according to their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, stand for the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, but by reason of some notional adjunct are made to stand for the Person. This opinion apparently arose from considering the divine simplicity, which requires that in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He "who possesses" and "what is possessed" be the same. So He who possesses Godhead, which is signified by the name <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is the same as Godhead. But when we consider the proper way of expressing ourselves, the mode of signification must be considered no less than the thing signified. Hence as this word "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" signifies the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> as in Him Who possesses it, just as the name "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" signifies humanity in a subject, others more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> have said that this word "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," from its mode of signification, can, in its proper sense, stand for <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, as does the word "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." So this word "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" sometimes stands for the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, as when we say "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> creates"; because this predicate is attributed to the subject by reason of the form signified--that is, Godhead. But sometimes it stands for the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, either for only one, as when we say, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> begets," or for two, as when we say, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> spirates"; or for three, as when it is said: "To the King of ages, <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, invisible, the only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," etc. (<a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse17">1 Timothy 1:17</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although this name "God" agrees with singular terms as regards the form signified not being multiplied; nevertheless it agrees also with general terms so far as the form signified is to be found in several "supposita." So it need not always stand for the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> it signifies.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This holds good against those who say that the word "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" does not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> stand for <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The word "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" stands for the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in a different way from that in which this word "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" does; for since the form signified by this word "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>"--that is, humanity--is really divided among its different subjects, it stands of itself for the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, even if there is no adjunct determining it to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>--that is, to a distinct subject. The unity or community of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, however, is not a reality, but is only in the consideration of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. Hence this term "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" does not stand for the common <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, unless this is required by some adjunct, as when we say, "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>"; whereas the form signified by the name "God"--that is, the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>--is really one and common. So of itself it stands for the common <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but by some adjunct it may be restricted so as to stand for the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. So, when we say, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> generates," by reason of the notional act this name "God" stands for the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Father. But when we say, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not generate," there is no adjunct to determine this name to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Son, and hence the phrase means that generation is repugnant to the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. If, however, something be added belonging to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Son, this proposition, for instance, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> begotten does not beget," is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Consequently, it does not follow that there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> a "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> generator," and a "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> not generator"; unless there be an adjunct pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; as, for instance, if we were to say, "the Father is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the generator" and the "Son is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the non-generator" and so it does not follow that there are many Gods; for the Father and the Son are one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as was said above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> This is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, "the Father begot <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is Himself," because the word "Himself," as a reciprocal term, refers to the same "suppositum." Nor is this contrary to what <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. lxvi ad Maxim.) that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father begot another self [alterum se]," forasmuch as the word "se" is either in the ablative case, and then it means "He begot another from Himself," or it indicates a single relation, and thus points to identity of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. This is, however, either a figurative or an emphatic way of speaking, so that it would really mean, "He begot another most like to Himself." Likewise also it is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> to say, "He begot another <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," because although the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is another than the Father, as above explained (31, 2), nevertheless it cannot be said that He is "another <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>"; forasmuch as this adjective "another" would be understood to apply to the substantive <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and thus the meaning would be that there is a distinction of Godhead. Yet this proposition "He begot another <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" is tolerated by some, provided that "another" be taken as a substantive, and the word "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" be construed in apposition with it. This, however, is an inexact way of speaking, and to be avoided, for fear of giving occasion to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> To say, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> begot <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father," is wrong, because since the word "Father" is construed in apposition to "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," the word "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" is restricted to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Father; so that it would mean, "He begot <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is Himself the Father"; and then the Father would be spoken of as begotten, which is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Wherefore the negative of the proposition is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, "He begot <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who is not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father." If however, we understand these words not to be in apposition, and require something to be added, then, on the contrary, the affirmative proposition is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and the negative is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>; so that the meaning would be, "He begot <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who is the Father." Such a rendering however appears to be forced, so that it is better to say simply that the affirmative proposition is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, and the negative is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Yet Prepositivus said that both the negative and affirmative are <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, because this relative "Who" in the affirmative proposition can be referred to the "suppositum"; whereas in the negative it denotes both the thing signified and the "suppositum." Whence, in the affirmative the sense is that "to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father" is befitting to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Son; and in the negative sense is that "to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father," is to be removed from the Son's divinity as well as from His personality. This, however, appears to be irrational; since, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Peri Herm. ii), what is open to affirmation, is open also to negation.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether abstract essential names can stand for the person?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that abstract <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> names can stand for the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, so that this proposition is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, "Essence begets <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>." For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. vii, i, 2): "The Father and the Son are one Wisdom, because they are one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; and taken singly Wisdom is from Wisdom, as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> from <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, generation or corruption in ourselves implies generation or corruption of what is within us. But the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is generated. Therefore since the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is in the Son, it seems that the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is generated.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> are the same, as is clear from what is above explained (3, 3). But, as was shown, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to say that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> begets <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore this is also <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: "Essence begets <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, a predicate can stand for that of which it is predicated. But the Father is the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; therefore <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> can stand for the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Father. Thus the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> begets.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is "a thing begetting," because the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is the Father who is begetting. Therefore if the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is not begetting, the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> will be "a thing begetting," and "not begetting": which cannot be.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iv, 20): "The Father is the principle of the whole Godhead." But He is principle only by begetting or spirating. Therefore the Father begets or spirates the Godhead.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. i, 1): "Nothing begets itself." But if the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> begets the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, it begets itself only, since nothing <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as distinguished from the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> does not beget <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Concerning this, the <a href="../cathen/08406c.htm">abbot Joachim</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erred</a> in asserting that as we can say "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> begot <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," so we can say "Essence begot <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>": considering that, by reason of the divine simplicity <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is nothing else but the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. In this he was wrong, because if we wish to express ourselves correctly, we must take into account not only the thing which is signified, but also the mode of its signification as above stated (4). Now although "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" is really the same as "Godhead," nevertheless the mode of signification is not in each case the same. For since this word "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" signifies the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> in Him that possesses it, from its mode of signification it can of its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> stand for <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Thus the things which properly belong to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, can be predicated of this word, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," as, for instance, we can say "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is begotten" or is "Begetter," as above explained (4). The word "<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>," however, in its mode of signification, cannot stand for Person, because it signifies the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> as an abstract form. Consequently, what properly belongs to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whereby they are distinguished from each other, cannot be attributed to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. For that would imply distinction in the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, in the same way as there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> distinction in the "supposita."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> To express unity of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">Doctors</a> have sometimes expressed themselves with greater emphasis than the strict propriety of terms allows. Whence instead of enlarging upon such expressions we should rather explain them: thus, for instance, abstract names should be explained by concrete names, or even by personal names; as when we find "<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> from <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>"; or "wisdom from wisdom"; we should take the sense to be, "the Son" who is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and wisdom, is from the Father who is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and wisdom. Nevertheless, as regards these abstract names a certain order should be observed, forasmuch as what belongs to action is more nearly allied to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> because actions belong to "supposita." So "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>," and "wisdom from wisdom" are less inexact than "<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> from <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In creatures the one generated has not the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> numerically as the generator, but another <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, numerically distinct, which commences to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in it anew by generation, and ceases to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> by corruption, and so it is generated and corrupted <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>; whereas <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> begotten has the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> numerically as the begetter. So the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is not begotten either directly or <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> are really the same, nevertheless, on account of their different mode of signification, we must speak in a different way about each of them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is predicated of the Father by mode of identity by reason of the divine simplicity; yet it does not follow that it can stand for the Father, its mode of signification being different. This objection would hold <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as regards things which are predicated of another as the universal of a particular.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The difference between substantive and adjectival names consist in this, that the former carry their subject with them, whereas the latter do not, but add the thing signified to the substantive. Whence logicians are wont to say that the substantive is considered in the light of "suppositum," whereas the adjective indicates something added to the "suppositum." Therefore substantive personal terms can be predicated of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, because they are really the same; nor does it follow that a personal property makes a distinct <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; but it belongs to the "suppositum" implied in the substantive. But notional and personal adjectives cannot be predicated of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> unless we add some substantive. We cannot say that the "<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is begetting"; yet we can say that the "<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is a thing begetting," or that it is "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> begetting," if "thing" and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> stand for <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, but not if they stand for <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Consequently there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> no contradiction in saying that "<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is a thing begetting," and "a thing not begetting"; because in the first case "thing" stands for <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and in the second it stands for the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> So far as Godhead is one in several "supposita," it agrees in a certain degree with the form of a collective term. So when we say, "the Father is the principle of the whole Godhead," the term Godhead can be taken for all the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> together, inasmuch as it is the principle in all the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Nor does it follow that He is His own principle; as one of the people may be called the ruler of the people without being ruler of himself. We may also say that He is the principle of the whole Godhead; not as generating or spirating it, but as communicating it by generation and spiration.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the persons can be predicated of the essential terms?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> cannot be predicated of the concrete <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> names; so that we can say for instance, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>"; or "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>." For it is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> to say, "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," because it cannot be verified as regards any particular subject. For neither <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, nor anyone else is every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. In the same way this proposition, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>," cannot be verified of any one of the "supposita" of the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For the Father is not the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>; nor is the Son; nor is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. So to say, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>," is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the lower is not predicated of the higher except by <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> predication; as when I say, "animal is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>"; for it is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to animal to be <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But this name "God" as regards the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is as a general term to inferior terms, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 4). Therefore it seems that the names of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> cannot be predicated of this name "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," except in an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> sense.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says, in his sermon on <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> [Serm. ii, in coena Domini], "We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is one divinely named <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As above explained (5), although adjectival terms, whether personal or notional, cannot be predicated of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, nevertheless substantive terms can be so predicated, owing to the real identity of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. The divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is not only really the same as one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, but it is really the same as the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Whence, one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and two, and three, can be predicated of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> as if we were to say, "The <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is the Father, and the Son, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." And because this word "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" can of itself stand for the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, as above explained (4, ad 3), hence, as it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to say, "The <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>"; so likewise it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to say, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As above explained this term "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" can of itself stand for <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, whereas an adjunct is required for it to stand for the universal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. So it is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> to say, "Man is every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>"; because it cannot be verified of any particular <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> subject.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> this word "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" can of itself be taken for the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. So, although to say of any of the "supposita" of the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>," is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>, nevertheless it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. This was denied by Porretanus because he did not take note of this distinction.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When we say, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," or "the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is the Father," the predication is one of identity, and not of the lower in regard to a higher <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>: because in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is no universal and singular. Hence, as this proposition, "The Father is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" is of itself <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, so this proposition "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the Father" is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of itself, and by no means <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the essential names should be appropriated to the persons?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> names should not be appropriated to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. For whatever might verge on <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> should be avoided in the treatment of divine things; for, as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says, "careless words involve risk of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>" [In <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> Ep. lvii.]. But to appropriate to any one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> the names which are common to the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, may verge on <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; for it may be supposed either that such belong only to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to whom they are appropriated or that they belong to Him in a fuller degree than to the others. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> attributes should not be appropriated to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> attributes expressed in the abstract signify by mode of form. But one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is not as a form to another; since a form is not distinguished in subject from that of which it is the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> attributes, especially when expressed in the <a href="../cathen/01074a.htm">abstract</a>, are not to be appropriated to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, property is prior to the appropriated, for property is included in the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the appropriated. But the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> attributes, in our way of understanding, are prior to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; as what is common is prior to what is proper. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> attributes are not to be appropriated to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse24">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> For the manifestation of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> it is fitting that the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> attributes should be appropriated to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. For although the trinity of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by demonstration, as was above expounded (32, 1), nevertheless it is fitting that it be declared by things which are more <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us. Now the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> attributes of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are more clear to us from the standpoint of reason than the personal properties; because we can derive certain <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> attributes from creatures which are sources of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to us, such as we cannot obtain regarding the personal properties, as was above explained (32, 1). As, therefore, we make use of the likeness of the trace or image found in creatures for the manifestation of the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, so also in the same manner do we make use of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> attributes. And such a manifestation of the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> by the use of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> attributes is called "appropriation."

<p>The divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> can be manifested in a twofold manner by the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> attributes; in one way by similitude, and thus the things which belong to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> are appropriated to the Son, Who proceeds by way of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as Word. In another way by dissimilitude; as power is appropriated to the Father, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says, because fathers by reason of old age are sometimes feeble; lest anything of the kind be <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagined</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> attributes are not appropriated to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> as if they exclusively belonged to them; but in order to make the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> manifest by way of similitude, or dissimilitude, as above explained. So, no <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> can arise, but rather manifestation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> If the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> attributes were appropriated to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> as exclusively belonging to each of them, then it would follow that one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> would be as a form as regards another; which <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> altogether repudiates (De Trin. vi, 2), showing that the Father is wise, not by Wisdom begotten by Him, as though only the Son were Wisdom; so that the Father and the Son together only can be called wise, but not the Father without the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is called the Wisdom of the Father, because He is Wisdom from the Father Who is Wisdom. For each of them is of Himself Wisdom; and both together are one Wisdom. Whence the Father is not wise by the wisdom begotten by Him, but by the wisdom which is His own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> attribute is in its proper concept prior to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, according to our way of understanding; nevertheless, so far as it is appropriated, there is nothing to prevent the personal property from being prior to that which is appropriated. Thus color is posterior to body considered as body, but is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> prior to "white body," considered as white.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether the essential attributes are appropriated to the persons in a fitting manner by the holy doctors?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> attributes are appropriated to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> unfittingly by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>. For <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (De Trin. ii): "<a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">Eternity</a> is in the Father, the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in the Image; and use is in the Gift." In which words he designates three names proper to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>: the name of the "Father," the name "Image" proper to the Son (35, 2), and the name "Bounty" or "Gift," which is proper to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> (38, 2). He also designates three appropriated terms. For he appropriates "<a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>" to the Father, "<a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>" to the Son, and "use" to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. This he does apparently without reason. For "<a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>" imports duration of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; "<a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>," the principle of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; and 'use' belongs to the operation. But <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and operation are not found to be appropriated to any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Therefore the above terms are not fittingly appropriated to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 5): "Unity is in the Father, equality in the Son, and in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is the concord of equality and unity." This does not, however, seem fitting; because one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> does not receive formal denomination from what is appropriated to another. For the Father is not wise by the wisdom begotten, as above explained (37, 2, ad 1). But, as he subjoins, "All these three are one by the Father; all are equal by the Son, and all united by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." The above, therefore, are not fittingly appropriated to the Persons.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, to the Father is attributed "power," to the Son "wisdom," to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>." Nor does this seem fitting; for "strength" is part of power, whereas strength is found to be appropriated to the Son, according to the text, "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the strength [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: power] of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse24">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>). So it is likewise appropriated to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, according to the words, "strength [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>] came out from Him and healed all" (<a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse19">Luke 6:19</a>). Therefore power should not be appropriated to the Father.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Likewise <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. vi, 10): "What the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says, "From Him, and by Him, and in Him," is not to be taken in a confused sense." And (Contra Maxim. ii) "'from Him' refers to the Father, 'by Him' to the Son, 'in Him' to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.'" This, however, seems to be incorrectly said; for the words "in Him" seem to imply the relation of final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, which is first among the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. Therefore this relation of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> should be appropriated to the Father, Who is "the principle from no principle."

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Likewise, Truth is appropriated to the Son, according to <a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John 14:6</a>, "I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life"; and likewise "the book of life," according to <a href="../bible/psa039.htm#verse9">Psalm 39:9</a>, "In the beginning of the book it is written of Me," where a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> observes, "that is, with the Father Who is My head," also this word "Who is"; because on the text of <a href="../bible/isa065.htm#verse1">Isaiah 65:1</a>, "Behold I go to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>," a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> adds, "The Son speaks Who said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, I am Who am." These appear to belong to the Son, and are not appropriated. For "<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>," according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Vera Relig. 36), "is the supreme similitude of the principle without any dissimilitude." So it seems that it properly belongs to the Son, Who has a principle. Also the "book of life" seems proper to the Son, as signifying "a thing from another"; for every book is written by someone. This also, "Who is," appears to be proper to the Son; because if when it was said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, "I am Who am," the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> spoke, then <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> could have said, "He Who is Father, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> sent me to you," so also he could have said further, "He Who is the Father, and the Son, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> sent me to you," pointing out a certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. This, however, is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>; because no <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is Father, Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Therefore it cannot be common to the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, but is proper to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which is led to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from creatures, must consider <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> according to the mode derived from creatures. In considering any creature four points present themselves to us in due order. Firstly, the thing itself taken absolutely is considered as a being. Secondly, it is considered as one. Thirdly, its intrinsic power of operation and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> is considered. The fourth point of consideration embraces its relation to its effects. Hence this fourfold consideration comes to our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> in reference to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>According to the first point of consideration, whereby we consider <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> absolutely in His being, the appropriation mentioned by <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> applies, according to which "<a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>" is appropriated to the Father, "<a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>" to the Son, "use" to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. For "<a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>" as meaning a "being" without a principle, has a likeness to the property of the Father, Who is "a principle without a principle." Species or beauty has a likeness to the property of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. For beauty includes three <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>, "integrity" or "perfection," since those things which are impaired are by the very fact ugly; due "proportion" or "harmony"; and lastly, "brightness" or "clarity," whence things are called beautiful which have a bright color.

<p>The first of these has a likeness to the property of the Son, inasmuch as He as Son has in Himself <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> and perfectly the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Father. To insinuate this, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in his explanation (De Trin. vi, 10): "Where--that is, in the Son--there is supreme and primal life," etc.

<p>The second agrees with the Son's property, inasmuch as He is the express Image of the Father. Hence we see that an image is said to be beautiful, if it perfectly represents even an ugly thing. This is indicated by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> when he says (De Trin. vi, 10), "Where there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> wondrous proportion and primal equality," etc.

<p>The third agrees with the property of the Son, as the Word, which is the light and splendor of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 3). <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> alludes to the same when he says (De Trin. vi, 10): "As the perfect Word, not wanting in anything, and, so to speak, the art of the <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," etc.

<p>"Use" has a likeness to the property of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; provided the "use" be taken in a wide sense, as including also the sense of "to enjoy"; according as "to use" is to employ something at the beck of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and "to enjoy" means to use joyfully, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. x, 11). So "use," whereby the Father and the Son enjoy each other, agrees with the property of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as Love. This is what <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. vi, 10): "That love, that delectation, that felicity or beatitude, is called use by him" (<a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a>). But the "use" by which we enjoy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is likened to the property of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> as the Gift; and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> points to this when he says (De Trin. vi, 10): "In the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, the sweetness of the Begettor and the Begotten, pours out upon us mere creatures His immense bounty and <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>." Thus it is clear how "<a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>," "<a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>," and "use" are attributed or appropriated to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, but not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> or operation; because, being common, there is nothing in their concept to liken them to the properties of the Persons.

<p>The second consideration of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> regards Him as "one." In that view <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Doctr. Christ. i, 5) appropriates "unity" to the Father, "equality" to the Son, "concord" or "union" to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. It is manifest that these three imply unity, but in different ways. For "unity" is said absolutely, as it does not presuppose anything else; and for this reason it is appropriated to the Father, to Whom any other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is not presupposed since He is the "principle without principle." "Equality" implies unity as regards another; for that is equal which has the same <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> as another. So equality is appropriated to the Son, Who is the "principle from a principle." "Union" implies the unity of two; and is therefore appropriated to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, inasmuch as He proceeds from two. And from this we can understand what <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> means when he says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 5) that "The Three are one, by reason of the Father; They are equal by reason of the Son; and are united by reason of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." For it is clear that we trace a thing back to that in which we find it first: just as in this lower world we attribute life to the vegetative <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, because therein we find the first trace of life. Now "unity" is perceived at once in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Father, even if by an impossible hypothesis, the other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> were removed. So the other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> derive their unity from the Father. But if the other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> be removed, we do not find equality in the Father, but we find it as soon as we suppose the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. So, all are equal by reason of the Son, not as if the Son were the principle of equality in the Father, but that, without the Son equal to the Father, the Father could not be called equal; because His equality is considered firstly in regard to the Son: for that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is equal to the Father, is also from the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. Likewise, if the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, Who is the union of the two, be excluded, we cannot understand the oneness of the union between the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. So all are connected by reason of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; because given the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, we find whence the Father and the Son are said to be united.

<p>According to the third consideration, which brings before us the adequate power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the sphere of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>, there is said to be a third kind of appropriation, of "power," "wisdom," and "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>." This kind of appropriation is made both by reason of similitude as regards what <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and by reason of dissimilitude if we consider what is in creatures. For "power" has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a principle, and so it has a likeness to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">heavenly Father</a>, Who is the principle of the whole Godhead. But in an earthly father it is wanting sometimes by reason of old age. "Wisdom" has likeness to the heavenly Son, as the Word, for a word is nothing but the concept of wisdom. In an earthly son this is sometimes absent by reason of lack of years. "Goodness," as the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and object of love, has likeness to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; but seems repugnant to the earthly spirit, which often implies a certain <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> impulse, according to <a href="../bible/isa025.htm#verse4">Isaiah 25:4</a>: "The spirit of the strong is as a blast beating on the wall." "Strength" is appropriated to the Son and to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, not as denoting the power itself of a thing, but as sometimes used to express that which proceeds from power; for instance, we say that the strong work done by an agent is its strength.

<p>According to the fourth consideration, i.e. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> relation to His effects, there arise appropriation of the expression "from Whom, by Whom, and in Whom." For this preposition "from" [ex] sometimes implies a certain relation of the material <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; which has no place in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and sometimes it expresses the relation of the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, which can be applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by reason of His active power; hence it is appropriated to the Father in the same way as power. The preposition "by" [per] sometimes designates an intermediate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; thus we may say that a smith works "by" a hammer. Hence the word "by" is not always appropriated to the Son, but belongs to the Son properly and strictly, according to the text, "All things were made by Him" (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John 1:3</a>); not that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is an instrument, but as "the principle from a principle." Sometimes it designates the habitude of a form "by" which an agent works; thus we say that an artificer works by his art. Hence, as wisdom and art are appropriated to the Son, so also is the expression "by Whom." The preposition "in" strictly denotes the habitude of one containing. Now, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> contains things in two ways: in one way by their similitudes; thus things are said to be in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. In this sense the expression "in Him" should be appropriated to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. In another sense things are contained in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forasmuch as He in His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> preserves and governs them, by guiding them to a fitting end; and in this sense the expression "in Him" is appropriated to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as likewise is "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>." Nor need the habitude of the final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> (though the first of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>) be appropriated to the Father, Who is "the principle without a principle": because the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, of Whom the Father is the principle, do not proceed from Him as towards an end, since each of Them is the last end; but They proceed by a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> procession, which seems more to belong to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power.

<p>Regarding the other points of inquiry, we can say that since "<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>" belongs to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as stated above (Question 16, Article 1), it is appropriated to the Son, without, however, being a property of His. For <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> can be considered as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the thought or in the thing itself. Hence, as <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and thing in their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> meaning, are referred to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, and not to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, so the same is to be said of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. The definition quoted from <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> as appropriated to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. The "book of life" directly means <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> but indirectly it means life. For, as above explained (24, 1), it is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> regarding those who are to possess <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>. Consequently, it is appropriated to the Son; although life is appropriated to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as implying a certain kind of interior movement, agreeing in that sense with the property of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> as Love. To be written by another is not of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of a book considered as such; but this belongs to it only as a work produced. So this does not imply origin; nor is it personal, but an appropriation to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. The expression "Who is" is appropriated to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Son, not by reason of itself, but by reason of an adjunct, inasmuch as, in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> word to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, was prefigured the delivery of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> accomplished by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. Yet, forasmuch as the word "Who" is taken in a relative sense, it may sometimes relate to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Son; and in that sense it would be taken personally; as, for instance, were we to say, "The Son is the begotten 'Who is,'" inasmuch as "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> begotten is personal." But taken indefinitely, it is an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> term. And although the pronoun "this" [iste] seems grammatically to point to a particular <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, nevertheless everything that we can point to can be grammatically treated as a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, although in its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> it is not a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; as we may say, "this stone," and "this ass." So, speaking in a grammatical sense, so far as the word "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" signifies and stands for the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, the latter may be designated by the pronoun "this," according to <a href="../bible/exo015.htm#verse2">Exodus 15:2</a>: "This is my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and I will glorify Him."
