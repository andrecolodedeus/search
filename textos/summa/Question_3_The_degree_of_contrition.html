<h1>Question 3. The degree of contrition</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5003.htm#article1"> Is contrition the greatest possible sorrow in the world?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5003.htm#article2"> Can the sorrow of contrition be too great?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5003.htm#article3"> Should sorrow for one sin be greater than for another?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether contrition is the greatest possible sorrow in the world?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is not the greatest possible sorrow in the world. For sorrow is the sensation of hurt. But some hurts are more keenly felt than the hurt of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, e.g. the hurt of a wound. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is not the greatest sorrow.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, we judge of a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> according to its effect. Now the effect of sorrow is tears. Since therefore sometimes a <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> does not shed outward tears for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, whereas he weeps for the death of a friend, or for a blow, or the like, it seems that <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is not the greatest sorrow.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the more a thing is mingled with its contrary, the less its intensity. But the sorrow of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> has a considerable admixture of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> rejoices in his delivery, in the hope of pardon, and in many like things. Therefore his sorrow is very slight.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the sorrow of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is a kind of displeasure. But there are many things more displeasing to the <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a> than their past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; for they would not prefer to suffer the pains of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> rather than to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. nor to have suffered, nor yet to suffer all manner of temporal punishment; else few would be found <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a>. Therefore the sorrow of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is not the greatest.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei xiv, 7, 9), "all sorrow is based on love." Now the love of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, on which the sorrow of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is based, is the greatest love. Therefore the sorrow of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is the greatest sorrow.

<p>Further, sorrow is for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore the greater the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, the greater the sorrow. But the fault is a greater <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> than its punishment. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> which is sorrow for fault, surpasses all other sorrow.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1, 2, ad 1), there is a twofold sorrow in <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>: one is in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and is the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, being nothing else than displeasure at past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and this sorrow, in <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, surpasses all other sorrows. For the more pleasing a thing is, the more displeasing is its contrary. Now the last end is above all things pleasing: wherefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which turns us away from the last end, should be, above all things, displeasing. The other sorrow is in the sensitive part, and is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the former sorrow either from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, in so far as the lower powers follow the movements of the higher, or from choice, in so far as a penitent excites in himself this sorrow for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. In neither of these ways is such sorrow, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, the greatest, because the lower powers are more deeply moved by their own objects than through redundance from the higher powers. Wherefore the nearer the operation of the higher powers approaches to the objects of the lower powers, the more do the latter follow the movement of the former. Consequently there is greater pain in the sensitive part, on account of a sensible hurt, than that which redounds into the sensitive part from the reason; and likewise, that which redounds from the reason when it deliberates on corporeal things, is greater than that which redounds from the reason in considering <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things. Therefore the sorrow which results in the sensitive part from the reason's displeasure at <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is not greater than the other sorrows of which that same part is the subject: and likewise, neither is the sorrow which is assumed <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> greater than other sorrows--both because the lower <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> does not obey the higher <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> infallibly, as though in the lower <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> there should arise a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of such intensity and of such a kind as the higher <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> might ordain--and because the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are employed by the reason, in acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, according to a certain measure, which the sorrow that is without <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> sometimes does not observe, but exceeds.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Just as sensible sorrow is on account of the sensation of hurt, so interior sorrow is on account of the thought of something hurtful. Therefore, although the hurt of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not perceived by the external sense, yet it is perceived to be the most grievous hurt by the interior sense or reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Affections of the body are the immediate result of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and, through them, of the emotions of the higher <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Hence it is that bodily tears flow more quickly from sensible sorrow, or even from a thing that hurts the senses, than from the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> sorrow of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> which a penitent has for his sorrow does not lessen his displeasure (for it is not contrary to it), but increases it, according as every operation is increased by the delight which it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, as stated in Ethic. x, 5. Thus he who delights in learning a science, learns the better, and, in like manner, he who rejoices in his displeasure, is the more intensely displeased. But it may well happen that this <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> tempers the sorrow that results from the reason in the sensitive part.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The degree of displeasure at a thing should be proportionate to the degree of its <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is measured from Him against Whom it is committed, inasmuch as it is offensive to Him; and from him who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, inasmuch as it is hurtful to him. And, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more than himself, therefore he should <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as an offense against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, more than as being hurtful to himself. Now it is hurtful to him chiefly because it separates him from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and in this respect the separation from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> which is a punishment, should be more displeasing than the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> itself, as <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> this hurt (since what is <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> on account of something else, is less <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>), but less than the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as an offense against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Again, among all the punishments of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> a certain order is observed according to the degree of the hurt. Consequently, since this is the greatest hurt, inasmuch as it consists in privation of the greatest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, the greatest of all punishments will be separation from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>Again, with regard to this displeasure, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to observe that there is also an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> degree of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, in respect of the present and the past; since what is past, is no more, whence it has less of the character of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> or <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Hence it is that a man shrinks from suffering an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> at the present, or at some future time, more than he shudders at the past <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: wherefore also, no passion of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> corresponds directly to the past, as sorrow corresponds to present <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and fear to future <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Consequently, of two past <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> shrinks the more from that one which still produces a greater effect at the present time, or which, it <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a>, will produce a greater effect in the future, although in the past it was the lesser <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And, since the effect of the past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is sometimes not so keenly felt as the effect of the past punishment, both because <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is more perfectly remedied than punishment, and because bodily defect is more manifest than <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> defect, therefore even a man, who is well disposed, sometimes feels a greater abhorrence of his past punishment than of his past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, although he would be ready to suffer the same punishment over again rather than commit the same <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>We must also observe, in comparing <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with punishment, that some punishments are inseparable from offense of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, e.g. separation from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and some also are everlasting, e.g. the punishment of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. Therefore the punishment to which is connected offense of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is to be shunned in the same way as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; whereas that which is everlasting is simply to be shunned more than <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. If, however, we separate from these punishments the notion of offense, and consider only the notion of punishment, they have the character of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, less than <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has as an offense against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and for this reason should <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> less displeasure.

<p>We must, however, take note that, although the <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a> should be thus disposed, yet he should not be questioned about his feelings, because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot easily measure them. Sometimes that which displeases least seems to displease most, through being more closely connected with some sensible hurt, which is more <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the sorrow of contrition can be too great?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the sorrow of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> cannot be too great. For no sorrow can be more immoderate than that which destroys its own subject. But the sorrow of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, if it be so great as to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> death or corruption of the body, is praiseworthy. For <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm</a> says (Orat. lii): "Would that such were the exuberance of my inmost <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as to dry up the marrow of my body"; and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [De Contritione Cordis, work of an unknown author] confesses that "he deserves to blind his eyes with tears." Therefore the sorrow of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> cannot be too great.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the sorrow of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> results from the love of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. But the love of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> cannot be too great. Neither, therefore, can the sorrow of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> be too great.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Every moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is destroyed by excess and deficiency. But <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is an act of a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, viz. penance, since it is a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Therefore sorrow for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> can be too great.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Contrition, as regards the sorrow in the reason, i.e. the displeasure, whereby the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is displeasing through being an offense against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, cannot be too great; even as neither can the love of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> be too great, for when this is increased the aforesaid displeasure is increased also. But, as regards the sensible sorrow, <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> may be too great, even as outward affliction of the body may be too great. In all these things the rule should be the safeguarding of the subject, and of that general well-being which suffices for the fulfillment of one's duties; hence it is written (<a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse1">Romans 12:1</a>): "Let your sacrifice be reasonable [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Present your bodies . . . a reasonable sacrifice']."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm</a> desired the marrow of his body to be dried up by the exuberance of his devotion, not as regards the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> humor, but as to his bodily desires and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a>. And, although <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> acknowledged that he deserved to lose the use of his bodily eyes on account of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, because every sinner deserves not only <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, but also temporal death, yet he did not wish his eyes to be blinded.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This objection considers the sorrow which is in the reason: while the Third considers the sorrow of the sensitive part.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether sorrow for one sin should be greater than for another?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that sorrow for one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> need not be greater than for another. For <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> (Ep. cviii) commends <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> for that "she deplored her slightest <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> as much as great ones." Therefore one need not be more sorry for one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than for another.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the movement of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is instantaneous. Now one instantaneous movement cannot be at the same time more intense and more remiss. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> for one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> need not be greater than for another.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> chiefly as turning us away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But all mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> agree in turning us away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since they all deprive us of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> whereby the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore we should have equal <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> for all mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/deu025.htm#verse2">Deuteronomy 25:2</a>): "According to the measure of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, shall the measure also of the stripes be." Now, in <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, the stripes are measured according to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, because to <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is united the purpose of making satisfaction. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> should be for one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> more than for another.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be contrite for that which he ought to have avoided. But he ought to avoid one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> more than another, if that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is more grievous, and it be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to do one or the other. Therefore, in like manner, he ought to be more sorry for one, viz. the more grievous, than for the other.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We may speak of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> in two ways: first, in so far as it corresponds to each single <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and thus, as regards the sorrow in the higher <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, a man ought to be more sorry for a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because there is more reason for sorrow, viz. the offense against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in such a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than in another, since the more inordinate the act is, the more it offends <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In like manner, since the greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> deserves a greater punishment, the sorrow also of the sensitive part, in so far as it is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> undergone for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as the punishment thereof, ought to be greater where the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is greater. But in so far as the emotions of the lower <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> result from the impression of the higher <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, the degree of sorrow depends on the disposition of the lower faculty to the reception of impressions from the higher faculty, and not on the greatness of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>Secondly, <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> may be taken in so far as it is directed to all one's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> together, as in the act of <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>. Such <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> arises either from the consideration of each single <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and thus although it is but one act, yet the distinction of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> remains virtually therein; or, at least, it includes the purpose of thinking of each <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and in this way too it is <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a> more for one than for another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> is commended, not for deploring all her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> equally, but because she grieved for her slight <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> as much as though they were grave <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, in comparison with other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who grieve for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: but for graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> she would have grieved much more.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In that instantaneous movement of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, although it is not possible to find an actually distinct intensity in respect of each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, yet it is found in the way explained above; and also in another way, in so far as, in this general <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is related to that particular motive of sorrow which occurs to the <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, viz. the offense against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For he who loves a whole, loves its parts <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a> although not actually, and accordingly he loves some parts more and some less, in proportion to their relation to the whole; thus he who loves a community, virtually loves each one more or less according to their respective relations to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. In like manner he who is sorry for having offended <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, implicitly grieves for his different <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in different ways, according as by them he offended <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more or less.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although each mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> turns us away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and deprives us of His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, yet some remove us further away than others, inasmuch as through their inordinateness they become more out of harmony with the order of the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, than others do.
