<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether it is befitting for a Divine Person to assume?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is not befitting to a Divine Person to assume a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For a Divine Person signifies something most perfect. Now no addition can be made to what is perfect. Therefore, since to assume is to take to oneself, and consequently what is assumed is added to the one who assumes, it does not seem to be befitting to a Divine Person to assume a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that to which anything is assumed is communicated in some degree to what is assumed to it, just as dignity is communicated to whosoever is assumed to a dignity. But it is of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to be incommunicable, as was said above (I, 29, 1). Therefore it is not befitting to a Divine Person to assume, i.e. to take to Himself.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is constituted by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But it is repugnant that the thing constituted should assume the constituent, since the effect does not act on its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Hence it is not befitting to a Person to assume a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [Fulgentius] says (De Fide ad Petrum ii): "This <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, i.e. the only-Begotten one, took the form," i.e. the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, "of a servant to His own Person." But the only-Begotten <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a Person. Therefore it is befitting to a Person to take, i.e. to assume a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In the word "assumption" are implied two things, viz. the principle and the term of the act, for to assume is to take something to oneself. Now of this assumption a Person is both the principle and the term. The principle--because it properly belongs to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to act, and this assuming of flesh took place by the Divine action. Likewise a Person is the term of this assumption, because, as was said above (2, 1,2), the union took place in the Person, and not in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence it is plain that to assume a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is most properly befitting to a Person.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Since the Divine Person is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, no addition can be made to it: Hence Cyril says [Council of Ephesus, Part I, ch. 26]: "We do not conceive the mode of conjunction to be according to addition"; just as in the union of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nothing is added to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of adoption, but what is Divine is united to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; hence, not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> but <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is perfected.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A Divine Person is said to be incommunicable inasmuch as It cannot be predicated of several supposita, but nothing prevents several things being predicated of the Person. Hence it is not contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to be communicated so as to subsist in several <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, for even in a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> several natures may concur <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, as in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> we find <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> and <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>. But this is proper to a Divine Person, on account of its <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>, that there should be a concourse of natures in it, not <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, but in subsistence.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As was said above (Question 2, Article 1), the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> constitutes a Divine Person, not simply, but forasmuch as the Person is denominated from such a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> does not make the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> to be simply, since He was from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, but only to be <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. It is by the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> that a Divine Person is constituted simply. Hence the Divine Person is not said to assume the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, but to assume the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether it is befitting to the Divine Nature to assume?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is not befitting to the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> to assume. Because, as was said above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), to assume is to take to oneself. But the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> did not take to Itself <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, for the union did not take place in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as was said above (2, 1,3). Hence it is not befitting to the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> to assume <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> is common to the three Persons. If, therefore, it is befitting to the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> to assume, it consequently is befitting to the three Persons; and thus the Father assumed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> even as the Son, which is <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to assume is to act. But to act befits a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, not a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which is rather taken to be the principle by which the agent acts. Therefore to assume is not befitting to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Fulgentius) says (De Fide ad Petrum ii): "That <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which remains <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> begotten of the Father" (i.e. which is received from the Father by <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> generation) "took our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> free of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from His Mother."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was said above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), in the word assumption two things are signified--to wit, the principle and the term of the action. Now to be the principle of the assumption belongs to the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> in itself, because the assumption took place by Its power; but to be the term of the assumption does not belong to the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> in itself, but by reason of the Person in Whom It is considered to be. Hence a Person is primarily and more properly said to assume, but it may be said secondarily that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> assumed a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to Its Person. And after the same manner the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> is also said to be <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>, not that it is changed to flesh, but that it assumed the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of flesh. Hence <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 6): "Following the blessed <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> and Cyril we say that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> "Oneself" is reciprocal, and points to the same suppositum. But the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> is not a distinct suppositum from the Person of the Word. Hence, inasmuch as the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> took <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to the Person of the Word, It is said to take it to Itself. But although the Father takes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to the Person of the Word, He did not thereby take it to Himself, for the suppositum of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is not one. and hence it cannot properly be said that the Father assumes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> What is befitting to the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> in Itself is befitting to the three Persons, as <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, wisdom, and the like. But to assume belongs to It by reason of the Person of the Word, as was said above, and hence it is befitting to that Person alone.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "what is" and "whereby it is" are the same, so likewise in Him "what acts" and "whereby it acts" are the same, since everything acts, inasmuch as it is a being. Hence the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> is both that whereby <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> acts, and the very <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who acts.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the Nature abstracted from the Personality can assume?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that if we abstract the Personality by our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> cannot assume. For it was said above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>) that it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> to assume by reason of the Person. But what belongs to one by reason of another cannot belong to it if the other is removed; as a body, which is visible by reason of color, without color cannot be seen. Hence if the Personality be <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mentally</a> abstracted, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> cannot assume.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, assumption implies the term of union, as was said above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). But the union cannot take place in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but only in the Person. Therefore, if the Personality be abstracted, the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> cannot assume.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it has been said above (I, 40, 3) that in the Godhead if the Personality is abstracted, nothing remains. But the one who assumes is something. Therefore, if the Personality is abstracted, the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> cannot assume.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> In the Godhead Personality signifies a personal property; and this is threefold, viz. Paternity, Filiation and Procession, as was said above (I, 30, 2). Now if we <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mentally</a> abstract these, there still remains the omnipotence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by which the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> was wrought, as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> says (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse37">Luke 1:37</a>): "No word shall be impossible with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore it seems that if the Personality be removed, the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> can still assume.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> stands in two ways towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. First, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as He is, and in this manner it is impossible for the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to circumscribe something in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and leave the rest, for all that is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is one, except the distinction of Persons; and as regards these, if one is removed the other is taken away, since they are distinguished by relations only which must be together at the same time. Secondly, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> stands towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not indeed as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as He is, but in its own way, i.e. understanding manifoldly and separately what in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is one: and in this way our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can understand the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and wisdom, and the like, which are called <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> attributes, without understanding Paternity or Filiation, which are called Personalities. And hence if we abstract Personality by our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, we may still understand the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> assuming.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Because in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "what is," and "whereby it is," are one, if any one of the things which are attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the abstract is considered in itself, abstracted from all else, it will still be something subsisting, and consequently a Person, since it is an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence just as we now say three Persons, on account of holding three personal properties, so likewise if we <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mentally</a> exclude the personal properties there will still remain in our thought the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> as subsisting and as a Person. And in this way It may be understood to assume <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> by reason of Its subsistence or Personality.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Even if the personal properties of the three Persons are abstracted by our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, nevertheless there will remain in our thoughts the one Personality of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> consider. And the assumption can be terminated in It, as we now say it is terminated in the Person of the Word.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If we <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mentally</a> abstract the Personality, it is said that nothing remains by way of resolution, i.e. as if the subject of the relation and the relation itself were distinct because all we can think of in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is considered as a subsisting suppositum. However, some of the things predicated of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can be understood without others, not by way of resolution, but by the way mentioned above.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether one Person without another can assume a created nature?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one Person cannot assume a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> without another assuming it. For "the works of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> are inseparable," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion xxxviii). But as the three Persons have one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, so likewise They have one operation. Now to assume is an operation. Therefore it cannot belong to one without belonging to another.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as we say the Person of the Son became <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>, so also did the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>; for "the whole Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> became <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a> in one of Its hypostases," as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 6). But the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> is common to the three Persons. Therefore the assumption is.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is assumed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so likewise are men assumed by Him through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse3">Romans 14:3</a>: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath taken him to Him." But this assumption pertains to all the Persons; therefore the first also.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. ii) that the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> pertains to "discrete <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>," i.e. according to which something "distinct" is said of the Divine Persons.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was said above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), assumption implies two things, viz. the act of assuming and the term of assumption. Now the act of assumption proceeds from the Divine power, which is common to the three Persons, but the term of the assumption is a Person, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Hence what has to do with action in the assumption is common to the three Persons; but what pertains to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of term belongs to one Person in such a manner as not to belong to another; for the three Persons <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to be united to the one Person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This reason regards the operation, and the conclusion would follow if it implied this operation only, without the term, which is a Person.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> is said to be <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>, and to assume by reason of the Person in Whom the union is terminated, as stated above (1,2), and not as it is common to the three Persons. Now "the whole Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> is" said to be "<a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>"; not that It is <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a> in all the Persons, but inasmuch as nothing is wanting to the perfection of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> of the Person <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> explains there.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The assumption which takes place by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of adoption is terminated in a certain participation of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, by an assimilation to Its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, according to <a href="../bible/2pe001.htm#verse4">2 Peter 1:4</a>: "That you may be made partakers of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>"; and hence this assumption is common to the three Persons, in regard to the principle and the term. But the assumption which is by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of union is common on the part of the principle, but not on the part of the term, as was said above.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether each of the Divine Persons could have assumed human nature?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that no other Divine Person could have assumed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> except the Person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. For by this assumption it has been brought about that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>. But it was not becoming that either the Father or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> should be said to be a Son; for this would tend to the confusion of the Divine Persons. Therefore the Father and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> could not have assumed flesh.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, by the Divine <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> men have come into possession of the adoption of sons, according to <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse15">Romans 8:15</a>: "For you have not received the spirit of bondage again in fear, but the spirit of adoption of sons." But sonship by adoption is a participated likeness of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> sonship which does not belong to the Father nor the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; hence it is said (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse29">Romans 8:29</a>): "For whom He foreknew He also <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to be made conformable to the image of His Son." Therefore it seems that no other Person except the Person of the Son could have become <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is said to be sent and to be begotten by the temporal nativity, inasmuch as He became <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>. But it does not belong to the Father to be sent, for He is innascible, as was said above (I, 32, 3; I, 43, 4). Therefore at least the Person of the Father cannot become <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Whatever the Son can do, so can the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, otherwise the power of the three Persons would not be one. But the Son was able to become <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>. Therefore the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> were able to become <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was said above (1,2,4), assumption implies two things, viz. the act of the one assuming and the term of the assumption. Now the principle of the act is the Divine power, and the term is a Person. But the Divine power is indifferently and commonly in all the Persons. Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of Personality is common to all the Persons, although the personal properties are different. Now whenever a power regards several things indifferently, it can terminate its action in any of them indifferently, as is plain in rational powers, which regard opposites, and can do either of them. Therefore the Divine power could have united <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to the Person of the Father or of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as It united it to the Person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. And hence we must say that the Father or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> could have assumed flesh even as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The temporal sonship, whereby <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is said to be the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, does not constitute His Person, as does the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Sonship; but is something following upon the temporal nativity. Hence, if the name of son were transferred to the Father or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> in this manner, there would be no confusion of the Divine Persons.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Adoptive sonship is a certain participation of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> sonship; but it takes place in us, by appropriation, by the Father, Who is the principle of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> sonship, and by the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, Who is the love of the Father and Son, according to <a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse6">Galatians 4:6</a>: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath sent the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of His Son into your hearts crying, <a href="../cathen/01006d.htm">Abba</a>, Father." And therefore, even as by <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> of the Son we receive adoptive sonship in the likeness of His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> sonship, so likewise, had the Father become <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>, we should have received adoptive sonship from Him, as from the principle of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> sonship, and from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> as from the common bond of Father and Son.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It belongs to the Father to be innascible as to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> birth, and the temporal birth would not destroy this. But the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is said to be sent in regard to <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, inasmuch as He is from another, without which <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> would not suffice for the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of mission.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether several Divine Persons can assume one and the same individual nature?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that two Divine Persons cannot assume one and the same <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For, this being granted, there would either be several men or one. But not several, for just as one Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> in several Persons does not make several gods, so one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in several <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> does not make several men. Nor would there be only one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, for one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is "this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," which signifies one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; and hence the distinction of three Divine Persons would be destroyed, which cannot be allowed. Therefore neither two nor three Persons can take one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the assumption is terminated in the unity of Person, as has been said above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). But the Father, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are not one Person. Therefore the three Persons cannot assume one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 3,4), and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. i, 11,12,13), that from <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Son it follows that whatever is said of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is said of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, and conversely. Hence, if three Persons were to assume one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it would follow that whatever is said of each of the three Persons would be said of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; and conversely, what was said of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> could be said of each of the three Persons. Therefore what is proper to the Father, viz. to beget the Son, would be said of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and consequently would be said of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; and this could not be. Therefore it is impossible that the three Persons should assume one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The Incarnate Person subsists in two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>. But the three Persons can subsist in one Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>. Therefore they can also subsist in one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in such a way that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> be assumed by the three Persons.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was said above (2, 5, ad 1), by the union of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> neither a new <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is made nor a new hypostasis, but one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is assumed to the Divine Person or hypostasis, which, indeed, does not take place by the power of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but by the power of the Divine Person. Now such is the characteristic of the Divine Persons that one does not exclude another from communicating in the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but only in the same Person. Hence, since in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> "the whole reason of the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> is the power of the doer," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. ad Volusianum cxxxvii), we must judge of it in regard to the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of the Divine Person assuming, and not according to the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> assumed. Therefore it is not impossible that two or three Divine Persons should assume one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but it would be impossible for them to assume one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> hypostasis or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; thus <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm</a> says in the book De Concep. Virg. (Cur Deus Homo ii, 9), that "several Persons cannot assume one and the same <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to unity of Person."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In the hypothesis that three Persons assume one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it would be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to say that the three Persons were one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, because of the one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For just as it is now <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to say the three Persons are one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on account of the one Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, so it would be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to say they are one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> on account of the one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Nor would "one" imply unity of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, but unity in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; for it could not be argued that because the three Persons were one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> they were one simply. For nothing hinders our saying that men, who are many simply, are in some respect one, e.g. one people, and as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. vi, 3): "The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> and the spirit of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> are by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> different, but by inherence one spirit results," according to <a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse17">1 Corinthians 6:17</a>: "He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In this supposition the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> would be assumed to the unity, not indeed of one Person, but to the unity of each Person, so that even as the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> unity with each Person, so also the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> would have a unity with each Person by assumption.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, there results a communication of the properties belonging to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, because whatever belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> can be predicated of the Person subsisting in that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, no <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to which of the natures it may apply. Hence in this hypothesis, of the Person of the Father may be predicated what belongs to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and what belongs to the Divine; and likewise of the Person of the Son and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. But what belongs to the Person of the Father by reason of His own Person could not be attributed to the Person of the Son or <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> on account of the distinction of Persons which would still remain. Therefore it might be said that as the Father was unbegotten, so the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was unbegotten, inasmuch as "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" stood for the Person of the Father. But if one were to go on to say, "The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is unbegotten; the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; therefore the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is unbegotten," it would be the fallacy of figure of speech or of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>; even as we now say <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is unbegotten, because the Father is unbegotten, yet we cannot conclude that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is unbegotten, although He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether one Divine Person can assume two human natures?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one Divine Person cannot assume two <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> assumed in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> has no other suppositum than the suppositum of the Divine Person, as is plain from what has been stated above (2, 3,6). Therefore, if we suppose one Person to assume two <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, there would be one suppositum of two natures of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; which would seem to imply a contradiction, for the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is only multiplied by distinct supposita.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in this hypothesis it could not be said that the Divine Person <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a> was one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, seeing that He would not have one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; neither could it be said that there were several, for several men have distinct supposita, whereas in this case there would be only one suppositum. Therefore the aforesaid hypothesis is impossible.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> the whole Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> is united to the whole <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> assumed, i.e. to every part of it, for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is "perfect <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and perfect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, complete <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and complete <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 7). But two <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> natures cannot be wholly united together, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of one would be united to the body of the other; and, again, two bodies would be together, which would give rise to confusion of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>. Therefore it is not possibly for one Divine Person to assume two <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Whatever the Father can do, that also can the Son do. But after <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> the Father can still assume a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> distinct from that which the Son has assumed; for in nothing is the power of the Father or the Son lessened by <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. Therefore it seems that after <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> the Son can assume another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> distinct from the one He has assumed.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> What has power for one thing, and no more, has a power limited to one. Now the power of a Divine Person is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, nor can it be limited by any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> thing. Hence it may not be said that a Divine Person so assumed one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as to be unable to assume another. For it would seem to follow from this that the Personality of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> was so comprehended by one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as to be unable to assume another to its Personality; and this is impossible, for the Uncreated cannot be comprehended by any creature. Hence it is plain that, whether we consider the Divine Person in regard to His power, which is the principle of the union, or in regard to His Personality, which is the term of the union, it has to be said that the Divine Person, over and beyond the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which He has assumed, can assume another distinct <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is completed in its essentials by its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, which is multiplied according to the division of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. And hence, if the composition of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> constitutes a new suppositum, the consequence is that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is multiplied by the multiplication of supposita. But in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> the union of form and <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, i.e. of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, does not constitute a new suppositum, as was said above (<a href="#6">Article 6</a>). Hence there can be a numerical multitude on the part of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, on account of the division of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, without distinction of supposita.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It might seem possible to reply that in such a hypothesis it would follow that there were two men by reason of the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, just as, on the contrary, the three Persons would be called one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, on account of the one <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> assumed, as was said above (6, ad 1). But this does not seem to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; because we must use words according to the purpose of their signification, which is in relation to our surroundings. Consequently, in order to judge of a word's signification or co-signification, we must consider the things which are around us, in which a word derived from some form is never used in the plural unless there are several supposita. For a man who has on two garments is not said to be "two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> clothed," but "one clothed with two garments"; and whoever has two <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> is designated in the singular as "such by reason of the two <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>." Now the assumed <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is, as it were, a garment, although this similitude does not fit at all points, as has been said above (2, 6, ad 1). And hence, if the Divine Person were to assume two <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, He would be called, on account of the unity of suppositum, one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> having two <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>. Now many men are said to be one people, inasmuch as they have some one thing in common, and not on account of the unity of suppositum. So likewise, if two Divine Persons were to assume one singular <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, they would be said to be one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as stated (6, ad 1), not from the unity of suppositum, but because they have some one thing in common.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The Divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> natures do not bear the same relation to the one Divine Person, but the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> is related first of all thereto, inasmuch as It is one with It from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>; and afterwards the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is related to the Divine Person, inasmuch as it is assumed by the Divine Person in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, not indeed that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is the Person, but that the Person of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> subsists in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is His Godhead, but is not His manhood. And hence, in order that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> may be assumed by the Divine Person, the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> must be united by a personal union with the whole <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> assumed, i.e. in all its parts. Now in the two natures assumed there would be a uniform relation to the Divine Person, nor would one assume the other. Hence it would not be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for one of them to be altogether united to the other, i.e. all the parts of one with all the parts of the other.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether it was more fitting that the Person of the Son rather than any other Divine Person should assume human nature?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it was not more fitting that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> should become <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a> than the Father or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. For by the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> men are led to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse37">John 18:37</a>: "For this was I born, and for this came I into the world, to give testimony to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." But by the Person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> becoming <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a> many have been kept back from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since they referred to the very Person of the Son what was said of the Son in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, who held an inequality of Persons, according to what is said (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse28">John 14:28</a>): "The Father is greater than I." Now this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> would not have arisen if the Person of the Father had become <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>, for no one would have taken the Father to be less than the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. Hence it seems fitting that the Person of the Father, rather than the Person of the Son, should have become <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the effect of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> would seem to be, as it were, a second creation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, according to <a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse15">Galatians 6:15</a>: "For in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a> neither <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature." But the power of creation is appropriated to the Father. Therefore it would have been more becoming to the Father than to the Son to become <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> is ordained to the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse21">Matthew 1:21</a>: "Thou shalt call His name <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">Jesus</a>. For He shall save His people from their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." Now the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is attributed to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> according to <a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse22">John 20:22-23:</a> "Receive ye the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> you shall forgive, they are forgiven them." Therefore it became the Person of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> rather than the Person of the Son to become <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 1): "In the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> the wisdom and power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>: the wisdom, for He found a most suitable discharge for a most heavy debt; the power, for He made the conquered conquer." But power and wisdom are appropriated to the Son, according to <a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse24">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>: "Christ, the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore it was fitting that the Person of the Son should become <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It was most fitting that the Person of the Son should become incarnate. First, on the part of the union; for such as are similar are fittingly united. Now the Person of the Son, Who is the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, has a certain common agreement with all creatures, because the word of the craftsman, i.e. his concept, is an exemplar likeness of whatever is made by him. Hence the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, Who is His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> concept, is the exemplar likeness of all creatures. And therefore as creatures are established in their proper <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, though movably, by the participation of this likeness, so by the non-participated and personal union of the Word with a creature, it was fitting that the creature should be restored in order to its <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and unchangeable perfection; for the craftsman by the intelligible form of his art, whereby he fashioned his handiwork, restores it when it has fallen into ruin. Moreover, He has a particular agreement with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, since the Word is a concept of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Wisdom, from Whom all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> wisdom is derived. And hence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is perfected in wisdom (which is his proper perfection, as he is rational) by participating the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, as the disciple is instructed by receiving the word of his master. Hence it is said (<a href="../bible/sir001.htm#verse5">Sirach 1:5</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> on high is the fountain of wisdom." And hence for the consummate perfection of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> it was fitting that the very <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> should be personally united to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p>Secondly, the reason of this fitness may be taken from the end of the union, which is the fulfilling of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, i.e. of such as are preordained to the heavenly inheritance, which is bestowed only on sons, according to <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse17">Romans 8:17</a>: "If sons, heirs also." Hence it was fitting that by Him Who is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> Son, men should share this likeness of sonship by adoption, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says in the same chapter (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse29">Romans 8:29</a>): "For whom He foreknew, He also <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to be made conformable to the image of His Son."

<p>Thirdly, the reason for this fitness may be taken from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a>, for which <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> supplied the remedy. For the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> by seeking <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, as is plain from the words of the serpent, promising to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Hence it was fitting that by the Word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> might be led back to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, having wandered from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through an inordinate thirst for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> There is nothing which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> cannot abuse, since it even abuses <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse4">Romans 2:4</a>: "Or despisest thou the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> of His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>?" Hence, even if the Person of the Father had become <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>, men would have been capable of finding an occasion of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, as though the Son were not able to restore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The first creation of things was made by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father through the Word; hence the second creation ought to have been brought about through the Word, by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father, in order that restoration should correspond to creation according to <a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse19">2 Corinthians 5:19</a>: "For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> indeed was in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> reconciling the world to Himself."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> To be the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is proper to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. But the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as by the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And hence it was more fitting to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> justification that the Son should become <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>, Whose <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is.
