<h1>Question 3. The outward act of faith</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3003.htm#article1"> Is confession an act of faith?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3003.htm#article2"> Is confession of faith necessary for salvation?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether confession is an act of faith?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that confession is not an act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For the same act does not belong to different <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Now confession belongs to penance of which it is a part. Therefore it is not an act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is sometimes deterred by fear or some kind of confusion, from confessing his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse19">Ephesians 6:19</a>) asks for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> that it may be granted him "with confidence, to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the gospel." Now it belongs to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, which moderates daring and fear, not to be deterred from doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> on account of confusion or fear. Therefore it seems that confession is not an act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but rather of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> or constancy.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as the ardor of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> makes one confess one's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> outwardly, so does it make one do other external <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works, for it is written (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse6">Galatians 5:6</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> . . . worketh by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>." But other external works are not reckoned acts of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Therefore neither is confession an act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> explains the words of <a href="../bible/2th001.htm#verse11">2 Thessalonians 1:11</a>, "and the work of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in power" as referring to "confession which is a work proper to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Outward actions belong properly to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to whose end they are specifically referred: thus <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> is referred specifically to the end of abstinence, which is to tame the flesh, and consequently it is an act of abstinence.

<p>Now confession of those things that are of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is referred specifically as to its end, to that which concerns <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, according to <a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse13">2 Corinthians 4:13</a>: "Having the same spirit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> . . . we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and therefore we speak also." For the outward utterance is intended to signify the inward thought. Wherefore, just as the inward thought of matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is properly an act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so too is the outward confession of them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A threefold confession is commended by the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. One is the confession of matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and this is a proper act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, since it is referred to the end of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as stated above. Another is the confession of thanksgiving or praise, and this is an act of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>," for its purpose is to give outward <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is the end of "<a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>." The third is the confession of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which is ordained to the blotting out of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which is the end of penance, to which <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> it therefore belongs.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> That which removes an obstacle is not a direct, but an indirect, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proves (Phys. viii, 4). Hence <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> which removes an obstacle to the confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, viz. fear or shame, is not the proper and direct <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of confession, but an indirect <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> so to speak.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Inward <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, with the aid of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> all outward acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, by means of the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, commanding, but not eliciting them; whereas it produces the act of confession as its proper act, without the help of any other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether confession of faith is necessary for salvation?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For, seemingly, a thing is sufficient for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, if it is a means of attaining the end of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now the proper end of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the union of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind with Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and this can be realized without any outward confession. Therefore confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, by outward confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, a man reveals his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But this is unnecessary save for those who have to instruct others in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Therefore it seems that the simple folk are not bound to confess the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whatever may tend to <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalize</a> and disturb others, is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse32">1 Corinthians 10:32</a>): "Be without offense to the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> and to the gentiles and to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Now confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> sometimes <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a disturbance among unbelievers. Therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse10">Romans 10:10</a>): "With the heart we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> unto <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; but with the mouth, confession is made unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Things that are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> come under the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>. Now since confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is something affirmative, it can only fall under an affirmative precept. Hence its <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> depends on how it falls under an affirmative precept of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>. Now affirmative precepts as stated above (I-II, 71, 5, ad 3; I-II, 88, 1, ad 2) do not bind for always, although they are always binding; but they bind as to place and time according to other due circumstances, in respect of which <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> have to be regulated in order to be acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p>Thus then it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to confess one's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> at all times and in all places, but in certain places and at certain times, when, namely, by omitting to do so, we would deprive <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of due <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, or our neighbor of a service that we ought to render him: for instance, if a man, on being asked about his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, were to remain silent, so as to make people <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> either that he is without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or that the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, or so as to turn others away from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; for in such cases as these, confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The end of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, even as of the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, must be referred to the end of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which is the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and our neighbor. Consequently when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and our neighbor's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> demand, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should not be contented with being united by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but ought to confess his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> outwardly.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In cases of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> where <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is in danger, every one is bound to proclaim his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to others, either to give <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> example and encouragement to the rest of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, or to check the attacks of unbelievers: but at other times it is not the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to instruct others in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There is nothing commendable in making a public confession of one's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, if it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a disturbance among unbelievers, without any profit either to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or to the faithful. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse6">Matthew 7:6</a>): "Give not that which is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> to dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine . . . lest turning upon you, they tear you." Yet, if there is hope of profit to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or if there be urgency, a man should disregard the disturbance of unbelievers, and confess his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in public. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/mat015.htm">Matthew 15:12</a>) that when the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> had said to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> that "the Pharisee, when they heard this word, were <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a>," He answered: "Let them alone, they are blind, and leaders of the blind."
