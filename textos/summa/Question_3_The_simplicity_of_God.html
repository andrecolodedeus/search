<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether God is a body?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a body. For a body is that which has the three dimensions. But <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Scripture</a> attributes the three dimensions to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for it is written: "He is higher than <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, and what wilt thou do? He is deeper than <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">Hell</a>, and how wilt thou <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>? The measure of Him is longer than the earth and broader than the sea" (<a href="../bible/job011.htm#verse8">Job 11:8-9</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a body.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, everything that has figure is a body, since figure is a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> seems to have figure, for it is written: "Let us make <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to our image and likeness" (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis 1:26</a>). Now a figure is called an image, according to the text: "Who being the brightness of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and the figure," i.e. the image, "of His <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>" (<a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse3">Hebrews 1:3</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a body.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whatever has corporeal parts is a body. Now <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> attributes corporeal parts to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. "Hast thou an arm like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>?" (<a href="../bible/job040.htm#verse4">Job 40:4</a>); and "The eyes of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> are upon the just" (<a href="../bible/psa033.htm#verse16">Psalm 33:16</a>); and "The right hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath wrought strength" (<a href="../bible/psa117.htm#verse16">Psalm 117:16</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a body.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, posture belongs only to bodies. But something which supposes posture is said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>: "I saw the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> sitting" (<a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse1">Isaiah 6:1</a>), and "He standeth up to <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judge</a>" (<a href="../bible/isa003.htm#verse13">Isaiah 3:13</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a body.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, only bodies or things corporeal can be a local term "wherefrom" or "whereto." But in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is spoken of as a local term "whereto," according to the words, "Come ye to Him and be enlightened" (<a href="../bible/psa033.htm#verse6">Psalm 33:6</a>), and as a term "wherefrom": "All they that depart from Thee shall be written in the earth" (<a href="../bible/jer017.htm#verse13">Jeremiah 17:13</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a body.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written in the <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">Gospel of St. John</a> (<a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse24">John 4:24</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is absolutely <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not a body; and this can be shown in three ways.

<p>First, because no body is in motion unless it be put in motion, as is evident from induction. Now it has been already <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> (2, 3), that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the First Mover, and is Himself unmoved. Therefore it is clear that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not a body.

<p>Secondly, because the first being must of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> be in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">act</a>, and in no way in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. For although in any single thing that passes from <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> is prior in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a>; nevertheless, absolutely speaking, <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a> is prior to <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>; for whatever is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> can be reduced into <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a> only by some being in <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a>. Now it has been already <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the First Being. It is therefore impossible that in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there should be any <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. But every body is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> because the continuous, as such, is divisible to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>; it is therefore impossible that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should be a body.

<p>Thirdly, because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the most noble of beings. Now it is impossible for a body to be the most noble of beings; for a body must be either animate or inanimate; and an animate body is manifestly nobler than any inanimate body. But an animate body is not animate precisely as body; otherwise all bodies would be animate. Therefore its animation depends upon some other thing, as our body depends for its animation on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Hence that by which a body becomes animated must be nobler than the body. Therefore it is impossible that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should be a body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As we have said above (<a href="../summa/1001.htm#article9">Question 1, Article 9</a>), <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> puts before us <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">divine</a> things under the comparison of corporeal things. Hence, when it attributes to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the three dimensions under the comparison of corporeal <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, it implies His virtual <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>; thus, by depth, it signifies His power of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> hidden things; by height, the transcendence of His excelling power; by length, the duration of His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; by breadth, His act of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for all. Or, as says <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. ix), by the depth of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is meant the incomprehensibility of His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; by length, the procession of His all-pervading power; by breadth, His overspreading all things, inasmuch as all things lie under His protection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> is said to be after the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not as regards his body, but as regards that whereby he excels other animals. Hence, when it is said, "Let us make <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to our image and likeness", it is added, "And let him have dominion over the fishes of the sea" (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis 1:26</a>). Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> excels all animals by his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>; hence it is according to his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> and <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, which are incorporeal, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is said to be according to the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Corporeal parts are attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> on account of His actions, and this is owing to a certain parallel. For instance the act of the eye is to see; hence the eye attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> signifies His power of seeing <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectually</a>, not sensibly; and so on with the other parts.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Whatever pertains to posture, also, is only attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by some sort of parallel. He is spoken of as sitting, on account of His unchangeableness and dominion; and as standing, on account of His power of overcoming whatever withstands Him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> We draw near to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by no corporeal steps, since He is everywhere, but by the affections of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and by the actions of that same <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> do we withdraw from Him; thus, to draw near to or to withdraw signifies merely <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> actions based on the metaphor of local motion.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether God is composed of matter and form?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. For whatever has a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>; since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> of the body. But <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> attributes a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for it is mentioned in <a href="../cathen/07181a.htm">Hebrews</a> (<a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse38">Hebrews 10:38</a>), where <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> says: "But My just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> liveth by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; but if he withdraw himself, he shall not please My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and the like are <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the composite. But these are attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was exceeding <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with His people" (<a href="../bible/psa105.htm#verse40">Psalm 105:40</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is the principle of individualization. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> seems to be individual, for He cannot be predicated of many. Therefore He is composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Whatever is composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> is a body; for dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> is the first property of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not a body as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in the <a href="../summa/1003.htm#article1">preceding Article</a>; therefore He is not composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is impossible that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> should <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>First, because <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. But we have shown (<a href="../summa/1002.htm#article3">I:2:3</a>) that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/01125b.htm">pure act</a>, without any <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. Hence it is impossible that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should be composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>.

<p>Secondly, because everything composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> owes its perfection and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> to its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>; therefore its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is participated, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> participates the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Now the first <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and the best--viz. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>--is not a participated <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is prior to the participated <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Hence it is impossible that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should be composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>.

<p>Thirdly, because every agent acts by its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>; hence the manner in which it has its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> is the manner in which it is an agent. Therefore whatever is primarily and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> an agent must be primarily and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the first agent, since He is the first efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. He is therefore of His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> a <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>; and not composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> because His acts resemble the acts of a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; for, that we <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> anything, is due to our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Hence what is pleasing to His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is said to be pleasing to His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">Anger</a> and the like are attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on account of a similitude of effect. Thus, because to punish is properly the act of an <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> punishment is metaphorically spoken of as His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">Forms</a> which can be received in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> are individualized by <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, which cannot be in another as in a subject since it is the first underlying subject; although <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> of itself, unless something else prevents it, can be received by many. But that <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> which cannot be received in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but is self-subsisting, is individualized precisely because it cannot be received in a subject; and such a <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence it does not follow that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether God is the same as His essence or nature?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the same as His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> or <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For nothing can be in itself. But the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> or <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>--i.e. the Godhead--is said to be in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the same as His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> or <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the effect is assimilated to its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; for every agent produces its like. But in <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things the "suppositum" is not identical with its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; for a man is not the same as his humanity. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the same as His Godhead.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that He is <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> itself, and not only that He is a living thing: "I am the way, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>" (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John 14:6</a>). Now the relation between Godhead and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the same as the relation between <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> and a living thing. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is His very Godhead.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the same as His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> or <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. To understand this, it must be noted that in things composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> must differ from the "suppositum," because the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> or <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> connotes only what is included in the definition of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; as, <em>humanity</em> connotes all that is included in the definition of <em>man</em>, for it is by this that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and it is this that humanity signifies, that, namely, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Now individual <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, with all the individualizing <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, is not included in the definition of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. For this particular flesh, these bones, this blackness or whiteness, etc., are not included in the definition of a man. Therefore this flesh, these bones, and the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> distinguishing this particular <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, are not included in humanity; and yet they are included in the thing which is man. Hence the thing which is a man has something more in it than has humanity. Consequently humanity and a man are not wholly identical; but humanity is taken to mean the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">formal</a> part of a man, because the principles whereby a thing is defined are regarded as the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">formal</a> constituent in regard to the individualizing <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. On the other hand, in things not composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, in which individualization is not due to individual <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>--that is to say, to "this" <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>--the very <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">forms</a> being individualized of themselves--it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">forms</a> themselves should be subsisting "supposita." Therefore "suppositum" and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in them are identified. Since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> then is not composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, He must be His own Godhead, His own Life, and whatever else is thus predicated of Him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> We can speak of simple things only as though they were like the composite things from which we derive our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Therefore in speaking of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we use concrete nouns to signify His subsistence, because with us only those things subsist which are composite; and we use abstract nouns to signify His simplicity. In saying therefore that Godhead, or life, or the like are in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we indicate the composite way in which our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands, but not that there is any composition in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The effects of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> do not imitate Him perfectly, but only as far as they are able; and the imitation is here defective, precisely because what is simple and one, can only be represented by divers things; consequently, composition is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to them, and therefore, in them "suppositum" is not the same as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether essence and existence are the same in God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> are not the same in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For if it be so, then the divine being has nothing added to it. Now being to which no addition is made is universal being which is predicated of all things. Therefore it follows that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is being in general which can be predicated of everything. But this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>: "For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> gave the incommunicable name to stones and wood" (<a href="../bible/wis014.htm#verse21">Wisdom 14:21</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is not His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, we can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> "whether" <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">God exists</a> as said above (<a href="../summa/1002.htm#article2">I:2:2</a>); but we cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> "what" He is. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is not the same as His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>--that is, as His quiddity or <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (Trin. vii): "In <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is not an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, but subsisting <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." Therefore what subsists in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not only His own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, as shown in the preceding article, but also His own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. This may be shown in several ways.

<p>First, whatever a thing has besides its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> must be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> either by the constituent principles of that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> (like a property that necessarily accompanies the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>--as the faculty of laughing is proper to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>--and is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the constituent principles of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>), or by some exterior agent--as heat is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in water by fire. Therefore, if the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of a thing differs from its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, this <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> must be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> either by some exterior agent or by its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> principles. Now it is impossible for a thing's <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> to be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by its essential constituent principles, for nothing can be the sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of its own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, if its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a>. Therefore that thing, whose <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> differs from its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, must have its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by another. But this cannot be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; because we call <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the first efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Therefore it is impossible that in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> should differ from His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p>Secondly, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is that which makes every <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> or <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> actual; for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and humanity are spoken of as actual, only because they are spoken of as existing. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> must be compared to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, if the latter is a distinct reality, as <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a> to <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. Therefore, since in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is no <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, as shown above (<a href="../summa/1003.htm#article1">Article 1</a>), it follows that in Him <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> does not differ from <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. Therefore His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>.

<p>Thirdly, because, just as that which has fire, but is not itself fire, is on fire by participation; so that which has <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> but is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, is a being by participation. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is His own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, as shown above (<a href="../summa/1003.htm#article3">Article 3</a>) if, therefore, He is not His own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> He will be not essential, but participated being. He will not therefore be the first being--which is absurd. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is His own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and not merely His own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A thing that has nothing added to it can be of two kinds. Either its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> precludes any addition; thus, for example, it is of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of an irrational animal to be without reason. Or we may understand a thing to have nothing added to it, inasmuch as its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> does not require that anything should be added to it; thus the genus animal is without <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, because it is not of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of animal in general to have <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>; but neither is it to lack <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. And so the divine being has nothing added to it in the first sense; whereas universal being has nothing added to it in the second sense.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> "To be" can mean either of two things. It may mean the act of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, or it may mean the composition of a proposition effected by the mind in joining a predicate to a subject. Taking "to be" in the first sense, we cannot understand <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> nor His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; but only in the second sense. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this proposition which we form about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> when we say "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is," is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; and this we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from His effects (<a href="../summa/1002.htm#article2">I:2:2</a>).

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether God is contained in a genus?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is contained in a genus. For a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is a being that subsists of itself. But this is especially <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in a genus of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, nothing can be measured save by something of its own genus; as length is measured by length and numbers by number. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the measure of all <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Commentator</a> shows (Metaph. x). Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in the genus of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, genus is prior to what it contains. But nothing is prior to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> either really or <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mentally</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not in any genus.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing can be in a genus in two ways; either absolutely and properly, as a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> contained under a genus; or as being reducible to it, as principles and privations. For example, a point and unity are reduced to the genus of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, as its principles; while blindness and all other privations are reduced to the genus of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. But in neither way is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a genus. That He cannot be a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of any genus may be shown in three ways.

<p>First, because a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is constituted of genus and difference. Now that from which the difference constituting the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is derived, is always related to that from which the genus is derived, as <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a> is related to <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. For animal is derived from sensitive <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, by concretion as it were, for that is animal, which has a sensitive <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Rational being, on the other hand, is derived from <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, because that is rational, which has an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> is compared to sense, as <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a> is to <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. The same argument holds good in other things. Hence since in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a> is not added to <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, it is impossible that He should be in any genus as a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p>Secondly, since the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a> is His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> were in any genus, He would be the genus "being", because, since genus is predicated as an essential it refers to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of a thing. But the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> has shown (Metaph. iii) that being cannot be a genus, for every genus has differences distinct from its generic <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Now no difference can exist distinct from being; for non-being cannot be a difference. It follows then that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not in a genus.

<p>Thirdly, because all in one genus agree in the quiddity or <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the genus which is predicated of them as an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a>, but they differ in their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and of horse is not the same; as also of this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: thus in every member of a genus, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> and quiddity--i.e. <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>--must differ. But in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> they do not differ, as shown in the preceding article. Therefore it is plain that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not in a genus as if He were a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. From this it is also plain that He has no genus nor difference, nor can there be any definition of Him; nor, save through His effects, a demonstration of Him: for a definition is from genus and difference; and the mean of a demonstration is a definition. That <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not in a genus, as reducible to it as its principle, is clear from this, that a principle reducible to any genus does not extend beyond that genus; as, a point is the principle of continuous <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> alone; and unity, of discontinuous <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the principle of all being. Therefore He is not contained in any genus as its principle.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The word <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> signifies not only what <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> of itself--for <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> cannot of itself be a genus, as shown in the body of the article; but, it also signifies an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> that has the property of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in this way--namely, of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> of itself; this <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, however, is not its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Thus it is clear that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not in the genus of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This objection turns upon proportionate measure which must be homogeneous with what is measured. Now, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not a measure proportionate to anything. Still, He is called the measure of all things, in the sense that everything has being only according as it resembles Him.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether in God there are any accidents?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that there are <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> cannot be an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, as <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> says (Phys. i). Therefore that which is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> in one, cannot, in another, be a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Thus it is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that heat cannot be the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form of fire, because it is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> in other things. But wisdom, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and the like, which are <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> in us, are <a href="../cathen/06612a.htm">attributes of God</a>. Therefore in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there are <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in every genus there is a first principle. But there are many "genera" of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>. If, therefore, the primal members of these genera are not in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, there will be many primal beings other than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>--which is absurd.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Every <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> is in a subject. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be a subject, for "no simple form can be a subject", as <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Trin.). Therefore in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there cannot be any <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> From all we have said, it is clear there can be no <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>First, because a subject is compared to its <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> as <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a>; for a subject is in some sense made <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actual</a> by its <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>. But there can be no <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as was shown (2, 3).

<p>Secondly, because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is His own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; and as <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (Hebdom.), although every <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> may have something superadded to it, this cannot apply to absolute being: thus a heated <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> can have something extraneous to heat added to it, as whiteness, nevertheless absolute heat can have nothing else than heat.

<p>Thirdly, because what is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> is prior to what is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>. Whence as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is absolute primal being, there can be in Him nothing <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>. Neither can He have any <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> (as the capability of laughing is an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>), because such <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the constituent principles of the subject. Now there can be nothing <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since He is the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Hence it follows that there is no <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">Virtue</a> and wisdom are not predicated of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of us univocally. Hence it does not follow that there are <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as there are in us.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is prior to its <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, the principles of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> are reducible to the principles of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> as to that which is prior; although <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not first as if contained in the genus of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>; yet He is first in respect to all being, outside of every genus.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether God is altogether simple?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not altogether simple. For whatever is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> must imitate Him. Thus from the first being are all beings; and from the first <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But in the things which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has made, nothing is altogether simple. Therefore neither is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> altogether simple.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever is best must be attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But with us that which is composite is better than that which is simple; thus, chemical compounds are better than simple elements, and animals than the parts that compose them. Therefore it cannot be said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is altogether simple.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iv, 6,7): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> and absolutely simple."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The absolute simplicity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may be shown in many ways.

<p>First, from the previous articles of this question. For there is neither composition of quantitative parts in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since He is not a body; nor composition of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>; nor does His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> differ from His "suppositum"; nor His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> from His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; neither is there in Him composition of genus and difference, nor of subject and <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>. Therefore, it is clear that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is nowise composite, but is altogether simple.

<p>Secondly, because every composite is posterior to its component parts, and is dependent on them; but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the first being, as shown above (Question 2, Article 3).

<p>Thirdly, because every composite has a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, for things in themselves different cannot unite unless something <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> them to unite. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is uncaused, as shown above (Question 2, Article 3), since He is the first efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p>Fourthly, because in every composite there must be <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> and <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a>; but this does not apply to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for either one of the parts actuates another, or at least all the parts are potential to the whole.

<p>Fifthly, because nothing composite can be predicated of any single one of its parts. And this is evident in a whole made up of dissimilar parts; for no part of a man is a man, nor any of the parts of the foot, a foot. But in wholes made up of similar parts, although something which is predicated of the whole may be predicated of a part (as a part of the air is air, and a part of water, water), nevertheless certain things are predicable of the whole which cannot be predicated of any of the parts; for instance, if the whole volume of water is two cubits, no part of it can be two cubits. Thus in every composite there is something which is not it itself. But, even if this could be said of whatever has a form, viz. that it has something which is not it itself, as in a white object there is something which does not belong to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of white; nevertheless in the form itself, there is nothing besides itself. And so, since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is absolute form, or rather absolute being, He can be in no way composite. <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> implies this argument, when he says (De Trin. vii): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is strength, is not made up of things that are weak; nor is He Who is light, composed of things that are dim."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Whatever is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> imitates Him, as <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> things imitate the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But it is of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of a thing to be in some sort composite; because at least its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> differs from its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, as will be shown hereafter, (4, 3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> With us composite things are better than simple things, because the perfections of created <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> cannot be found in one simple thing, but in many things. But the perfection of divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is found in one simple thing (4, 1 and 6, 2).

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether God enters into the composition of other things?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> enters into the composition of other things, for <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. iv): "The being of all things is that which is above being--the Godhead." But the being of all things enters into the composition of everything. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> enters into the composition of other things.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a form; for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Verb. Dom., [Serm. xxxviii) that, "the word of God, which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is an uncreated form." But a form is part of a compound. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is part of some compound.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whatever things <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, in no way differing from each other, are the same. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, and in no way differ from each other. Therefore they are absolutely the same. But primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> enters into the composition things. Therefore also does <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Proof of the minor--whatever things differ, they differ by some differences, and therefore must be composite. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> are altogether simple. Therefore they nowise differ from each other.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. ii): "There can be no touching Him," i.e. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, "nor any other union with Him by mingling part with part."

<p>Further, the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> rules all things without commingling with them, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Causis).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> On this point there have been three <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. Some have affirmed that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the world-soul, as is clear from <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei vii, 6). This is practically the same as the opinion of those who assert that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the highest <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Again, others have said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the formal principle of all things; and this was the theory of the Almaricians. The third <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is that of <a href="../cathen/04645a.htm">David of Dinant</a>, who most absurdly taught that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Now all these contain manifest untruth; since it is not possible for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to enter into the composition of anything, either as a formal or a material principle.

<p>First, because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the first efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Now the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is not identical numerically with the form of the thing <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a>, but only specifically: for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> begets <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> can be neither numerically nor specifically identical with an efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; for the former is merely potential, while the latter is actual.

<p>Secondly, because, since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the first efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, to act belongs to Him primarily and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>. But that which enters into composition with anything does not act primarily and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, but rather the composite so acts; for the hand does not act, but the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by his hand; and, fire warms by its heat. Hence <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be part of a compound.

<p>Thirdly, because no part of a compound can be absolutely primal among beings--not even <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, nor form, though they are the primal parts of every compound. For <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is merely potential; and <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> is absolutely posterior to <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a>, as is clear from the foregoing (3, 1): while a form which is part of a compound is a participated form; and as that which participates is posterior to that which is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a>, so likewise is that which is participated; as fire in ignited objects is posterior to fire that is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> such. Now it has been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is absolutely primal being (2, 3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The Godhead is called the being of all things, as their efficient and exemplar <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but not as being their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The Word is an exemplar form; but not a form that is part of a compound.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Simple things do not differ by added differences--for this is the property of compounds. Thus <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and horse differ by their differences, rational and irrational; which differences, however, do not differ from each other by other differences. Hence, to be quite accurate, it is better to say that they are, not different, but diverse. Hence, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. x), "things which are diverse are absolutely distinct, but things which are different differ by something." Therefore, strictly speaking, primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> do not differ, but are by their very being, diverse. Hence it does not follow they are the same.
