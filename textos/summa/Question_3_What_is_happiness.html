<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether happiness is something uncreated?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is something uncreated. For <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Consol. iii): "We must needs confess that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> itself."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a>. But it belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be the <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a>. Since, then, there are not several supreme goods, it seems that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is the same as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is the last end, to which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will tends <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will should tend to nothing else as an end, but to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who alone is to be enjoyed, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 5,22). Therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is the same as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Nothing made is uncreated. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is something made; because according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Doctr. Christ. i, 3): "Those things are to be enjoyed which make us <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is not something uncreated.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1, 8; 2, 7), our end is twofold. First, there is the thing itself which we desire to attain: thus for the miser, the end is money. Secondly there is the attainment or possession, the use or enjoyment of the thing desired; thus we may say that the end of the miser is the possession of money; and the end of the intemperate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is to enjoy something pleasurable. In the first sense, then, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> last end is the uncreated <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, namely, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who alone by His <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> can perfectly satisfy <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will. But in the second way, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> last end is something <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in him, and this is nothing else than the attainment or enjoyment of the last end. Now the last end is called <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. If, therefore, we consider <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> or object, then it is something uncreated; but if we consider it as to the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, then it is something <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> by His Essence: for He is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> not by acquisition or participation of something else, but by His Essence. On the other hand, men are <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Consol. iii), by participation; just as they are called "gods," by participation. And this participation of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, in respect of which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is said to be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, is something <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Happiness is called <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a>, because it is the attainment or enjoyment of the <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Happiness is said to be the last end, in the same way as the attainment of the end is called the end.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether happiness is an operation?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is not an operation. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse22">Romans 6:22</a>): "You have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end, life everlasting." But life is not an operation, but the very being of living things. Therefore the last end, which is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, is not an operation.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Consol. iii) that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is "a state made perfect by the aggregate of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things." But state does not indicate operation. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is not an operation.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> signifies something <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> one: since it is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> final perfection. But the meaning of operation does not imply anything <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the operator, but rather something proceeding therefrom. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is not an operation.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> remains in the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> one. Now operation does not remain, but passes. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is not an operation.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, to one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> there is one <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. But operations are many. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is not an operation.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> one uninterruptedly. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> operation is often interrupted; for instance, by sleep, or some other occupation, or by cessation. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is not an operation.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. i, 13) that "<a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is an operation according to perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In so far as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is something <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in him, we must needs say that it is an operation. For <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> supreme perfection. Now each thing is perfect in so far as it is actual; since <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> without act is imperfect. Consequently <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> must consist in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> last act. But it is evident that operation is the last act of the operator, wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> calls it "second act" (De Anima ii, 1): because that which has a form can be <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a> operating, just as he who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> is <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a> considering. And hence it is that in other things, too, each one is said to be "for its operation" (De Coel ii, 3). Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> must of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> consist in an operation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Life is taken in two senses. First for the very being of the living. And thus <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is not life: since it has been shown (2, 05) that the being of a man, no <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in what it may consist, is not that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>; for of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is it <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that His Being is His Happiness. Secondly, life means the operation of the living, by which operation the principle of life is made actual: thus we speak of active and contemplative life, or of a life of pleasure. And in this sense <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> is said to be the last end, as is clear from <a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse3">John 17:3</a>: "This is <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, that they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Thee, the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a>, in defining <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, considered <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> in general: for considered thus it is the perfect common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and he signified this by saying that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is "a state made perfect by the aggregate of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things," thus implying that the state of a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> consists in possessing the perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> expressed the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, showing by what <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is established in this state, and that it is by some kind of operation. And so it is that he proves <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> to be "the perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" (Ethic. i, 7).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated in Metaph. ix, 7 action is twofold. One proceeds from the agent into outward <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, such as "to burn" and "to cut." And such an operation cannot be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>: for such an operation is an action and a perfection, not of the agent, but rather of the patient, as is stated in the same passage. The other is an action that remains in the agent, such as to feel, to understand, and to will: and such an action is a perfection and an act of the agent. And such an operation can be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> signifies some final perfection; according as various things capable of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> can attain to various degrees of perfection, so must there be various meanings applied to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. For in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>; since His very Being is His operation, whereby He enjoys no other than Himself. In the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, the final perfection is in respect of some operation, by which they are united to the Uncreated Good: and this operation of theirs is one only and everlasting. But in men, according to their present state of life, the final perfection is in respect of an operation whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: but this operation neither can be continual, nor, consequently, is it one only, because operation is multiplied by being discontinued. And for this reason in the present state of life, perfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> cannot be attained by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a>, in placing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> in this life (Ethic. i, 10), says that it is imperfect, and after a long discussion, concludes: "We call men <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, but only as men." But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has promised us perfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, when we shall be "as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> . . . in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>" (<a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse30">Matthew 22:30</a>).

<p>Consequently in regard to this perfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, the objection fails: because in that state of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> mind will be united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by one, continual, everlasting operation. But in the present life, in as far as we fall short of the unity and continuity of that operation so do we fall short of perfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Nevertheless it is a participation of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>: and so much the greater, as the operation can be more continuous and more one. Consequently the active life, which is busy with many things, has less of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> than the contemplative life, which is busied with one thing, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And if at any time <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not actually engaged in this operation, yet since he can always easily turn to it, and since he ordains the very cessation, by sleeping or occupying himself otherwise, to the aforesaid occupation, the latter seems, as it were, continuous. From these remarks the replies to Objections 5 and 6 are evident.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether happiness is an operation of the sensitive part, or of the intellective part only?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in an operation of the senses also. For there is no more excellent operation in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> than that of the senses, except the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> operation. But in us the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> operation depends on the sensitive: since "we cannot understand without a phantasm" (De Anima iii, 7). Therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in an operation of the senses also.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Consol. iii) that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is "a state made perfect by the aggregate of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things." But some goods are sensible, which we attain by the operation of the senses. Therefore it seems that the operation of the senses is needed for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is the perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as we find <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in Ethic. i, 7: which would not be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, were not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> perfected thereby in all his parts. But some parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are perfected by sensitive operations. Therefore sensitive operation is required for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Irrational animals have the sensitive operation in common with us: but they have not <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> in common with us. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> does not consist in a sensitive operation.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing may belong to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> in three ways: (1) <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, (2) antecedently, (3) consequently. Now the operation of sense cannot belong to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> in his being united to the Uncreated Good, Which is his last end, as shown above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>): to Which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot be united by an operation of his senses. Again, in like manner, because, as shown above (Question 2, Article 5), <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> does not consist in goods of the body, which goods alone, however, we attain through the operation of the senses.

<p>Nevertheless the operations of the senses can belong to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, both antecedently and consequently: antecedently, in respect of imperfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, such as can be had in this life, since the operation of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> demands a previous operation of the sense; consequently, in that perfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> which we await in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>; because at the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, "from the very <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. ad Dioscor.) "the body and the bodily senses will receive a certain overflow, so as to be perfected in their operations"; a point which will be explained further on when we treat of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> (II-II, 82 -85). But then the operation whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> mind is united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will not depend on the senses.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This objection proves that the operation of the senses is required antecedently for imperfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, such as can be had in this life.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Perfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, such as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have, includes the aggregate of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, by being united to the universal source of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; not that it requires each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But in this imperfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, we need the aggregate of those goods that suffice for the most perfect operation of this life.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In perfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> the entire <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is perfected, in the lower part of his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, by an overflow from the higher. But in the imperfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of this life, it is otherwise; we advance from the perfection of the lower part to the perfection of the higher part.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether, if happiness is in the intellective part, it is an operation of the intellect or of the will?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xix, 10,11), that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in peace; wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/psa147.htm#verse3">Psalm 147:3</a>): "Who hath placed peace in thy end [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'borders']". But peace pertains to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in an operation of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the last end corresponds to the first mover: thus the last end of the whole army is victory, which is the end of the general, who moves all the men. But the first mover in regard to operations is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: because it moves the other powers, as we shall state further on (9, 1,3). Therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> regards the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, if <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> be an operation, it must needs be <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> most excellent operation. But the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, is a more excellent operation than <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which is an operation of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> declares (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm">1 Corinthians 13</a>). Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiii, 5) that "<a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> is he who has whatever he desires, and desires nothing amiss." And a little further on (6) he adds: "He is most <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> who desires well, whatever he desires: for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things make a man <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, and such a man already possesses some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>--i.e. a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse3">John 17:3</a>): "This is <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>: that they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Thee, the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> is the last end, as stated above (02, ad 1). Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is an act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 2, Article 6) two things are needed for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>: one, which is the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>: the other, that is, as it were, its proper <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, i.e. the delight connected with it. I say, then, that as to the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, it is impossible for it to consist in an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. For it is evident from what has been said (1,2; 2, 7) that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is the attainment of the last end. But the attainment of the end does not consist in the very act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is directed to the end, both absent, when it desires it; and present, when it is delighted by resting therein. Now it is evident that the desire itself of the end is not the attainment of the end, but is a movement towards the end: while delight comes to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> from the end being present; and not conversely, is a thing made present, by the fact that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> delights in it. Therefore, that the end be present to him who desires it, must be due to something else than an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p>This is evidently the case in regard to sensible ends. For if the acquisition of money were through an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, the covetous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would have it from the very moment that he wished for it. But at the moment it is far from him; and he attains it, by grasping it in his hand, or in some like manner; and then he delights in the money got. And so it is with an intelligible end. For at first we desire to attain an intelligible end; we attain it, through its being made present to us by an act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; and then the delighted will rests in the end when attained.

<p>So, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in an act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>: but the delight that results from <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> pertains to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. In this sense <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. x, 23) that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is "<a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>," because, to wit, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> itself is the consummation of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Peace pertains to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> last end, not as though it were the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>; but because it is antecedent and consequent thereto: antecedent, in so far as all those things are removed which disturb and hinder <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in attaining the last end: consequent inasmuch as when <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has attained his last end, he remains at peace, his desire being at rest.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The will's first object is not its act: just as neither is the first object of the sight, vision, but a visible thing. Wherefore, from the very fact that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will's</a> first object, it follows that it does not belong to it as its act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> apprehends the end before the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does: yet motion towards the end begins in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. And therefore to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> belongs that which last of all follows the attainment of the end, viz. delight or enjoyment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Love ranks above <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in moving, but <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> precedes love in attaining: for "naught is loved save what is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. x, 1). Consequently we first attain an intelligible end by an act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; just as we first attain a sensible end by an act of sense.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> He who has whatever he desires, is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, because he has what he desires: and this indeed is by something other than the act of his will. But to desire nothing amiss is needed for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, as a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> disposition thereto. And a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is reckoned among the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things which make a man <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, forasmuch as it is an inclination of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: just as a movement is reduced to the genus of its terminus, for instance, "alteration" to the genus "<a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>."

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether happiness is an operation of the speculative, or of the practical intellect?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is an operation of the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. For the end of every creature consists in becoming like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by his practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of things understood, rather than by his speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which derives its <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from things. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in an operation of the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> rather than of the speculative.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is ordained to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> rather than the speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which is ordained to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Hence we are said to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, in reference to the perfection of the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, but not in reference to the perfection of the speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, according to which we are said to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> or understanding. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in an act of the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> rather than of the speculative.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> himself. But the speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is more concerned with things outside <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; whereas the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is concerned with things belonging to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> himself, viz. his operations and <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in an operation of the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> rather than of the speculative.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. i, 8) that "<a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> is promised us, as being the goal of all our actions, and the everlasting perfection of our <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joys</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Happiness consists in an operation of the speculative rather than of the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. This is evident for three reasons. First because if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is an operation, it must needs be <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> highest operation. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> highest operation is that of his highest power in respect of its highest object: and his highest power is the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, whose highest object is the Divine Good, which is the object, not of the practical but of the speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Consequently <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists principally in such an operation, viz. in the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of Divine things. And since that "seems to be each <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> self, which is best in him," according to Ethic. ix, 8, and x, 7, therefore such an operation is most proper to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and most delightful to him.

<p>Secondly, it is evident from the fact that <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> is sought principally for its own sake. But the act of the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not sought for its own sake but for the sake of action: and these very actions are ordained to some end. Consequently it is evident that the last end cannot consist in the active life, which pertains to the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p>Thirdly, it is again evident, from the fact that in the contemplative life <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has something in common with things above him, viz. with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, to whom he is made like by <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. But in things pertaining to the active life, other animals also have something in common with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, although imperfectly.

<p>Therefore the last and perfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, which we await in the life to come, consists entirely in <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>. But imperfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, such as can be had here, consists first and principally in <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, but secondarily, in an operation of the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> directing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions and <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, as stated in Ethic. x, 7,8.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The asserted likeness of the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is one of proportion; that is to say, by reason of its standing in relation to what it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does to what He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>. But the likeness of the speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is one of union and "information"; which is a much greater likeness. And yet it may be answered that, in regard to the principal thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, which is His Essence, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has not practical but merely speculative <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is ordained to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is outside of it: but the speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> has <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> within it, viz. the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And if this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> be perfect, the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is perfected and made <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thereby: such a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> has not; but it directs <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> thereto.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument would hold, if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> himself were his own last end; for then the consideration and direction of his actions and <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> would be his <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. But since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> last end is something outside of him, to wit, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to Whom we reach out by an operation of the speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; therefore, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in an operation of the speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> rather than of the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether happiness consists in the consideration of speculative sciences?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in the consideration of speculative <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. i, 13) that "<a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is an operation according to perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>." And in distinguishing the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, he gives no more than three speculative <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>--"<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>," "wisdom" and "understanding," which all belong to the consideration of speculative <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> final <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in the consideration of speculative <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which all desire for its own sake, seems to be <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> final <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Now such is the consideration of speculative <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>; because, as stated in Metaph. i, 1, "all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> desire to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>"; and, a little farther on (2), it is stated that speculative <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> are sought for their own sakes. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in the consideration of speculative <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> final perfection. Now everything is perfected, according as it is reduced from <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to act. But the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is reduced to act by the consideration of speculative <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. Therefore it seems that in the consideration of these <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> final <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/jer009.htm#verse23">Jeremiah 9:23</a>): "Let not the wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in his wisdom": and this is said in reference to speculative <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> final <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> does not consist in the consideration of these.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (02, ad 4), <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is twofold, one perfect, the other imperfect. And by perfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> we are to understand that which attains to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> notion of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>; and by imperfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> that which does not attain thereto, but partakes of some particular likeness of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Thus perfect <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, with whom is the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of things to be done; while imperfect <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is in certain irrational animals, who are possessed of certain particular instincts in respect of works similar to works of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p>Accordingly perfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> cannot consist <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> in the consideration of speculative <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. To <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> this, we must observe that the consideration of a speculative science does not extend beyond the scope of the principles of that science: since the entire science is virtually contained in its principles. Now the first principles of speculative <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> are received through the senses, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> clearly states at the beginning of the Metaphysics (i, 1), and at the end of the Posterior Analytics (ii, 15). Wherefore the entire consideration of speculative <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> cannot extend farther than <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of sensibles can lead. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> final <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, which is his final perfection cannot consist in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of sensibles. For a thing is not perfected by something lower, except in so far as the lower partakes of something higher. Now it is evident that the form of a stone or of any sensible, is lower than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not perfected by the form of a stone, as such, but inasmuch as it partakes of a certain likeness to that which is above the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, viz. the intelligible light, or something of the kind. Now whatever is by something else is reduced to that which is of itself. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> final perfection must needs be through <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of something above the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. But it has been shown (I, 88, 2), that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot acquire through sensibles, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, which are above the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Consequently it follows that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> cannot consist in the consideration of speculative <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. However, just as in sensible forms there is a participation of the higher <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, so the consideration of speculative <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> is a certain participation of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and perfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In his book on Ethics the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> treats of imperfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, such as can be had in this life, as stated above (02, ad 4).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Not only is perfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> desired, but also any likeness or participation thereof.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is reduced to act, in a fashion, by the consideration of speculative <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, but not to its final and perfect act.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether happiness consists in the knowledge of separate substances, namely, angels?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, namely, <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says in a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> (xxvi in Evang.): "It avails nothing to take part in the feasts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, if we fail to take part in the feasts of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>"; by which he means final <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. But we can take part in the feasts of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> by contemplating them. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> final <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in contemplating the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the final perfection of each thing is for it to be united to its principle: wherefore a circle is said to be a perfect figure, because its beginning and end coincide. But the beginning of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is from the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, by whom men are enlightened, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. iv). Therefore the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> consists in contemplating the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, each <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is perfect, when united to a higher <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; just as the final perfection of a body is to be united to the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But above the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order, are the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Therefore the final perfection of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is to be united to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> by <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/jer009.htm#verse24">Jeremiah 9:24</a>): "Let him that glorieth, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in this, that he understandeth and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> Me." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> final <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> or <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists only in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#6">Article 6</a>), <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> perfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists not in that which perfects the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> by some participation, but in that which is so by its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Now it is evident that whatever is the perfection of a power is so in so far as the proper formal object of that power belongs to it. Now the proper object of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of whatever has participated <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, does not perfect the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> with its final perfection. Since, therefore, the order of things is the same in being and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> (Metaph ii, 1); whatever are beings by participation, are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> by participation. Now <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have being by participation: because in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is His Being His Essence, as shown in the I, 44, 1. It follows that <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of Him makes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> perfectly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>. However, there is no reason why we should not admit a certain imperfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; and higher indeed than in the consideration of speculative science.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> We shall take part in the feasts of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, by contemplating not only the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but, together with them, also <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> According to those that hold <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to be <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, it seems fitting enough, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> should consist in the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, in the union, as it were, of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with his beginning. But this is <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>, as stated in I, 90, 3. Wherefore the final perfection of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is by union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is the first principle both of the creation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and of its enlightenment. Whereas the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> enlightens as a minister, as stated in the I, 111, 2, ad 2. Consequently, by his ministration he helps <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to attain to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>; but he is not the object of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The lower <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> may reach the higher in two ways. First, according to a degree of the participating power: and thus <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> final perfection will consist in his attaining to a <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> such as that of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Secondly, as the object is attained by the power: and thus the final perfection of each power is to attain that in which is found the fulness of its formal object.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether man's happiness consists in the vision of the divine essence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> does not consist in the vision of the Divine Essence. For <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Myst. Theol. i) that by that which is highest in his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as to something altogether unknown. But that which is seen in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is not altogether unknown. Therefore the final perfection of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, namely, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, does not consist in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> being seen in His Essence.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the higher the perfection belongs to the higher <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But to see His own Essence is the perfection proper to the Divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore the final perfection of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> does not reach to this, but consists in something less.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse2">1 John 3:2</a>): "When He shall appear, we shall be like to Him; and [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'because'] we shall see Him as He is."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Final and perfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> can consist in nothing else than the vision of the Divine Essence. To make this clear, two points must be observed. First, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not perfectly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, so long as something remains for him to desire and seek: secondly, that the perfection of any power is determined by the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of its object. Now the object of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is "what a thing is," i.e. the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of a thing, according to De Anima iii, 6. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> attains perfection, in so far as it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of a thing. If therefore an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of some effect, whereby it is not possible to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, i.e. to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> "what it is"; that <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> cannot be said to reach that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> simply, although it may be able to gather from the effect the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of that the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is. Consequently, when <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> an effect, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that it has a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, there <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> remains in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> the desire to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> about the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, "what it is." And this desire is one of wonder, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> inquiry, as is stated in the beginning of the Metaphysics (i, 2). For instance, if a man, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the eclipse of the sun, consider that it must be due to some <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is, he wonders about it, and from wondering proceeds to inquire. Nor does this inquiry cease until he arrive at a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p>If therefore the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of some <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> effect, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> no more of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than "that He is"; the perfection of that <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> does not yet reach simply the First Cause, but there remains in it the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> desire to seek the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Wherefore it is not yet perfectly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>. Consequently, for perfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> needs to reach the very Essence of the First Cause. And thus it will have its perfection through union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as with that object, in which alone <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists, as stated above (1,7; 2, 8).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> speaks of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of wayfarers journeying towards <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above (Question 1, Article 8), the end has a twofold acceptation. First, as to the thing itself which is desired: and in this way, the same thing is the end of the higher and of the lower <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and indeed of all things, as stated above (Question 1, Article 8). Secondly, as to the attainment of this thing; and thus the end of the higher <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is different from that of the lower, according to their respective habitudes to that thing. So then in the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who, in understanding his Essence, comprehends It, is higher than that of a man or <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who sees It indeed, but comprehends It not.
