<h1>Question 40. Christ's manner of life</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/4040.htm#article1"> Should Christ have led a solitary life, or should he have associated with men?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4040.htm#article2"> Should He have led an austere life as regards food, drink, and clothing?

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether Christ should have associated with men, or led a solitary life?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should not have associated with men, but should have led a solitary life. For it behooved <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to show by His manner of life not only that He was <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but also that He was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But it is not becoming that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should associate with men, for it is written (<a href="../bible/dan002.htm#verse11">Daniel 2:11</a>): "Except the gods, whose conversation is not with men"; and the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Polit. i) that he who lives alone is "either a beast"--that is, if he do this from being wild--"or a god," if his motive be the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Therefore it seems that it was not becoming for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to associate with men.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, while He lived in mortal flesh, it behooved <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to lead a most perfect life. But the most perfect is the contemplative life, as we have stated in the II-II, 182, 1,2. Now, solitude is most suitable to the contemplative life; according to <a href="../bible/hos002.htm#verse14">Hosea 2:14</a>: "I will lead her into the wilderness, and I will speak to her heart." Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should have led a solitary life.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> manner of life should have been uniform: because it should always have given evidence of that which is best. But at times <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> avoided the crowd and sought lonely places: hence <a href="../cathen/12764a.htm">Remigius</a> [Cf. Catena Aurea, Matth. 5:1], commenting on Matthew, says: "We read that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> had three places of refuge: the ship, the mountain, the desert; to one or other of which He betook Himself whenever he was harassed by the crowd." Therefore He ought always to have led a solitary life.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/bar003.htm#verse38">Baruch 3:38</a>): "Afterwards He was seen upon earth and conversed with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> manner of life had to be in keeping with the end of His <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, by reason of which He came into the world. Now He came into the world, first, that He might publish the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. thus He says Himself (<a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse37">John 18:37</a>): "For this was I born, and for this came I into the world, that I should give testimony to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." Hence it was fitting not that He should hide Himself by leading a solitary life, but that He should appear openly and preach in public. Wherefore (<a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse42">Luke 4:42-43</a>) He says to those who wished to stay Him: "To other cities also I must preach the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>: for therefore am I sent."

<p>Secondly, He came in order to free men from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; according to <a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse15">1 Timothy 1:15</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a> came into this world to save sinners." And hence, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says, "although <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> might, while staying in the same place, have drawn all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to Himself, to hear His preaching, yet He did not do so; thus giving us the example to go about and seek those who perish, like the shepherd in his search of the lost sheep, and the physician in his attendance on the sick."

<p>Thirdly, He came that by Him "we might have access to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," as it is written (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse2">Romans 5:2</a>). And thus it was fitting that He should give men confidence in approaching Him by associating familiarly with them. Wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse10">Matthew 9:10</a>): "It came to pass as He was sitting . . . in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came, and sat down with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>." On which <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> comments as follows: "They had seen the publican who had been converted from a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> to a better life: and consequently they did not <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> of their own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> wished to make His Godhead <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. And therefore, since it is proper to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to do so, He associated with men, at the same time manifesting His Godhead to all, by preaching and working <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and by leading among men a blameless and righteous life.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated in the II-II, 182, 1; SS, 188, 6, the contemplative life is, absolutely speaking, more perfect than the active life, because the latter is taken up with bodily actions: yet that form of active life in which a man, by preaching and teaching, delivers to others the fruits of his <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, is more perfect than the life that stops at <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, because such a life is built on an abundance of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, and consequently such was the life chosen by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> action is our instruction. And therefore, in order to teach preachers that they ought not to be for ever before the public, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> withdrew Himself sometimes from the crowd. We are told of three reasons for His doing this. First, for the rest of the body: hence (<a href="../bible/mar006.htm#verse31">Mark 6:31</a>) it is stated that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: "Come apart into a desert place, and rest a little. For there were many coming and going: and they had not so much as time to eat." But sometimes it was for the sake of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; thus it is written (<a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse12">Luke 6:12</a>): "It came to pass in those days, that He went out into a mountain to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>; and He passed the whole night in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." On this <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> remarks that "by His example He instructs us in the precepts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>." And sometimes He did so in order to teach us to avoid the favor of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>, <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse1">Matthew 5:1</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, "seeing the multitude, went up into a mountain," says: "By sitting not in the city and in the market-place, but on a mountain and in a place of solitude, He taught us to do nothing for show, and to withdraw from the crowd, especially when we have to discourse of needful things."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether it was becoming that Christ should lead an austere life in this world?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it was becoming that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should lead an austere life in this world. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> preached the perfection of life much more than John did. But John led an austere life in order that he might persuade men by his example to embrace a perfect life; for it is written (<a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse4">Matthew 3:4</a>) that "the same John had his garment of camel's hair and a leathern girdle about his loins: and his meat was locusts and wild honey"; on which <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> comments as follows (Hom. x): "It was a marvelous and strange thing to behold such austerity in a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> frame: which thing also particularly attracted the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>." Therefore it seems that an austere life was much more becoming to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, abstinence is ordained to <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a>; for it is written (<a href="../bible/hos004.htm#verse10">Hosea 4:10</a>): "They shall eat and shall not be filled; they have committed fornication, and have not ceased." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> both observed <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a> in Himself and proposed it to be observed by others when He said (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse12">Matthew 19:12</a>): "There are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>: he that can take it let him take it." Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should have observed an austere life both in Himself and in His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it seems absurd for a man to begin a stricter form of life and to return to an easier life: for one might quote to his discredit that which is written, <a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse30">Luke 14:30</a>: "This <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> began to build, and was not able to finish." Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> began a very strict life after His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, remaining in the desert and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> for "forty days and forty nights." Therefore it seems unbecoming that, after leading such a strict life, He should return to the common manner of living.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse19">Matthew 11:19</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> came eating and drinking."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), it was in keeping with the end of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should not lead a solitary life, but should associate with men. Now it is most fitting that he who associates with others should conform to their manner of living; according to the words of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse22">1 Corinthians 9:22</a>): "I became all things to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>." And therefore it was most fitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should conform to others in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of eating and drinking. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Faust. xvi) that "John is described as 'neither eating nor drinking,' because he did not take the same food as the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>. Therefore, unless <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> had taken it, it would not be said of Him, in contrast, 'eating and drinking.'"

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In His manner of living <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> gave an example of perfection as to all those things which of themselves relate to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Now abstinence in eating and drinking does not of itself relate to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse17">Romans 14:17</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> is not meat and drink." And <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Qq. Evang. ii, qu. 11) explains <a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse19">Matthew 11:19</a>, "Wisdom is justified by her children," saying that this is because the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">holy apostles</a> "understood that the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> does not consist in eating and drinking, but in suffering indigence with equanimity," for they are neither uplifted by affluence, nor distressed by want. Again (De Doctr. Christ. iii), he says that in all such things "it is not making use of them, but the wantonness of the user, that is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>." Now both these lives are lawful and praiseworthy--namely, that a man withdraw from the society of other men and observe abstinence; and that he associate with other men and live like them. And therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> wished to give men an example of either kind of life.

<p>As to John, according to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> (Hom. xxxvii super Matth.), "he exhibited no more than his life and righteous conduct . . . but <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had the testimony also of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. Leaving, therefore, John to be illustrious by his <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, He Himself came the opposite way, both coming unto publicans' tables and eating and drinking."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as by abstinence other men acquire the power of self-restraint, so also <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in Himself and in those that are His, subdued the flesh by the power of His Godhead. Wherefore, as we read <a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse14">Matthew 9:14</a>, the Pharisees and the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of John fasted, but not the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. On which <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> comments, saying that "John drank neither wine nor strong drink: because abstinence is <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> where the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is weak. But why should <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>, whose right by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> it is to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, avoid those whom He could make <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holier</a> than such as abstain?"

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. xiii super Matth.), "that thou mightest learn how great a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, and how it is a shield against the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and that after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> thou shouldst give thyself up, not to luxury, but to <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>--for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> did He fast, not as needing it Himself, but as teaching us . . . And for this did He proceed no further than <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elias, lest His assumption of our flesh might seem incredible." The mystical meaning, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xvi in Evang.), is that by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> example the number "forty" is observed in His fast, because the power of the "<a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> is fulfilled throughout the four books of the Holy Gospel: since ten multiplied by four amounts to forty." Or, because "we live in this mortal body composed of the four elements, and by its lusts we transgress the commandments of the Lord, which are expressed in the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>." Or, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (QQ. lxxxiii, qu. 81): "To <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a> and the creature is the entire teaching of wisdom. The Creator is the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, the Father, the Son, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Now the creature is partly invisible, as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, to which the number three may be ascribed, for we are commanded to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in three ways, 'with our whole heart, our whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and our whole mind'; and partly visible, as the body, to which the number four is applicable on account of its being subject to heat, moisture, cold, and dryness. Hence if we multiply ten, which may be referred to the entire moral code, by four, which number may be applied to the body, because it is the body that executes the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, the product is the number forty: in which," consequently, "the time during which we sigh and grieve is shown forth." And yet there was no inconsistency in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> returning to the common manner of living, after <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and (retiring into the) desert. For it is becoming to that kind of life, which we hold <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to have embraced, wherein a man delivers to others the fruits of his <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, that he devote himself first of all to <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, and that he afterwards come down to the publicity of active life by associating with other men. Hence <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> says on <a href="../bible/mar002.htm#verse18">Mark 2:18</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> fasted, that thou mightest not disobey the commandment; He ate with sinners, that thou mightest discern His sanctity and acknowledge His power."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether Christ should have led a life of poverty in this world?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should not have led a life of <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> in this world. Because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should have embraced the most eligible form of life. But the most eligible form of life is that which is a mean between <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> and <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>; for it is written (<a href="../bible/pro030.htm#verse8">Proverbs 30:8</a>): "Give me neither beggary nor <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>; give me only the necessaries of life." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should have led a life, not of <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, but of moderation.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, external <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> is ordained to bodily use as to food and raiment. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> conformed His manner of life to those among whom He lived, in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of food and raiment. Therefore it seems that He should have observed the ordinary manner of life as to <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> and <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, and have avoided extreme <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> specially invited men to imitate His example of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse29">Matthew 11:29</a>: "Learn of Me, because I am meek and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> of heart." But <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is most commendable in the rich; thus it is written (<a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse11">1 Timothy 6:11</a>): "Charge the rich of this world not to be high-minded." Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should not have chosen a life of <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse20">Matthew 8:20</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> hath not where to lay His head": as though He were to say as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> observes: "Why desirest thou to follow Me for the sake of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> and worldly gain, since I am so poor that I have not even the smallest dwelling-place, and I am sheltered by a roof that is not Mine?" And on <a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse26">Matthew 17:26</a>: "That we may not <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalize</a> them, go to the sea," <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says: "This incident, taken literally, affords edification to those who hear it when they are told that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> was so poor that He had not the wherewithal to pay the tax for Himself and His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It was fitting for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to lead a life of <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> in this world. First, because this was in keeping with the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of preaching, for which purpose He says that He came (<a href="../bible/mar001.htm#verse38">Mark 1:38</a>): "Let us go into the neighboring towns and cities, that I may preach there also: for to this purpose am I come." Now in order that the preachers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> word may be able to give all their time to preaching, they must be wholly free from care of worldly matters: which is impossible for those who are possessed of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>. Wherefore the Lord Himself, when sending the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> to preach, said to them (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse9">Matthew 10:9</a>): "Do not possess gold nor silver." And the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> (<a href="../bible/act006.htm#verse2">Acts 6:2</a>) say: "It is not reasonable that we should leave the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and serve tables."

<p>Secondly, because just as He took upon Himself the death of the body in order to bestow <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life on us, so did He bear bodily <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, in order to enrich us spiritually, according to <a href="../bible/2co008.htm#verse9">2 Corinthians 8:9</a>: "You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>: that . . . He became poor for our [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'your'] sakes that through His <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> we [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'you'] might be rich."

<p>Thirdly, lest if He were rich His preaching might be ascribed to cupidity. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on <a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse9">Matthew 10:9</a>, that if the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> had been possessed of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, "they had seemed to preach for gain, not for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>." And the same reason applies to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p>Fourthly, that the more lowly He seemed by reason of His <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, the greater might the power of His Godhead be shown to be. Hence in a sermon of the Council of Ephesus (P. iii, c. ix) we read: "He chose all that was poor and despicable, all that was of small account and hidden from the majority, that we might recognize His Godhead to have transformed the terrestrial sphere. For this reason did He choose a poor <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">maid</a> for His Mother, a poorer birthplace; for this reason did He live in want. Learn this from the manger."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Those who wish to live virtuously need to avoid abundance of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> and beggary, in as far as these are occasions of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: since abundance of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> is an occasion for being proud; and beggary is an occasion of thieving and lying, or even of perjury. But forasmuch as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was incapable of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, He had not the same motive as Solomon for avoiding these things. Yet neither is every kind of beggary an occasion of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> and perjury, as Solomon seems to add (<a href="../bible/pro030.htm#verse8">Proverbs 30:8</a>); but only that which is involuntary, in order to avoid which, a man is guilty of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> and perjury. But <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> is not open to this danger: and such was the <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> chosen by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may feed and clothe himself in conformity with others, not only by possessing <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, but also by receiving the necessaries of life from those who are rich. This is what happened in regard to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: for it is written (<a href="../bible/luk008.htm#verse2">Luke 8:2-3</a>) that certain <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> followed <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and "ministered unto Him of their <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>." For, as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on <a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse55">Matthew 27:55</a>, "It was a Jewish custom, nor was it thought wrong for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, following the ancient tradition of their nation, out of their private means to provide their instructors with food and clothing. But as this might give <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says that he gave it up": thus it was possible for them to be fed out of a common fund, but not to possess <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, without their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of preaching being hindered by anxiety.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Humility is not much to be praised in one who is poor of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. But in one who, like <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, is poor willingly, <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> itself is a sign of very great <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether Christ conformed His conduct to the Law?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not conform His conduct to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> forbade any work whatsoever to be done on the Sabbath, since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done." But He healed a man on the Sabbath, and commanded him to take up his bed. Therefore it seems that He did not conform His conduct to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, what <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> taught, that He also did, according to <a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse1">Acts 1:1</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> began to do and to teach." But He taught (<a href="../bible/mat015.htm">Matthew 15:11</a>) that "not" all "that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man": and this is contrary to the precept of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, which declared that a man was made <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> by eating and touching certain animals, as stated <a href="../bible/lev011.htm">Leviticus 11</a>. Therefore it seems that He did not conform His conduct to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, he who consents to anything is of the same mind as he who does it, according to <a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse32">Romans 1:32</a>: "Not only they that do them, but they also that consent to them that do them." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by excusing His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, consented to their breaking the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> by plucking the ears of corn on the Sabbath; as is related <a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse1">Matthew 12:1-8</a>. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not conform His conduct to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse17">Matthew 5:17</a>): "Do not think that I am come to destroy the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> or the Prophets." Commenting on these words, <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says: "He fulfilled the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> . . . in one way, by transgressing none of the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>; secondly, by justifying us through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, in the letter, was unable to do."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> conformed His conduct in all things to the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. In token of this He wished even to be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>; for the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> is a kind of protestation of a man's purpose of keeping the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, according to <a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse3">Galatians 5:3</a>: "I testify to every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> circumcising himself, that he is a debtor to do the whole <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>."

<p>And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, indeed, wished to conform His conduct to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, first, to show His approval of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. Secondly, that by obeying the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> He might perfect it and bring it to an end in His own self, so as to show that it was ordained to Him. Thirdly, to deprive the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> of an excuse for slandering Him. Fourthly, in order to deliver men from subjection to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, according to <a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse4">Galatians 4:4-5</a>: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent His Son . . . made under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> that He might redeem them who were under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> excuses Himself from any transgression of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> in this matter, for three reasons. First, the precept of the hallowing of the Sabbath forbids not Divine work, but <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> work: for though <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> ceased on the seventh day from the creation of new creatures, yet He ever works by keeping and governing His creatures. Now that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> wrought <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> was a Divine work: hence He says (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse17">John 5:17</a>): "My Father worketh until now; and I work."

<p>Secondly, He excuses Himself on the ground that this precept does not forbid works which are needful for bodily health. Wherefore He says (<a href="../bible/luk013.htm#verse15">Luke 13:15</a>): "Doth not every one of you on the Sabbath-day loose his ox or his ass from the manger, and lead them to water?" And farther on (<a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse5">Luke 14:5</a>): "Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fall into a pit, and will not immediately draw him out on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath-day</a>?" Now it is manifest that the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> works done by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> related to health of body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p>Thirdly, because this precept does not forbid works pertaining to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore He says (<a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse5">Matthew 12:5</a>): "Have ye not read in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> that on the Sabbath-days the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the Temple break the Sabbath, and are without blame?" And (<a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse23">John 7:23</a>) it is written that a man receives <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath-day</a>. Now when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> commanded the paralytic to carry his bed on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath-day</a>, this pertained to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, i.e. to the praise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> power. And thus it is clear that He did not break the Sabbath: although the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> threw this <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> accusation in His face, saying (<a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse16">John 9:16</a>): "This <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who keepeth not the Sabbath."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> By those words <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> wished to show that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is made <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> as to his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, by the use of any sort of foods considered not in their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but only in some signification. And that certain foods are in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> called "<a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>" is due to some signification; whence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Faust. vi): "If a question be raised about swine and lambs, both are clean by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, since 'all <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> creatures are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>'; but by a certain signification lambs are clean and swine <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> also, when, being hungry, they plucked the ears of corn on the Sabbath, are to be excused from transgressing the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, since they were pressed by hunger: just as David did not transgress the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> when, through being compelled by hunger, he ate the loaves which it was not lawful for him to eat.
