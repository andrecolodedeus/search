<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether hope is the same as desire of cupidity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that hope is the same as desire or cupidity. Because hope is reckoned as one of the four principal <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. But <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> in setting down the four principal <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> puts cupidity in the place of hope (De Civ. Dei xiv, 3,7). Therefore hope is the same as cupidity or desire.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> differ according to their objects. But the object of hope is the same as the object of cupidity or desire, viz. the future <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore hope is the same as cupidity or desire.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> If it be said that hope, in addition to desire, denotes the possibility of obtaining the future <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; on the contrary, whatever is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to the object does not make a different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of passion. But possibility of acquisition is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to a future <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is the object of cupidity or desire, and of hope. Therefore hope does not differ specifically from desire or cupidity.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> To different powers belong different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. But hope is in the irascible power; whereas desire or cupidity is in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>. Therefore hope differs specifically from desire or cupidity.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> is taken from the object. Now, in the object of hope, we may note four conditions. First, that it is something <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; since, properly speaking, hope regards only the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; in this respect, hope differs from fear, which regards <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Secondly, that it is future; for hope does not regard that which is present and already possessed: in this respect, hope differs from <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> which regards a present <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Thirdly, that it must be something arduous and difficult to obtain, for we do not speak of any one hoping for trifles, which are in one's power to have at any time: in this respect, hope differs from desire or cupidity, which regards the future <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> absolutely: wherefore it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>, while hope belongs to the irascible faculty. Fourthly, that this difficult thing is something possible to obtain: for one does not hope for that which one cannot get at all: and, in this respect, hope differs from <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>. It is therefore evident that hope differs from desire, as the irascible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> differ from the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>. For this reason, moreover, hope presupposes desire: just as all irascible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> presuppose the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty, as stated above (Question 25, Article 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> mentions desire instead of hope, because each regards future <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and because the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is not arduous is reckoned as nothing: thus implying that desire seems to tend chiefly to the arduous <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, to which hope tends likewise.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The object of hope is the future <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> considered, not absolutely, but as arduous and difficult of attainment, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The object of hope adds not only possibility to the object of desire, but also difficulty: and this makes hope belong to another power, viz. the irascible, which regards something difficult, as stated in the I, 81, 2. Moreover, possibility and impossibility are not altogether <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to the object of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power: because the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is a principle of movement; and nothing is moved to anything except under the aspect of being possible; for no one is moved to that which he reckons impossible to get. Consequently hope differs from <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> according to the difference of possible and impossible.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether hope is in the apprehensive or in the appetitive power?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that hope belongs to the cognitive power. Because hope, seemingly, is a kind of awaiting; for the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse25">Romans 8:25</a>): "If we hope for that which we see not; we wait for it with patience." But awaiting seems to belong to the cognitive power, which we exercise by "looking out." Therefore hope belongs to the cognitive power.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, apparently hope is the same as confidence; hence when a man hopes he is said to be confident, as though to hope and to be confident were the same thing. But confidence, like <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, seems to belong to the cognitive power. Therefore hope does too.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> is a property of the cognitive power. But <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> is ascribed to hope. Therefore hope belongs to the cognitive power.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Hope regards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Now <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as such, is not the object of the cognitive, but of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power. Therefore hope belongs, not to the cognitive, but to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since hope denotes a certain stretching out of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it evidently belongs to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power; since movement towards things belongs properly to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>: whereas the action of the cognitive power is accomplished not by the movement of the knower towards things, but rather according as the things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> are in the knower. But since the cognitive power moves the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, by presenting its object to it; there arise in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> various movements according to various aspects of the apprehended object. For the apprehension of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> gives rise to one kind of movement in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, while the apprehension of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> gives rise to another: in like manner various movements arise from the apprehension of something present and of something future; of something considered absolutely, and of something considered as arduous; of something possible, and of something impossible. And accordingly hope is a movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power ensuing from the apprehension of a future <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, difficult but possible to obtain; namely, a stretching forth of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> to such a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Since hope regards a possible <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, there arises in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> a twofold movement of hope; for a thing may be possible to him in two ways, viz. by his own power, or by another's. Accordingly when a man hopes to obtain something by his own power, he is not said to wait for it, but simply to hope for it. But, properly speaking, he is said to await that which he hopes to get by another's help as though to await [exspectare] implied keeping one's eyes on another [ex alio spectare], in so far as the apprehensive power, by going ahead, not only keeps its eye on the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> intends to get, but also on the thing by whose power he hopes to get it; according to <a href="../bible/sir051.htm#verse10">Sirach 51:10</a>, "I looked for the succor of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>." Wherefore the movement of hope is sometimes called expectation, on account of the preceding inspection of the cognitive power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When a man desires a thing and reckons that he can get it, he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> that he can get it, he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> that he will get it; and from this <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> which precedes in the cognitive power, the ensuing movement in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is called confidence. Because the movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> takes its name from the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that precedes it, as an effect from a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> which is better <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; for the apprehensive power <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> its own act better than that of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Certainty is ascribed to the movement, not only of the sensitive, but also of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; thus we say that a stone is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> to tend downwards. This is owing to the inerrancy which the movement of the sensitive or even <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> derives from the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that precedes it.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether hope is in dumb animals?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is no hope in dumb animals. Because hope is for some future <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 12). But <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the future is not in the competency of dumb animals, whose <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is confined to the senses and does not extend to the future. Therefore there is no hope in dumb animals.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the object of hope is a future <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, possible of attainment. But possible and impossible are differences of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, which are only in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Metaph. vi, 4). Therefore there is no hope in dumb animals, since they have no mind.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. ix, 14) that "animals are moved by the things that they see." But hope is of things unseen: "for what a man seeth, why doth he hope for?" (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse24">Romans 8:24</a>). Therefore there is no hope in dumb animals.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Hope is an irascible passion. But the irascible faculty is in dumb animals. Therefore hope is also.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The internal <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of animals can be gathered from their outward movements: from which it is clear that hope is in dumb animals. For if a dog see a hare, or a hawk see a bird, too far off, it makes no movement towards it, as having no hope to catch it: whereas, if it be near, it makes a movement towards it, as being in hopes of catching it. Because as stated above (1, 2; 26, 1; 35, 1), the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> of dumb animals, and likewise the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> of insensible things, result from the apprehension of an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, just as the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which is called the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. But there is a difference, in that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is moved by an apprehension of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in the same subject; whereas the movement of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> results from the apprehension of the separate Intellect, Who is the Author of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; as does also the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> of dumb animals, who act from a certain <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a>. Consequently, in the actions of irrational animals and of other <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things, we observe a procedure which is similar to that which we observe in the actions of art: and in this way hope and <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> are in dumb animals.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although dumb animals do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the future, yet an animal is moved by its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> instinct to something future, as though it foresaw the future. Because this instinct is planted in them by the Divine Intellect that foresees the future.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The object of hope is not the possible as differentiating the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, for thus the possible ensues from the relation of a predicate to a subject. The object of hope is the possible as compared to a power. For such is the division of the possible given in Metaph. v, 12, i.e. into the two kinds we have just mentioned.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although the thing which is future does not come under the object of sight; nevertheless through seeing something present, an animal's <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is moved to seek or avoid something future.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether despair is contrary to hope?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> is not contrary to hope. Because "to one thing there is one contrary" (Metaph. x, 5). But fear is contrary to hope. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> is not contrary to hope.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, contraries seem to bear on the same thing. But hope and <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> do not bear on the same thing: since hope regards the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, whereas <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> arises from some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that is in the way of obtaining <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore hope is not contrary to <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, movement is contrary to movement: while repose is in opposition to movement as a privation thereof. But <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> seems to imply immobility rather than movement. Therefore it is not contrary to <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, which implies movement of stretching out towards the hoped-for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The very name of <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> [desperatio] implies that it is contrary to hope [spes].

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 23, Article 2), there is a twofold contrariety of movements. One is in respect of approach to contrary terms: and this contrariety alone is to be found in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, for instance between love and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. The other is according to approach and withdrawal with regard to the same term; and is to be found in the irascible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, as stated above (Question 23, Article 2). Now the object of hope, which is the arduous <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, has the character of a principle of attraction, if it be considered in the light of something attainable; and thus hope tends thereto, for it denotes a kind of approach. But in so far as it is considered as unobtainable, it has the character of a principle of repulsion, because, as stated in Ethic. iii, 3, "when men come to an impossibility they disperse." And this is how <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> stands in regard to this object, wherefore it implies a movement of withdrawal: and consequently it is contrary to <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, as withdrawal is to approach.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Fear is contrary to <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, because their objects, i.e. <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, are contrary: for this contrariety is found in the irascible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, according as they ensue from the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>. But <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> is contrary to <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, only by contrariety of approach and withdrawal.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Despair does not regard <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as such; sometimes however it regards <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, as making the difficult <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> impossible to obtain. But it can arise from the mere excess of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Despair implies not only privation of hope, but also a recoil from the thing desired, by reason of its being esteemed impossible to get. Hence <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, like hope, presupposes desire; because we neither hope for nor <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> of that which we do not desire to have. For this reason, too, each of them regards the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is the object of desire.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether experience is a cause of hope?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that experience is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of hope. Because experience belongs to the cognitive power; wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 1) that "<a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> needs experience and time." But hope is not in the cognitive power, but in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Therefore experience is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of hope.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 13) that "the old are slow to <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, on account of their experience"; whence it seems to follow that experience <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> want of hope. But the same <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is not productive of opposites. Therefore experience is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of hope.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Coel. ii, 5) that "to have something to say about everything, without leaving anything out, is sometimes a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of folly." But to attempt everything seems to point to great hopes; while folly arises from inexperience. Therefore inexperience, rather than experience, seems to be a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of hope.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 8) "some are hopeful, through having been victorious often and over many opponents": which seems to pertain to experience. Therefore experience is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of hope.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), the object of hope is a future <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, difficult but possible to obtain. Consequently a thing may be a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of hope, either because it makes something possible to a man: or because it makes him think something possible. In the first way hope is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by everything that increases a man's power; e.g. <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, strength, and, among others, experience: since by experience <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> acquires the faculty of doing something easily, and the result of this is hope. Wherefore Vegetius says (De Re Milit. i): "No one <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> to do that which he is sure of having learned well."

<p>In the second way, hope is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by everything that makes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> think that he can obtain something: and thus both teaching and persuasion may be a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of hope. And then again experience is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of hope, in so far as it makes him reckon something possible, which before his experience he looked upon as impossible. However, in this way, experience can <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a lack of hope: because just as it makes a man think possible what he had previously thought impossible; so, conversely, experience makes a man consider as impossible that which hitherto he had thought possible. Accordingly experience <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> hope in two ways, <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> in one way: and for this reason we may say rather that it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> hope.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Experience in matters pertaining to action not only produces <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; it also <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a certain <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, by reason of custom, which renders the action easier. Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> itself adds to the power of acting with ease: because it shows something to be possible; and thus is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of hope.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The old are wanting in hope because of their experience, in so far as experience makes them think something impossible. Hence he adds (Rhet. ii, 13) that "many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> have befallen them."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Folly and inexperience can be a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of hope <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> as it were, by removing the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which would help one to judge <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a thing to be impossible. Wherefore inexperience is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of hope, for the same reason as experience <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> lack of hope.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether hope abounds in young men and drunkards?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that youth and drunkenness are not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of hope. Because hope implies <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> and steadiness; so much so that it is compared to an anchor (<a href="../bible/heb006.htm#verse19">Hebrews 6:19</a>). But young men and drunkards are wanting in steadiness; since their <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> are easily changed. Therefore youth and drunkenness are not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of hope.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as stated above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>), the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of hope is chiefly whatever increases one's power. But youth and drunkenness are united to weakness. Therefore they are not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of hope.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, experience is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of hope, as stated above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>). But youth lacks experience. Therefore it is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of hope.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 8) that "<a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunken</a> men are hopeful": and (Rhet. ii, 12) that "the young are full of hope."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Youth is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of hope for three reasons, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states in Rhet. ii, 12: and these three reasons may be gathered from the three <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is the object of hope--namely, that it is future, arduous and possible, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). For youth has much of the future before it, and little of the past: and therefore since <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> is of the past, and hope of the future, it has little to remember and lives very much in hope. Again, youths, on account of the heat of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, are full of spirit; so that their heart expands: and it is owing to the heart being expanded that one tends to that which is arduous; wherefore youths are spirited and hopeful. Likewise they who have not suffered defeat, nor had experience of obstacles to their efforts, are prone to count a thing possible to them. Wherefore youths, through inexperience of obstacles and of their own shortcomings, easily count a thing possible; and consequently are of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> hope. Two of these <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> are also in those who are in drink--viz. heat and high spirits, on account of wine, and heedlessness of dangers and shortcomings. For the same reason all foolish and thoughtless <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> attempt everything and are full of hope.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although youths and men in drink lack steadiness in reality, yet they are steady in their own estimation, for they think that they will steadily obtain that which they hope for.

<p>In like manner, in reply to the Second Objection, we must observe that young people and men in drink are indeed unsteady in reality: but, in their own estimation, they are capable, for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not their shortcomings.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Not only experience, but also lack of experience, is, in some way, a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of hope, as explained above (05, ad 3).

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether hope is a cause of love?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that hope is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of love. Because, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei xiv, 7,9), love is the first of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> emotions. But hope is an emotion of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore love precedes hope, and consequently hope does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> love.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, desire precedes hope. But desire is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by love, as stated above (Question 25, Article 2). Therefore hope, too, follows love, and consequently is not its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, hope <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> pleasure, as stated above (Question 32, Article 3). But pleasure is only of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that is loved. Therefore love precedes hope.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse2">Matthew 1:2</a>, "<a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> begot <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> begot <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>," says, i.e. "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> begets hope, and hope begets <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>." But <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is love. Therefore love is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by hope.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Hope can regard two things. For it regards as its object, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which one hopes for. But since the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> we hope for is something difficult but possible to obtain; and since it happens sometimes that what is difficult becomes possible to us, not through ourselves but through others; hence it is that hope regards also that by which something becomes possible to us.

<p>In so far, then, as hope regards the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> we hope to get, it is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by love: since we do not hope save for that which we desire and love. But in so far as hope regards one through whom something becomes possible to us, love is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by hope, and not vice versa. Because by the very fact that we hope that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will accrue to us through someone, we are moved towards him as to our own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and thus we begin to love him. Whereas from the fact that we love someone we do not hope in him, except <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, that is, in so far as we think that he returns our love. Wherefore the fact of being loved by another makes us hope in him; but our love for him is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the hope we have in him.

<p>Wherefore the Replies to the Objections are evident.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether hope is a help or a hindrance to action?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that hope is not a help but a hindrance to action. Because hope implies security. But security begets negligence which hinders action. Therefore hope is a hindrance to action.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, sorrow hinders action, as stated above (Question 37, Article 3). But hope sometimes <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> sorrow: for it is written (<a href="../bible/pro013.htm#verse12">Proverbs 13:12</a>): "Hope that is deferred afflicteth the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>." Therefore hope hinders action.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> is contrary to <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>). But <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, especially in matters of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, conduces to action; for it is written (<a href="../bible/2sa002.htm#verse26">2 Samuel 2:26</a>), that "it is dangerous to drive people to <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>." Therefore hope has a contrary effect, namely, by hindering action.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse10">1 Corinthians 9:10</a>) that "he that plougheth should plough in hope . . . to receive fruit": and the same applies to all other actions.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Hope of its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is a help to action by making it more intense: and this for two reasons. First, by reason of its object, which is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, difficult but possible. For the thought of its being difficult arouses our attention; while the thought that it is possible is no drag on our effort. Hence it follows that by reason of hope <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is intent on his action. Secondly, on account of its effect. Because hope, as stated above (Question 32, Article 3), <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> pleasure; which is a help to action, as stated above (Question 33, Article 4). Therefore hope is conducive to action.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Hope regards a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to be obtained; security regards an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to be avoided. Wherefore security seems to be contrary to fear rather than to belong to hope. Yet security does not beget negligence, save in so far as it lessens the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of difficulty: whereby it also lessens the character of hope: for the things in which a man <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> no hindrance, are no longer looked upon as difficult.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Hope of itself <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> pleasure; it is by <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> that it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> sorrow, as stated above (32, 3, ad 2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Despair threatens danger in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, on account of a certain hope that attaches to it. For they who <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> of flight, strive less to fly, but hope to avenge their death: and therefore in this hope they fight the more bravely, and consequently <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> dangerous to the foe.
