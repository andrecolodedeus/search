<h1>Question 40. The persons as compared to the relations or properties</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1040.htm#article1"> Is relation the same as person?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1040.htm#article2"> Do the relations distinguish and constitute the persons?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1040.htm#article3"> Do mental abstraction of the relations from the persons leave the hypostases distinct?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1040.htm#article4"> According to our mode of understanding, do the relations presuppose the acts of the persons, or contrariwise?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether relation is the same as person?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> relation is not the same as <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. For when things are identical, if one is multiplied the others are multiplied. But in one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> there are several relations; as in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Father there is paternity and common spiration. Again, one relation <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, as common spiration in the Father and in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. Therefore relation is not the same as <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Phys. iv, text. 24), nothing is contained by itself. But relation is in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; nor can it be said that this occurs because they are identical, for otherwise relation would be also in the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Therefore relation, or property, is not the same as <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, when several things are identical, what is predicated of one is predicated of the others. But all that is predicated of a Person is not predicated of His property. For we say that the Father begets; but not that the paternity is begetting. Therefore property is not the same as <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "what is" and "whereby it is" are the same, according to <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> (De Hebdom.). But the Father is Father by paternity. In the same way, the other properties are the same as the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Different opinions have been held on this point. Some have said that the properties are not the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, nor in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; and these have thought thus owing to the mode of signification of the relations, which do not indeed signify <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> "in" something, but rather <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> "towards" something. Whence, they styled the relations "assistant," as above explained (28, 2). But since relation, considered as really <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> Itself, and the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is the same as <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, as appears from what was said above (Question 39, Article 1), relation must <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> be the same as <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p>Others, therefore, considering this identity, said that the properties were indeed the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; but not "in" the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; for, they said, there are no properties in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> except in our way of speaking, as stated above (Question 32, Article 2). We must, however, say that there are properties in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; as we have shown (32, 2). These are designated by abstract terms, being forms, as it were, of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. So, since the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a form requires it to be "in" that of which it is the form, we must say that the properties are in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and yet that they are the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; as we say that the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and yet is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Person and property are really the same, but differ in concept. Consequently, it does not follow that if one is multiplied, the other must also be multiplied. We must, however, consider that in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by reason of the divine simplicity, a twofold real identity <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> as regards what in creatures are distinct. For, since the divine simplicity excludes the composition of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, it follows that in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the abstract is the same as the concrete, as "Godhead" and "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." And as the divine simplicity excludes the composition of subject and <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, it follows that whatever is attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> Itself; and so, wisdom and power are the same in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because they are both in the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. According to this twofold identity, property in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. For personal properties are the same as the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> because the abstract and the concrete are the same in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; since they are the subsisting <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> themselves, as paternity is the Father Himself, and filiation is the Son, and procession is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. But the non-personal properties are the same as the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> according to the other reason of identity, whereby whatever is attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is His own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Thus, common spiration is the same as the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Father, and the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Son; not that it is one self-subsisting <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; but that as there is one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> in the two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, so also there is one property in the two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, as above explained (30, 2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The properties are said to be in the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, only by mode of identity; but in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> they <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> by mode of identity, not merely in reality, but also in the mode of signification; as the form <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in its subject. Thus the properties determine and distinguish the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, but not the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Notional participles and verbs signify the notional acts: and acts belong to a "suppositum." Now, properties are not designated as "supposita," but as forms of "supposita." And so their mode of signification is against notional participles and verbs being predicated of the properties.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the persons are distinguished by the relations?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are not distinguished by the relations. For simple things are distinct by themselves. But the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are supremely simple. Therefore they are distinguished by themselves, and not by the relation.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a form is distinguished only in relation to its genus. For white is distinguished from black only by <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>. But "hypostasis" signifies an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> in the genus of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Therefore the hypostases cannot be distinguished by relations.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, what is absolute comes before what is relative. But the distinction of the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is the primary distinction. Therefore the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are not distinguished by the relations.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, whatever presupposes distinction cannot be the first principle of distinction. But relation presupposes distinction, which comes into its definition; for a relation is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> what is towards another. Therefore the first distinctive principle in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be relation.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Trin.): "Relation alone multiplies the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> of the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In whatever multitude of things is to be found something common to all, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to seek out the principle of distinction. So, as the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> agree in the unity of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, we must seek to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the principle of distinction whereby they are several. Now, there are two principles of difference between the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and these are "origin" and "relation." Although these do not really differ, yet they differ in the mode of signification; for "origin" is signified by way of act, as "generation"; and "relation" by way of the form, as "paternity."

<p>Some, then, considering that relation follows upon act, have said that the divine hypostases are distinguished by origin, so that we may say that the Father is distinguished from the Son, inasmuch as the former begets and the latter is begotten. Further, that the relations, or the properties, make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the distinctions of the hypostases or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> as resulting therefrom; as also in creatures the properties manifest the distinctions of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, which distinctions are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the material principles.

<p>This opinion, however, cannot stand--for two reasons.

<p>Firstly, because, in order that two things be understood as distinct, their distinction must be understood as resulting from something intrinsic to both; thus in things <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> it results from their <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> or their form. Now origin of a thing does not designate anything intrinsic, but means the way from something, or to something; as generation signifies the way to a thing generated, and as proceeding from the generator. Hence it is not possible that what is generated and the generator should be distinguished by generation alone; but in the generator and in the thing generated we must presuppose whatever makes them to be distinguished from each other. In a divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> there is nothing to presuppose but <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, and relation or property. Whence, since the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> agree in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, it only remains to be said that the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are distinguished from each other by the relations.

<p>Secondly: because the distinction of the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is not to be so understood as if what is common to them all is divided, because the common <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> remains undivided; but the distinguishing principles themselves must constitute the things which are distinct. Now the relations or the properties distinguish or constitute the hypostases or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, inasmuch as they are themselves the subsisting <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; as paternity is the Father, and filiation is the Son, because in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the abstract and the concrete do not differ. But it is against the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of origin that it should constitute hypostasis or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. For origin taken in an active sense signifies proceeding from a subsisting <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, so that it presupposes the latter; while in a passive sense origin, as "nativity," signifies the way to a subsisting <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and as not yet constituting the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p>It is therefore better to say that the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> or hypostases are distinguished rather by relations than by origin. For, although in both ways they are distinguished, nevertheless in our mode of understanding they are distinguished chiefly and firstly by relations; whence this name "Father" signifies not only a property, but also the hypostasis; whereas this term "Begetter" or "Begetting" signifies property only; forasmuch as this name "Father" signifies the relation which is distinctive and constitutive of the hypostasis; and this term "Begetter" or "Begotten" signifies the origin which is not distinctive and constitutive of the hypostasis.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are the subsisting relations themselves. Hence it is not against the simplicity of the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> for them to be distinguished by the relations.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are not distinguished as regards being, in which they subsist, nor in anything absolute, but only as regards something relative. Hence relation suffices for their distinction.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The more prior a distinction is, the nearer it approaches to unity; and so it must be the least possible distinction. So the distinction of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> must be by that which distinguishes the least possible; and this is by relation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Relation presupposes the distinction of the subjects, when it is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>; but when the relation is subsistent, it does not presuppose, but brings about distinction. For when it is said that relation is by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to be towards another, the word "another" signifies the correlative which is not prior, but simultaneous in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the hypostases remain if the relations are mentally abstracted from the persons?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the hypostases remain if the properties or relations are <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mentally</a> abstracted from the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. For that to which something is added, may be understood when the addition is taken away; as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is something added to animal which can be understood if rational be taken away. But <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is something added to hypostasis; for <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is "a hypostasis distinguished by a property of dignity." Therefore, if a personal property be taken away from a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, the hypostasis remains.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that the Father is Father, and that He is someone, are not due to the same reason. For as He is the Father by paternity, supposing He is some one by paternity, it would follow that the Son, in Whom there is not paternity, would not be "someone." So when paternity is <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mentally</a> abstracted from the Father, He still remains "someone"--that is, a hypostasis. Therefore, if property be removed from <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, the hypostasis remains.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. v, 6): "Unbegotten is not the same as Father; for if the Father had not begotten the Son, nothing would prevent Him being called unbegotten." But if He had not begotten the Son, there would be no paternity in Him. Therefore, if paternity be removed, there still remains the hypostasis of the Father as unbegotten.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (De Trin. iv): "The Son has nothing else than birth." But He is Son by "birth." Therefore, if filiation be removed, the Son's hypostasis no more remains; and the same holds as regards the other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Abstraction by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is twofold--when the universal is abstracted from the particular, as animal abstracted from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; and when the form is abstracted from the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as the form of a circle is abstracted by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> from any sensible <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. The difference between these two abstractions consists in the fact that in the abstraction of the universal from the particular, that from which the abstraction is made does not remain; for when the difference of rationality is removed from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> no longer remains in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, but animal alone remains. But in the abstraction of the form from the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, both the form and the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> remain in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; as, for instance, if we abstract the form of a circle from brass, there remains in our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> separately the understanding both of a circle, and of brass. Now, although there is no universal nor particular in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor form and <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, in reality; nevertheless, as regards the mode of signification there is a certain likeness of these things in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and thus <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 6) that "<a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is common and hypostasis is particular." So, if we speak of the abstraction of the universal from the particular, the common universal <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> remains in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> if the properties are removed; but not the hypostasis of the Father, which is, as it were, a particular.

<p>But as regards the abstraction of the form from the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, if the non-personal properties are removed, then the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the hypostases and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> remains; as, for instance, if the fact of the Father's being unbegotten or spirating be <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mentally</a> abstracted from the Father, the Father's hypostasis or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> remains.

<p>If, however, the personal property be <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mentally</a> abstracted, the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the hypostasis no longer remains. For the personal properties are not to be understood as added to the divine hypostases, as a form is added to a pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> subject: but they carry with them their own "supposita," inasmuch as they are themselves subsisting <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; thus paternity is the Father Himself. For hypostasis signifies something distinct in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since hypostasis means an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. So, as relation distinguishes and constitutes the hypostases, as above explained (2), it follows that if the personal relations are <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mentally</a> abstracted, the hypostases no longer remain. Some, however, think, as above noted, that the divine hypostases are not distinguished by the relations, but only by origin; so that the Father is a hypostasis as not from another, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is a hypostasis as from another by generation. And that the consequent relations which are to be regarded as properties of dignity, constitute the notion of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and are thus called "personal properties." Hence, if these relations are <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mentally</a> abstracted, the hypostasis, but not the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, remain.

<p>But this is impossible, for two reasons: first, because the relations distinguish and constitute the hypostases, as shown above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>); secondly, because every hypostasis of a rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, as appears from the definition of <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> (De Duab. Nat.) that, "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of a rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." Hence, to have hypostasis and not <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, it would be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to abstract the rationality from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but not the property from the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Person does not add to hypostasis a distinguishing property absolutely, but a distinguishing property of dignity, all of which must be taken as the difference. Now, this distinguishing property is one of dignity precisely because it is understood as subsisting in a rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence, if the distinguishing property be removed from the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, the hypostasis no longer remains; whereas it would remain were the rationality of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> removed; for both <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and hypostasis are <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. Consequently, in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the distinguishing relation belongs <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> to both.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> By paternity the Father is not only Father, but is a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and is "someone," or a hypostasis. It does not follow, however, that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is not "someone" or a hypostasis; just as it does not follow that He is not a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> does not mean to say that the hypostasis of the Father would remain as unbegotten, if His paternity were removed, as if innascibility constituted and distinguished the hypostasis of the Father; for this would be impossible, since "being unbegotten" says nothing positive and is only a negation, as he himself says. But he speaks in a general sense, forasmuch as not every unbegotten being is the Father. So, if paternity be removed, the hypostasis of the Father does not remain in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as distinguished from the other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, but only as distinguished from creatures; as the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> understand it.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the properties presuppose the notional acts?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the notional acts are understood before the properties. For the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master of the Sentences</a> says (Sent. i, D, xxvii) that "the Father always is, because He is ever begetting the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>." So it seems that generation precedes paternity in the order of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in the order of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> every relation presupposes that on which it is founded; as equality presupposes <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. But paternity is a relation founded on the action of generation. Therefore paternity presupposes generation.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, active generation is to paternity as nativity is to filiation. But filiation presupposes nativity; for the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is so called because He is born. Therefore paternity also presupposes generation.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Generation is the operation of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Father. But paternity constitutes the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Father. Therefore in the order of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>, paternity is prior to generation.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to the opinion that the properties do not distinguish and constitute the hypostases in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but only manifest them as already distinct and constituted, we must absolutely say that the relations in our mode of understanding follow upon the notional acts, so that we can say, without qualifying the phrase, that "because He begets, He is the Father." A distinction, however, is needed if we suppose that the relations distinguish and constitute the divine hypostases. For origin has in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> an active and passive signification--active, as generation is attributed to the Father, and spiration, taken for the notional act, is attributed to the Father and the Son; passive, as nativity is attributed to the Son, and procession to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. For, in the order of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>, origin, in the passive sense, simply precedes the personal properties of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> proceeding; because origin, as passively understood, signifies the way to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> constituted by the property. Likewise, origin signified actively is prior in the order of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> to the non-personal relation of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> originating; as the notional act of spiration precedes, in the order of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>, the unnamed relative property common to the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. The personal property of the Father can be considered in a twofold sense: firstly, as a relation; and thus again in the order of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> it presupposes the notional act, for relation, as such, is founded upon an act: secondly, according as it constitutes the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; and thus the notional act presupposes the relation, as an action presupposes a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> acting.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> When the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> says that "because He begets, He is Father," the term "Father" is taken as meaning relation only, but not as signifying the subsisting <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; for then it would be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to say conversely that because He is Father He begets.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This objection avails of paternity as a relation, but not as constituting a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Nativity is the way to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Son; and so, in the order of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>, it precedes filiation, even as constituting the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. But active generation signifies a proceeding from the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Father; wherefore it presupposes the personal property of the Father.
