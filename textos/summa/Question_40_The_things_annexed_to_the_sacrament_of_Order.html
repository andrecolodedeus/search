<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether those who are ordained ought to wear the tonsure?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that those who are ordained ought not to wear the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> in the shape of a crown. For the Lord threatened captivity and dispersion to those who were shaven in this way: "Of the captivity of the bare head of the enemies" (<a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse42">Deuteronomy 32:42</a>), and: "I will scatter into every wind them that have their hair cut round" (<a href="../bible/jer049.htm#verse32">Jeremiah 49:32</a>). Now the ministers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should not be captives, but free. Therefore shaving and <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> in the shape of a crown does not become them.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> should correspond to the figure. Now the crown was prefigured in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> by the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> of the Nazarenes, as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 24). Therefore since the Nazarenes were not ordained to the Divine ministry, it would seem that the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should not receive the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> or shave the head in the form of a crown. The same would seem to follow from the fact that lay brothers, who are not ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, receive a <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> in the religious Orders.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the hair signifies superabundance, because it grows from that which is superabundant. But the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should cast off all superabundance. Therefore they should shave the head completely and not in the shape of a crown.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, "to serve <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is to reign" (Super <a href="../bible/psa101.htm#verse23">Psalm 101:23</a>). Now a crown is the sign of royalty. Therefore a crown is becoming to those who are devoted to the Divine ministry.

<p>Further, according to <a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse15">1 Corinthians 11:15</a>, hair is given us "for a covering." But the ministers of the altar should have the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> uncovered. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> is becoming to them.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is becoming for those who apply themselves to the Divine ministry to be shaven or tonsured in the form of a crown by reason of the shape. Because a crown is the sign of royalty; and of perfection, since it is circular; and those who are appointed to the Divine service acquire a royal dignity and ought to be perfect in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. It is also becoming to them as it involves the hair being taken both from the higher part of the head by shaving, lest their mind be hindered by temporal occupations from contemplating Divine things, and from the lower part by clipping, lest their senses be entangled in temporal things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The Lord threatens those who did this for the worship of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The things that were done in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> represent imperfectly the things of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. Hence things pertaining to the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> were signified not only by the offices of the Levites, but also by all those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who professed some degree of perfection. Now the Nazarenes professed a certain perfection by having their hair cut off, thus signifying their contempt of temporal things, although they did not have it cut in the shape of a crown, but cut it off completely, for as yet it was not the time of the royal and perfect <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. In like manner lay brothers have their hair cut because they renounce temporalities. but they do not shave the head, because they are not occupied in the Divine ministry, so as to have to contemplate Divine things with the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Not only the renunciation of temporalities, but also the royal dignity has to be signified by the form of a crown; wherefore the hair should not be cut off entirely. Another reason is that this would be unbecoming.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the tonsure is an Order?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> is an Order. For in the acts of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> corresponds to the corporal. Now the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> is a corporal sign employed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Therefore seemingly there is some interior signification corresponding thereto; so that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> receives a character when he receives the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a>, and consequently the latter is an Order.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as Confirmation and the other Orders are given by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> alone, so is the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a>. Now a character is imprinted in Confirmation, and the other Orders. Therefore one is imprinted likewise in receiving the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a>. Therefore the same conclusion follows.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, Order denotes a degree of dignity. Now a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> by the very fact of being a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> is placed on a degree above the people. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> by which he is made a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> is an Order.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> No Order is given except during the celebration of Mass. But the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> is given even outside the office of the Mass. Therefore it is not an Order.

<p>Further, in the conferring of every Order mention is made of some power granted, but not in the conferring of the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a>. Therefore it is not an Order.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are severed from the people in order that they may give themselves entirely to the Divine worship. Now in the Divine worship are certain actions that have to be exercised by virtue of certain definite powers, and for this purpose the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power of order is given; while other actions are performed by the whole body of ministers in common, for instance the recital of the Divine praises. For such things it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to have the power of Order, but only to be deputed to such an office; and this is done by the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a>. Consequently it is not an Order but a preamble to Orders.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> has some <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> thing inwardly corresponding to it, as signate corresponds to sign; but this is not a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power. Wherefore a character is not imprinted in the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> as in an Order.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although a man does not receive a character in the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a>, nevertheless he is appointed to the Divine worship. Hence this appointment should be made by the supreme minister, namely the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who moreover blesses the <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a> and vessels and whatsoever else is employed in the Divine worship.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> through being a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> is in a higher state than a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>; but as regards power he has not the higher degree that is required for Orders.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether by receiving the tonsure a man renounces temporal goods?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that men renounce temporal goods by receiving the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a>, for when they are tonsured they say: "The Lord is the portion of my inheritance." But as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (Ep. ad Nepot.), "the Lord disdains to be made a portion together with these temporal things." Therefore he renounces temporalities.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> ought to abound more than that of the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse20">Matthew 5:20</a>). But the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, namely the Levites, did not receive a portion of inheritance with their brethren (<a href="../bible/deu010.htm">Deuteronomy 10</a>; <a href="../bible/deu018.htm">Deuteronomy 18</a>). Therefore neither should the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, Hugh says (De Sacram. ii) that "after a man is made a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>, he must from thenceforward live on the pay of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>." But this would not be so were he to retain his patrimony. Therefore he would seem to renounce it by becoming a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremias</a> was of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> order (<a href="../bible/jer001.htm#verse1">Jeremiah 1:1</a>). Yet he retained possession of his inheritance (<a href="../bible/jer032.htm#verse8">Jeremiah 32:8</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> can retain their patrimony.

<p>Further, if this were not so there would seem to be no difference between religious and the secular clergy.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Clerics by receiving the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a>, do not renounce their patrimony or other temporalities; since the possession of earthly things is not contrary to the Divine worship to which <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> are appointed, although excessive care for such things is; for as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. x, 30), "it is not <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> but the love of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> that is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 11.</strong> The Lord disdains to be a portion as being loved equally with other things, so that a man place his end in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the things of the world. He does not, however, disdain to be the portion of those who so possess the things of the world as not to be withdrawn thereby from the Divine worship.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> the Levites had a right to their paternal inheritance; and the reason why they did not receive a portion with the other tribes was because they were scattered throughout all the tribes, which would have been impossible if, like the other tribes, they had received one fixed portion of the soil.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Clerics promoted to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> orders, if they be poor, must be provided for by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who ordained them; otherwise he is not so bound. And they are bound to minister to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the Order they have received. The words of Hugh refer to those who have no means of livelihood.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether above the priestly Order there ought to be an episcopal power?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there ought not to be an <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> power above the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> Order. For as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 24) "the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> Order originated from <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>." Now in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> there was no one above <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>. Therefore neither in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> ought there to be any power above that of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, powers rank according to acts. Now no sacred act can be greater than to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, whereunto the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> power is directed. Therefore there should not be an <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> above the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> power.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, in offering, represents <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, Who offered Himself for us to the Father. Now no one is above <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, since He is the Head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Therefore there should not be an <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> above the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> power.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A power is so much the higher according as it extends to more things. Now the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> power, according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Eccl. Hier. v), extends only to cleansing and enlightening, whereas the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> power extends both to this and to perfecting. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> should be above the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> power.

<p>Further, the Divine ministries should be more orderly than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> ministries. Now the order of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> ministries requires that in each office there should be one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to preside, just as a general is placed over soldiers. Therefore there should also be appointed over <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> one who is the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and this is the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> should be above the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> power.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> has two acts: one is the principal, namely to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. the other is secondary, namely to prepare <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> people for the reception of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as stated above (37, 2,4). As regards the first act, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> power does not depend on a higher power save <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a>; but as to the second, it depends on a higher and that a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> power. For every power that cannot exercise its act without certain ordinances, depends on the power that makes those ordinances. Now a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> cannot loose and bind, except we presuppose him to have the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of authority, whereby those whom he absolves are subject to him. But he can <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> any <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> determined by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, nor is anything else required for the validity of the sacrament; although, on account of a certain congruousness, the act of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is pre-required in the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the altar, <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a>, and so forth. Hence it is clear that it behooves the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> to be above the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> power, as regards the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> secondary act, but not as regards his primary act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> was both <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and pontiff, that is chief priest. Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> power originated from him, in so far as he was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> offering <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, which was lawful even to the lesser <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>; but it does not originate from him as pontiff, by which power he was able to do certain things; for instance, to enter once a year the Holy of Holies, which it was unlawful for the other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to do.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> There is no higher power with regard to this act, but with regard to another, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Just as the perfections of all <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as their exemplar, so was <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the exemplar of all ecclesiastical offices. Wherefore each minister of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is, in some respect, a copy of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 24). Yet he is the higher who represents <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> according to a greater perfection. Now a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> represents <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in that He fulfilled a certain ministry by Himself, whereas a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> represents Him in that He instituted other ministers and founded the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Hence it belongs to a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicate</a> a thing to the Divine offices, as establishing the Divine worship after the manner of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For this reason also a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is especially called the bridegroom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> even as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the episcopate is an Order?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopate</a> is an Order. First of all, because <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Eccl. Hier. v) assigns these three orders to the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical hierarchy</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and the minister. In the text also (Sent. iv, D, 24) it is stated that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> Order is fourfold.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, Order is nothing else but a degree of power in the dispensing of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things. Now <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> can dispense certain <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> cannot dispense, namely Confirmation and Order. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopate</a> is an Order.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> there is no <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power other than of Order or <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. But things pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> power are not matters of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, else they might be committed to one who is not a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Therefore they belong to the power of Order. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has an Order which a simple <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> has not; and thus the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopate</a> is an Order.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> One Order does not depend on a preceding order as regards the validity of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> power depends on the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> power, since no one can receive the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> power unless he have previously the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> power. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopate</a> is not an Order.

<p>Further, the greater Orders are not conferred except on Saturdays [The four Ember Saturdays]. But the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> power is bestowed on Sundays [Dist. lxxv, can. Ordinationes]. Therefore it is not an Order.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Order may be understood in two ways. In one way as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, and thus, as already stated (37, 2,4), every Order is directed to the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>. Wherefore since the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has not a higher power than the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, in this respect the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopate</a> is not an Order. In another way Order may be considered as an office in relation to certain sacred actions: and thus since in <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchical</a> actions a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has in relation to the <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">mystical body</a> a higher power than the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopate</a> is an Order. It is in this sense that the authorities quoted speak.

<p>Hence the Reply to the First Objection is clear.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Order considered as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> which imprints a character is specially directed to the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, in which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself is contained, because by a character we are made like to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself [Cf. III, 63, 3]. Hence although at his promotion a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> receives a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power in respect of certain <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, this power nevertheless has not the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a character. For this reason the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopate</a> is not an Order, in the sense in which an Order is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> power is one not only of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> but also of Order, as stated above, taking Order in the sense in which it is generally understood.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether in the Church there can be anyone above the bishops?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there cannot be anyone in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> higher than the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. For all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are the successors of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. Now the power so given to one of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, namely Peter (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse19">Matthew 16:19</a>), was given to all the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse23">John 20:23</a>). Therefore all <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are equal, and one is not above another.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the rite of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> ought to be more conformed to the Jewish rite than to that of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. Now the distinction of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> dignity and the appointment of one over another, were introduced by the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 24); and there was no such thing in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. Therefore neither in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> be above another.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a higher power cannot be conferred by a lower, nor equal by equal, because "without all contradiction that which is less is blessed by the greater [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'better']"; hence a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> does not <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, but a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> consecrates a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. But a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> can <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, since even the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Ostia consecrates the Pope. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> dignity is equal in all matters, and consequently one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> should not be subject to another, as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 24).

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> We read in the council of Constantinople: "In accordance with the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> and the statutes and definitions of the canons, we venerate the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of ancient Rome the first and greatest of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and after him the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Constantinople." Therefore one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is above another.

<p>Further, the blessed Cyril, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria, says: "That we may remain members of our apostolic head, the throne of the Roman Pontiffs, of whom it is our <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to seek what we are to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and what we are to hold, venerating him, beseeching him above others; for his it is to reprove, to correct, to appoint, to loose, and to bind in place of Him Who set up that very throne, and Who gave the fulness of His own to no other, but to him alone, to whom by divine right all bow the head, and the primates of the world are obedient as to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> Himself." Therefore <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are subject to someone even by divine right.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Wherever there are several authorities directed to one purpose, there must needs be one universal authority over the particular authorities, because in all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and acts the order is according to the order of their ends (Ethic. i, 1,2). Now the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is more Godlike than the particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Wherefore above the governing power which aims at a particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> there must be a universal governing power in respect of the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, otherwise there would be no cohesion towards the one object. Hence since the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is one body, it behooves, if this oneness is to be preserved, that there be a governing power in respect of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, above the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> power whereby each particular Church is governed, and this is the power of the Pope. Consequently those who deny this power are called schismatics as <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> a division in the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Again, between a simple <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the Pope there are other degrees of rank corresponding to the degrees of union, in respect of which one congregation or community includes another; thus the community of a province includes the community of a city, and the community of a kingdom includes the community of one province, and the community of the whole world includes the community of one kingdom.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although the power of binding and loosing was given to all the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> in common, nevertheless in order to indicate some order in this power, it was given first of all to Peter alone, to show that this power must come down from him to the others. For this reason He said to him in the singular: "Confirm thy brethren" (<a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse32">Luke 22:32</a>), and: "Feed My sheep" (<a href="../bible/joh021.htm#verse17">John 21:17</a>), i.e. according to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>: "Be thou the president and head of thy brethren in My stead, that they, putting thee in My place, may preach and confirm thee throughout the world whilst thou sittest on thy throne."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The Jewish rite was not spread abroad in various kingdoms and provinces, but was confined to one nation; hence there was no need to distinguish various pontiffs under the one who had the chief power. But the rite of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, like that of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, is spread abroad through various <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>; and consequently in this respect it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the constitution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to be like the rite of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> rather than that of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> power is surpassed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> power, as by a power of a different kind; but the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> is surpassed by the papal power as by a power of the same kind. Hence a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> can perform every <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchical</a> act that the Pope can; whereas a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> cannot perform every act that a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> can in conferring the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Wherefore as regards matters pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> Order, all <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are equal, and for this reason any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> can <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> another <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the vestments of the ministers are fittingly instituted in the Church?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a> of the ministers are not fittingly instituted in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> are more bound to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> than were the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. Now among the <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> there were the breeches as a sign of chastity. Much more therefore should they have a place among the <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> ministers.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> is more worthy than the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of the Old. But the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> had <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitres</a>, which are a sign of dignity. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> should also have them.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is nearer than the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> Order to the Orders of ministers. Now the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> uses the <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a> of the ministers, namely the <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon's</a> <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestment</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15087a.htm">tunic</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>'s. Much more therefore should simple <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> use them.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> the pontiff wore the <a href="../cathen/05497a.htm">ephod</a> [Superhumerale, i.e. over-the-shoulders], which signified the burden of the Gospel, as <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> observes (De Tabernac. iii). Now this is especially incumbent on our pontiffs. Therefore they ought to wear the <a href="../cathen/05497a.htm">ephod</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, "Doctrine and Truth" were inscribed on the "rational" which the pontiffs of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> wore. Now <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> was made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> especially in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>. Therefore it is becoming to the pontiffs of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, the golden plate on which was written the most admirable name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was the most admirable of the adornments of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. Therefore it should especially have been transferred to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 7.</strong> Further, the things which the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> wear outwardly are signs of inward power. Now the archbishop has no other kind of power than a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, as stated above (<a href="#6">Article 6</a>). Therefore he should not have the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> which other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have not.

<p><strong>Objection 8.</strong> Further, the fulness of power resides in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a>. But he has not a <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crozier</a>. Therefore other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should not have one.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a> of the ministers denote the qualifications required of them for handling Divine things. And since certain things are required of all, and some are required of the higher, that are not so exacted of the lower ministers, therefore certain <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a> are common to all the ministers, while some pertain to the higher ministers only. Accordingly it is becoming to all the ministers to wear the "<a href="../cathen/01428c.htm">amice</a>" which covers the shoulders, thereby signifying <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> in the exercise of the Divine offices to which they are deputed; and the "<a href="../cathen/01251b.htm">alb</a>," which signifies a pure life, and the "girdle," which signifies restraint of the flesh. But the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> wears in addition the "<a href="../cathen/09601b.htm">maniple</a>" on the left arm; this signifies the wiping away of the least stains, since a <a href="../cathen/09601b.htm">maniple</a> is a kind of handkerchief for wiping the face; for they are the first to be admitted to the handling of sacred things. They also have the "narrow <a href="../cathen/15087a.htm">tunic</a>," signifying the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; wherefore in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> little bells hung therefrom, and <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a> are the first admitted to announce the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> has in addition the "stole" over the left shoulder, as a sign that he is deputed to a ministry in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> themselves, and the "<a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a>" (which is a full <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestment</a>, so called because it first came into use in <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a>), to signify that he is the first to be appointed to dispense the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>: for he dispenses the blood, and in dispensing one should be generous.

<p>But in the case of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> the "stole" hangs from both shoulders, to show that he has received full power to dispense the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and not as the minister of another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, for which reason the stole reaches right down. He also wears the "chasuble", which signifies <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, because he it is who consecrates the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, namely the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Eucharist</a>.

<p>Bishops have nine ornaments besides those which the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> has; these are the "<a href="../cathen/03087b.htm">stockings</a>, <a href="../cathen/13434a.htm">sandals</a>, <a href="../cathen/03776a.htm">succinctory</a>, <a href="../cathen/15087a.htm">tunic</a>, <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a>, <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a>, <a href="../cathen/06589a.htm">gloves</a>, <a href="../cathen/13059a.htm">ring</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crozier</a>," because there are nine things which they can, but <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> cannot, do, namely ordain <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, impose hands, <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicate</a> churches, depose <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, celebrate synods, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>, <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a> and vessels.

<p>We may also say that the <a href="../cathen/03087b.htm">"stockings"</a> signify his upright walk; the <a href="../cathen/13434a.htm">"sandals"</a> which cover the feet, his contempt of earthly things; the <a href="../cathen/03776a.htm">"succinctory"</a> which girds the <a href="../cathen/14301a.htm">stole</a> with the <a href="../cathen/01251b.htm">alb</a>, his love of probity; the <a href="../cathen/15087a.htm">"tunic"</a>, perseverance, for <a href="../cathen/08520a.htm">Joseph</a> is said (<a href="../bible/gen037.htm#verse23">Genesis 37:23</a>) to have had a long <a href="../cathen/15087a.htm">tunic</a>--"talaric," because it reached down to the ankles [talos], which denote the end of life; the <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">"dalmatic"</a>, generosity in <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">works of mercy</a>; the <a href="../cathen/06589a.htm">"gloves,"</a> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> in action; the <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">"mitre"</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of both Testaments, for which reason it has two crests; the <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">"crozier,"</a> his pastoral care, whereby he has to gather together the wayward (this is denoted by the curve at the head of the <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crozier</a>), to uphold the weak (this is denoted by the stem of the <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crozier</a>), and to spur on the laggards (this is denoted by the point at the foot of the <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crozier</a>). Hence the line: <blockquote> "Gather, uphold, spur on<br> The wayward, the weak, and the laggard." </blockquote> The <a href="../cathen/13059a.htm">"ring"</a> signifies the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> whereby the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is espoused to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are espoused to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the place of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Furthermore archbishops have the "<a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>" in sign of their privileged power, for it signifies the golden chain which those who fought rightfully were wont to receive.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> were enjoined <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a> only for the time of their attendance for the purpose of their ministry. Wherefore as a sign of the <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> which they had then to observe, they wore the breeches while offering <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. But the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> are enjoined perpetual <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a>; and so the comparison fails.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> was not a sign of dignity, for it was a kind of hat, as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (Ep. ad Fabiol.). But the diadem which was a sign of dignity was given to the pontiffs alone, as the <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> is now.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The power of the ministers resides in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> as their source, but not in the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, for he does not confer those Orders. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, rather than the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, wears those <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Instead of the <a href="../cathen/05497a.htm">ephod</a>, they wear the <a href="../cathen/14301a.htm">stole</a>, which is intended for the same signification as the <a href="../cathen/05497a.htm">ephod</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> takes the place of the <a href="../cathen/11600b.htm">"rational"</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> Instead of that <a href="../cathen/11600b.htm">plate</a> our pontiff wears the <a href="../cathen/11601a.htm">cross</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> says (De Myst. Miss. i), just as the breeches are replaced by the <a href="../cathen/13434a.htm">sandals</a>, the linen garment by the <a href="../cathen/01251b.htm">alb</a>, the belt by the girdle, the long or talaric garment by the <a href="../cathen/15087a.htm">tunic</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05497a.htm">ephod</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01428c.htm">amice</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11600b.htm">"rational"</a> by the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>, the diadem by the <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 7.</strong> Although he has not another kind of power he has the same power more fully. And so in order to designate this perfection, he receives the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> which surrounds him on all sides.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 8.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a> does not use a <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">pastoral staff</a> because Peter sent his to restore to life a certain disciple who afterwards became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Treves. Hence in the diocese of Treves the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a> carries a <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crozier</a> but not elsewhere; or else it is a sign of his not having a restricted power denoted by the curve of the staff.
