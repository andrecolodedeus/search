<h1>Question 41. Christ's temptation</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/4041.htm#article1"> Was it becoming that Christ should be tempted?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4041.htm#article2"> The place</a> <li><a href="../summa/4041.htm#article3"> The time</a> <li><a href="../summa/4041.htm#article4"> The mode and order of the temptation</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether it was becoming that Christ should be tempted?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it was not becoming for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be tempted. For to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> is to make an experiment, which is not done save in regard to something unknown. But the power of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> even to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; for it is written (<a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse41">Luke 4:41</a>) that "He suffered them not to speak, for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that He was <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." Therefore it seems that it was unbecoming for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be tempted.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was come in order to destroy the works of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse8">1 John 3:8</a>: "For this purpose the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> appeared, that He might destroy the works of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>." But it is not for the same to destroy the works of a certain one and to suffer them. Therefore it seems unbecoming that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should suffer Himself to be tempted by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> is from a threefold source--the flesh, the world, and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not tempted either by the flesh or by the world. Therefore neither should He have been tempted by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse1">Matthew 4:1</a>): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was led by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> into the desert to be tempted by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> wished to be tempted; first that He might strengthen us against <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says in a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> (xvi in Evang.): "It was not unworthy of our Redeemer to wish to be tempted, who came also to be slain; in order that by His <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> He might conquer our <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, just as by His death He overcame our death."

<p>Secondly, that we might be warned, so that none, however <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, may think himself safe or free from <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>. Wherefore also He wished to be tempted after His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, because, as <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (Super Matth., cap. iii.): "The <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> assail those principally who are sanctified, for he desires, above all, to overcome the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>. Hence also it is written (<a href="../bible/sir002.htm">Sirach 2</a>): Son, when thou comest to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, stand in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and in fear, and prepare thy <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> for <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>."

<p>Thirdly, in order to give us an example: to teach us, to wit, how to overcome the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iv) that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> "allowed Himself to be tempted" by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, "that He might be our Mediator in overcoming <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, not only by helping us, but also by giving us an example."

<p>Fourthly, in order to fill us with confidence in His mercy. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/heb004.htm#verse15">Hebrews 4:15</a>): "We have not a <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a>, who cannot have compassion on our infirmities, but one tempted in all things like as we are, without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei ix): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> only so far as He willed; not as the Author of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, but as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of certain temporal effects," from which they formed a certain conjecture that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. But since they also observed in Him certain signs of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> frailty, they did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> for certain that He was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>: wherefore (the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>) wished to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> Him. This is implied by the words of <a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse2">Matthew 4:2-3</a>, saying that, after "He was hungry, the tempter" came "to Him," because, as <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (Super Matth., cap. iii), "Had not <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> weakness in hungering betrayed His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> would not have dared to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> Him." Moreover, this appears from the very manner of the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, when he said: "If Thou be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>." Which words <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> explains as follows (In Luc. iv): "What means this way of addressing Him, save that, though he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was to come, yet he did not think that He had come in the weakness of the flesh?"

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> came to destroy the works of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, not by powerful <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, but rather by suffering from him and his members, so as to conquer the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> by righteousness, not by power; thus <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiii) that "the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> was to be overcome, not by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but by righteousness." And therefore in regard to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> we must consider what He did of His own will and what He suffered from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. For that He allowed Himself to be tempted was due to His own will. Wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse1">Matthew 4:1</a>): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was led by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> into the desert, to be tempted by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>"; and <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Hom. xvi in Evang.) says this is to be understood of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, to wit, that "thither did His Spirit lead Him, where the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> spirit would find Him and <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> Him." But He suffered from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> in being "taken up" on to "the pinnacle of the Temple" and again "into a very high mountain." Nor is it strange, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> observes, "that He allowed Himself to be taken by him on to a mountain, who allowed Himself to be crucified by His members." And we understand Him to have been taken up by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, not, as it were, by force, but because, as <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> says (Hom. xxi super Luc.), "He followed Him in the course of His <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> like a wrestler advancing of his own accord."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb004.htm#verse15">Hebrews 4:15</a>), <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> wished to be "tempted in all things, without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> which comes from an enemy can be without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: because it comes about by merely outward suggestion. But <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> which comes from the flesh cannot be without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because such a <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by pleasure and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>; and, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xix), "it is not without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that 'the flesh desireth against the spirit.'" And hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> wished to be tempted by an enemy, but not by the flesh.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether Christ should have been tempted in the desert?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should not have been tempted in the desert. Because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> wished to be tempted in order to give us an example, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). But an example should be set openly before those who are to follow it. Therefore He should not have been tempted in the desert.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. xii in Matth.): "Then most especially does the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> assail by <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempting</a> us, when he sees us alone. Thus did he <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in the beginning when he found her apart from her husband." Hence it seems that, by going into the desert to be tempted, He exposed Himself to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>. Since, therefore, His <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> is an example to us, it seems that others too should take such steps as will lead them into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>. And yet this seems a dangerous thing to do, since rather should we avoid the occasion of being tempted.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse5">Matthew 4:5</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> second <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> is set down, in which "the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> took" <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> up "into the Holy City, and set Him upon the pinnacle of the Temple": which is certainly not in the desert. Therefore He was not tempted in the desert only.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mar001.htm#verse13">Mark 1:13</a>) that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> "was in the desert forty days and forty nights, and was tempted by Satan."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1, ad 2), <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> of His own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> exposed Himself to be tempted by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, just as by His own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> He submitted to be killed by His members; else the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> would not have dared to approach Him. Now the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> prefers to assail a man who is alone, for, as it is written (<a href="../bible/ecc004.htm#verse12">Ecclesiastes 4:12</a>), "if a man prevail against one, two shall withstand him." And so it was that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> went out into the desert, as to a field of battle, to be tempted there by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says on <a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse1">Luke 4:1</a>, that "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was led into the desert for the purpose of provoking the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. For had he," i.e. the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, "not fought, He," i.e. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, "would not have conquered." He adds other reasons, saying that "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in doing this set forth the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam's</a> delivery from exile," who had been expelled from paradise into the desert, and "set an example to us, by showing that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> envies those who strive for better things."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is set as an example to all through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, according to <a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse2">Hebrews 12:2</a>: "Looking on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the author and finisher of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as it is written (<a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse17">Romans 10:17</a>), "cometh by hearing," but not by seeing: nay, it is even said (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse29">John 20:29</a>): "Blessed are they that have not seen and have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>." And therefore, in order that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> might be an example to us, it behooved that men should not see it, and it was enough that they should hear it related.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The occasions of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> are twofold. one is on the part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>--for instance, when a man <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> himself to be near to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by not avoiding the occasion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>. And such occasions of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> should be avoided, as it is written of Lot (<a href="../bible/gen019.htm#verse17">Genesis 19:17</a>): "Neither stay thou in all the country about" Sodom.

<p>Another occasion of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> is on the part of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, who always "envies those who strive for better things," as <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (In Luc. iv, 1). And such occasions of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> are not to be avoided. Hence <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. v in Matth. [From the supposititious Opus Imperfectum): "Not only <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was led into the desert by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, but all <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> children that have the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. For it is not enough for them to sit idle; the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> urges them to endeavor to do something great: which is for them to be in the desert from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> standpoint, for no unrighteousness, in which the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> delights, is there. Again, every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work, compared to the flesh and the world, is the desert; because it is not according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the flesh and of the world." Now, there is no danger in giving the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> such an occasion of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>; since the help of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, who is the Author of the perfect <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, is more powerful* than the assault of the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. [All the codices read 'majus.' One of the earliest printed editions has 'magis,' which has much to commend it, since <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> is commenting the text quoted from <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a>. The translation would run thus: 'since rather is it (the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>) a help from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, who,' etc.].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Some say that all the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> took place in the desert. Of these some say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was led into the Holy City, not really, but in an <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision; while others say that the Holy City itself, i.e. Jerusalem, is called "a desert," because it was deserted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But there is no need for this explanation. For Mark says that He was tempted in the desert by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, but not that He was tempted in the desert only.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether Christ's temptation should have taken place after His fast?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> should not have taken place after His fast. For it has been said above (Question 40, Article 2) that an austere mode of life was not becoming to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But it savors of extreme austerity that He should have eaten nothing for forty days and forty nights, for <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Hom. xvi inn Evang.) explains the fact that "He fasted forty days and forty nights," saying that "during that time He partook of no food whatever." It seems, therefore, that He should not thus have fasted before His <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/mar001.htm#verse13">Mark 1:13</a>) that "He was in the desert forty days and forty nights; and was tempted by Satan." Now, He fasted forty days and forty nights. Therefore it seems that He was tempted by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, not after, but during, His fast.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, we read that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> fasted but once. But He was tempted by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, not only once, for it is written (<a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse13">Luke 4:13</a>) "that all the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> being ended, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> departed from Him for a time." As, therefore, He did not fast before the second <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, so neither should He have fasted before the first.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse2">Matthew 4:2-3</a>): "When He had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterwards He was hungry": and then "the tempter came to Him."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It was becoming that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should wish to fast before His temptation. First, in order to give us an example. For since we are all in urgent need of strengthening ourselves against <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), by <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> before being tempted, He teaches us the need of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> in order to equip ourselves against <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse5">2 Corinthians 6:5-7</a>) reckons "fastings" together with the "armor of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>."

<p>Secondly, in order to show that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> assails with <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> even those who fast, as likewise those who are given to other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works. And so Christ's <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> took place after His fast, as also after His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Hence since rather <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. xiii super Matth.): "To instruct thee how great a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, and how it is a most powerful shield against the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; and that after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> thou shouldst give thyself up, not to luxury, but to <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>; for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> Christ fasted, not as needing it Himself, but as teaching us."

<p>Thirdly, because after the fast, hunger followed, which made the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> dare to approach Him, as already stated (1, ad 1). Now, when "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> was hungry," says <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> (Super Matth. iii), "it was not because He was overcome by want of food, but because He abandoned His manhood to its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> was to be conquered, not by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but by the flesh." Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> too says: "He proceeded no farther than <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elias, lest His assumption of our flesh might seem incredible."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It was becoming for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> not to adopt an extreme form of austere life in order to show Himself outwardly in conformity with those to whom He preached. Now, no one should take up the office of preacher unless he be already cleansed and perfect in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, according to what is said of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> began to do and to teach" (<a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse1">Acts 1:1</a>). Consequently, immediately after His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> Christ adopted an austere form of life, in order to teach us the need of taming the flesh before passing on to the office of preaching, according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse27">1 Corinthians 9:27</a>): "I chastise my body, and bring it into subjection, lest perhaps when I have preached to others, I myself should become a castaway."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> These words of Mark may be understood as meaning that "He was in the desert forty days and forty nights," and that He fasted during that time: and the words, "and He was tempted by Satan," may be taken as referring, not to the time during which He fasted, but to the time that followed: since Matthew says that "after He had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterwards He was hungry," thus affording the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> a pretext for approaching Him. And so the words that follow, and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> ministered to Him, are to be taken in sequence, which is clear from the words of Matthew (<a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse11">4:11</a>): "Then the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> left Him," i.e. after the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, "and behold <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> came and ministered to Him." And as to the words inserted by Mark, "and He was with the beasts," according to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> (Hom. xiii in Matth.), they are set down in order to describe the desert as being impassable to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and full of beasts.

<p>On the other hand, according to <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede's</a> exposition of <a href="../bible/mar001.htm#verse12">Mark 1:12-13</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> was tempted forty days and forty nights. But this is not to be understood of the visible <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> which are related by Matthew and Luke, and occurred after the fast, but of certain other assaults which perhaps <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> suffered from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> during that time of His fast.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says on <a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse13">Luke 4:13</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> departed from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> "for a time, because, later on, he returned, not to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> Him, but to assail Him openly"--namely, at the time of His Passion. Nevertheless, He seemed in this later assault to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to dejection and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of His neighbor; just as in the desert he had tempted Him to gluttonous pleasure and idolatrous contempt of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the mode and order of the temptation were becoming?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the mode and order of the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> were unbecoming. For the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> tempts in order to induce us to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had assuaged His bodily hunger by changing the stones into bread, He would not have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>; just as neither did He <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> when He multiplied the loaves, which was no less a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, in order to succor the hungry crowd. Therefore it seems that this was nowise a <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a counselor is inconsistent if he persuades the contrary to what he intends. But when the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> set <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> on a pinnacle of the Temple, he purposed to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> Him to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> or vainglory. Therefore it was inconsistent to urge Him to cast Himself thence: for this would be contrary to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> or vainglory, which always seeks to rise.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, one <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> should lead to one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But in the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> on the mountain he counseled two <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>--namely, <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> and <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. Therefore the mode of the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> was unfitting.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> are ordained to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But there are seven deadly <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as we have stated in I-II, 84, 4. But the tempter only deals with three, viz. <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, vainglory, and <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> seems to have been incomplete.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, after overcoming all the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is still tempted to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> or vainglory: since <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> "worms itself in stealthily, and destroys even <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. ccxi). Therefore Matthew unfittingly gives the last place to the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> on the mountain, and the second place to the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> to vainglory in the Temple, especially since Luke puts them in the reverse order.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on <a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse4">Matthew 4:4</a> that "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> purposed to overcome the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> by <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, not by might." Therefore He should not have repulsed him with a haughty rebuke, saying: "Begone, Satan."

<p><strong>Objection 7.</strong> Further, the gospel narrative seems to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. For it seems impossible that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> could have been set on a pinnacle of the Temple without being seen by others. Nor is there to be found a mountain so high that all the world can be seen from it, so that all the kingdoms of the earth could be shown to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> from its summit. It seems, therefore, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> is unfittingly described.

<p><strong>On the contrary</strong> is the authority of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> which comes from the enemy takes the form of a suggestion, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xvi in Evang.). Now a suggestion cannot be made to everybody in the same way; it must arise from those things towards which each one has an inclination. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> does not straight away <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to grave <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but he begins with lighter <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, so as gradually to lead him to those of greater magnitude. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi), expounding <a href="../bible/job039.htm#verse25">Job 39:25</a>, "He smelleth the battle afar off, the encouraging of the captains and the shouting of the army," says: "The captains are fittingly described as encouraging, and the army as shouting. Because <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> begin by insinuating themselves into the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> under some specious pretext: then they come on the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> in such numbers as to drag it into all sorts of folly, deafening it with their bestial clamor."

<p>Thus, too, did the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> set about the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> of the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For at first he enticed his mind to consent to the eating of the forbidden fruit, saying (<a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse1">Genesis 3:1</a>): "Why hath <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> commanded you that you should not eat of every tree of paradise?" Secondly [he tempted him] to vainglory by saying: "Your eyes shall be opened." Thirdly, he led the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> to the extreme height of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, saying: "You shall be as gods, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." This same order did he observe in <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempting</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For at first he tempted Him to that which men desire, however <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> they may be--namely, the support of the corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> by food. Secondly, he advanced to that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in which <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> men are sometimes found wanting, inasmuch as they do certain things for show, which pertains to vainglory. Thirdly, he led the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> on to that in which no <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> men, but only carnal men, have a part--namely, to desire worldly <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> and fame, to the extent of holding <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in contempt. And so in the first two <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> he said: "If Thou be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>"; but not in the third, which is inapplicable to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> men, who are sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by adoption, whereas it does apply to the two preceding <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>.

<p>And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> resisted these <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> by quoting the authority of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, not by enforcing His power, "so as to give more <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and a greater punishment to His adversary, since the foe of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> was vanquished, not as by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but as by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>"; as Pope Leo says (Serm. 1, De Quadrag. 3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> To make use of what is needful for self-support is not the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>; but if a man do anything inordinate out of the desire for such support, it can pertain to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>. Now it is inordinate for a man who has <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> assistance at his command to seek to obtain food <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> for mere bodily support. Hence the Lord <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> provided the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> with manna in the desert, where there was no means of obtaining food otherwise. And in like fashion Christ <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> provided the crowds with food in the desert, when there was no other means of getting food. But in order to assuage His hunger, He could have done otherwise than work a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, as did <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a>, according to Matthew (<a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse4">3:4</a>); or He could have hastened to the neighboring country. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> esteemed that if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was a mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, He would fall into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by attempting to assuage His hunger by a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It often happens that a man seeks to derive <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> from external humiliation, whereby he is exalted by reason of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 12): "It must be noted that it is possible to boast not only of the beauty and splendor of material things, but even of filthy squalor." And this is signified by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> urging <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to seek <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> by casting His body down.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to desire worldly <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> and honors in an inordinate fashion. And the principal sign of this is when a man does something wrong in order to acquire such things. And so the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> was not satisfied with instigating to a desire for <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> and honors, but he went so far as to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, for the sake of gaining possession of these things, to fall down and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> him, which is a very great crime, and against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Nor does he say merely, "if Thou wilt <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> me," but he adds, "if, falling down"; because, as <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says on <a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse5">Luke 4:5</a>: "Ambition harbors yet another danger within itself: for, while seeking to rule, it will serve; it will bow in submission that it may be crowned with <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>; and the higher it aims, the lower it abases itself."

<p>In like manner [the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>] in the preceding <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> tried to lead [Christ] from the desire of one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to the commission of another; thus from the desire of food he tried to lead Him to the vanity of the needless working of a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>; and from the desire of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by casting Himself headlong.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says on <a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse13">Luke 4:13</a>, <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> would not have said that "'all the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> being ended, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> departed from Him,' unless the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> were included in the three <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> already related. For the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of desires"--namely, "<a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh, hope of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, eagerness for power."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Consensu Evang. ii): "It is not certain which happened first; whether the kingdoms of the earth were first shown to Him, and afterwards He was set on the pinnacle of the Temple; or the latter first, and the former afterwards. However, it matters not, provided it be made clear that all these things did take place." It may be that the Evangelists set these things in different orders, because sometimes cupidity arises from vainglory, sometimes the reverse happens.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> When <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had suffered the wrong of being tempted by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> saying, "If Thou be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> cast Thyself down," He was not troubled, nor did He upbraid the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. But when the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> usurped to himself the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying, "All these things will I give Thee, if, falling down, Thou wilt <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> me," He was exasperated, and repulsed him, saying, "Begone, Satan": that we might learn from His example to bear bravely insults leveled at ourselves, but not to allow ourselves so much as to listen to those which are aimed at <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 7.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. v in Matth.): "The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> set Him" (on a pinnacle of the Temple) "that He might be seen by all, whereas, unawares to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, He acted in such sort that He was seen by none."

<p>In regard to the words, "'He showed Him all the kingdoms of the world, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of them,' we are not to understand that He saw the very kingdoms, with the cities and inhabitants, their gold and silver: but that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> pointed out the quarters in which each kingdom or city lay, and set forth to Him in words their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and estate." Or, again, as <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> says (Hom. xxx in Luc.), "he showed Him how, by means of the various <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, he was the lord of the world."
