<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether fear is a passion of the soul?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that fear is not a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 23) that "fear is a power, by way of <em>systole</em>"--i.e. of contraction--"desirous of vindicating <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." But no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in Ethic. ii, 5. Therefore fear is not a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> is an effect due to the presence of an agent. But fear is not of something present, but of something future, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> declares (De Fide Orth. ii, 12). Therefore fear is not a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a movement of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, in consequence of an apprehension of the senses. But sense apprehends, not the future but the present. Since, then, fear is of future <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, it seems that it is not a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei xiv, 5, seqq.) reckons fear among the other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Among the other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, after sorrow, fear chiefly has the character of passion. For as we have stated above (<a href="#22">Article 22</a>), the notion of passion implies first of all a movement of a passive power--i.e. of a power whose object is compared to it as its active principle: since passion is the effect of an agent. In this way, both "to feel" and "to understand" are <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Secondly, more properly speaking, passion is a movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power; and more properly still, it is a movement of an <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power that has a bodily organ, such movement being accompanied by a bodily transmutation. And, again, most properly those movements are called <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, which imply some deterioration. Now it is evident that fear, since it regards <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, belongs to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, which of itself regards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Moreover, it belongs to the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>: for it is accompanied by a certain transmutation--i.e. contraction--as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (Cf. Objection 1). Again, it implies relation to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as overcoming, so to speak, some particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Wherefore it has most properly the character of passion; less, however, than sorrow, which regards the present <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: because fear regards future <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, which is not so strong a motive as present <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Virtue denotes a principle of action: wherefore, in so far as the interior movements of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> faculty are principles of external action, they are called <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> denies that passion is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> by way of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as the passion of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> body is due to the bodily presence of an agent, so is the passion of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> due to the agent being present to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, although neither corporally nor really present: that is to say, in so far as the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which is really future, is present in the apprehension of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The senses do not apprehend the future: but from apprehending the present, an animal is moved by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> instinct to hope for a future <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, or to fear a future <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether fear is a special passion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that fear is not a special passion. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. 83, qu. 33) that "the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who is not distraught by fear, is neither harassed by desire, nor wounded by sickness"--i.e. sorrow--"nor tossed about in transports of empty <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joys</a>." Wherefore it seems that, if fear be set aside, all the other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are removed. Therefore fear is not a special but a general passion.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vi, 2) that "pursuit and avoidance in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> are what affirmation and denial are in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>." But denial is nothing special in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as neither is affirmation, but something common to many. Therefore neither is avoidance anything special in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. But fear is nothing but a kind of avoidance of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore it is not a special passion.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if fear were a special passion, it would be chiefly in the irascible part. But fear is also in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>: since the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 5) that "fear is a kind of sorrow"; and <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 23) that fear is "a power of desire": and both sorrow and desire are in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty, as stated above (Question 23, Article 4). Therefore fear is not a special passion, since it belongs to different powers.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Fear is condivided with the other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as is clear from <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. ii, 12,15).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> derive their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from their objects: hence that is a special passion, which has a special object. Now fear has a special object, as hope has. For just as the object of hope is a future <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, difficult but possible to obtain; so the object of fear is a future <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, difficult and irresistible. Consequently fear is a special passion of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> All the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> arise from one source, viz. love, wherein they are connected with one another. By reason of this connection, when fear is put aside, the other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are dispersed; not, however, as though it were a general passion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Not every avoidance in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is fear, but avoidance of a special object, as stated. Wherefore, though avoidance be something common, yet fear is a special passion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Fear is nowise in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>: for it regards <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, not absolutely, but as difficult or arduous, so as to be almost unavoidable. But since the irascible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> arise from the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty, and terminate therein, as stated above (Question 25, Article 01); hence it is that what belongs to the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> is ascribed to fear. For fear is called sorrow, in so far as the object of fear <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> sorrow when present: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 5) that fear arises "from the representation of a future <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which is either corruptive or painful." In like manner desire is ascribed by <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> to fear, because just as hope arises from the desire of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, so fear arises from avoidance of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; while avoidance of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> arises from the desire of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as is evident from what has been said above (25, 2; 29, 02; 36, 2).

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether there is a natural fear?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> fear. For <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 23) that "there is a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> fear, through the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> refusing to be severed from the body."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, fear arises from love, as stated above (02, ad 1). But there is a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv). Therefore there is also a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> fear.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, fear is opposed to <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, as stated above (40, 4, ad 1). But there is a hope of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as is evident from <a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse18">Romans 4:18</a>, where it is said of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> that "against hope" of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, "he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in hope" of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore there is also a fear of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> That which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> is common to things animate and inanimate. But fear is not in things inanimate. Therefore there is no <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> fear.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A movement is said to be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, because <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> inclines thereto. Now this happens in two ways. First, so that it is entirely accomplished by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, without any operation of the apprehensive faculty: thus to have an upward movement is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to fire, and to grow is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> movement of animals and plants. Secondly, a movement is said to be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, if <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> inclines thereto, though it be accomplished by the apprehensive faculty alone: since, as stated above (Question 10, Article 1), the movements of the cognitive and <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> faculties are reducible to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as to their first principle. In this way, even the acts of the apprehensive power, such as understanding, feeling, and remembering, as well as the movements of the animal <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, are sometimes said to be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>.

<p>And in this sense we may say that there is a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> fear; and it is distinguished from non-<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> fear, by reason of the diversity of its object. For, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 5), there is a fear of "corruptive <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>," which <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> shrinks from on account of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> desire to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>; and such fear is said to be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>. Again, there is a fear of "painful <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>," which is repugnant not to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but to the desire of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; and such fear is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>. In this sense we have stated above (26, 1; 30, 3; 31, 7) that love, desire, and pleasure are divisible into <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and non-<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>.

<p>But in the first sense of the word "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>," we must observe that certain <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are sometimes said to be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, as love, desire, and hope; whereas the others cannot be called <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>. The reason of this is because love and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, desire and avoidance, imply a certain inclination to pursue what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or to avoid what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; which inclination is to be found in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> also. Consequently there is a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love; while we may also speak of desire and hope as being even in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things devoid of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. On the other hand the other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> denote certain movements, whereto the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination is nowise sufficient. This is due either to the fact that perception or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to these <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> (thus we have said, 31, 1,3; 35, 1, that apprehension is a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of pleasure and sorrow), wherefore things devoid of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> cannot be said to take pleasure or to be sorrowful: or else it is because such like movements are contrary to the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination: for instance, <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> flies from <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> on account of some difficulty; and fear shrinks from repelling a contrary <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; both of which are contrary to the inclination of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Wherefore such like <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are in no way ascribed to inanimate beings.

<p>Thus the Replies to the Objections are evident.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the species of fear is suitably assigned?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that six <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of fear are unsuitably assigned by <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. ii, 15); namely, "laziness, shamefacedness, shame, amazement, stupor, and anxiety." Because, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 5), "fear regards a saddening <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of fear should correspond to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of sorrow. Now there are four <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of sorrow, as stated above (Question 35, Article 8). Therefore there should only be four <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of fear corresponding to them.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which consists in an action of our own is in our power. But fear regards an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that surpasses our power, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Therefore laziness, shamefacedness, and shame, which regard our own actions, should not be reckoned as <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of fear.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, fear is of the future, as stated above (Question 1, Article 2). But "shame regards a disgraceful <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> already done," as <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> [Nemesius, De Nat. Hom. xx.] says. Therefore shame is not a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of fear.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, fear is only of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But amazement and stupor regard great and unwonted things, whether <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore amazement and stupor are not <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of fear.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, Philosophers have been led by amazement to seek the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as stated in the beginning of Metaphysics. But fear leads to flight rather than to search. Therefore amazement is not a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of fear.

<p><strong>On the contrary</strong> suffices the authority of <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> and <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> [Nemesius] (Cf. Objection 1,3).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), fear regards a future <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which surpasses the power of him that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a>, so that it is irresistible. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, like his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, may be considered either in his action or in external things. In his action he has a twofold <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to fear. First, there is the toil that burdens his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: and hence arises "laziness," as when a man shrinks from work for fear of too much toil. Secondly, there is the disgrace which damages him in the opinion of others. And thus, if disgrace is feared in a <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> that is yet to be done, there is "shamefacedness"; if, however, it be a <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> already done, there is "shame."

<p>On the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that consists in external things may surpass <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> faculty of resistance in three ways. First by reason of its magnitude; when, that is to say, a man considers some great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> the outcome of which he is unable to gauge: and then there is "amazement." Secondly, by reason of its being unwonted; because, to wit, some unwonted <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> arises before us, and on that account is great in our estimation: and then there is "stupor," which is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the representation of something unwonted. Thirdly, by reason of its being unforeseen: thus future misfortunes are feared, and fear of this kind is called "anxiety."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Those <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of sorrow given above are not derived from the diversity of objects, but from the diversity of effects, and for certain special reasons. Consequently there is no need for those <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of sorrow to correspond with these <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of fear, which are derived from the proper division of the object of fear itself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> considered as being actually done, is in the power of the doer. But it is possible to take into consideration something connected with the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, and surpassing the faculty of the doer, for which reason he shrinks from the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>. It is in this sense that laziness, shamefacedness, and shame are reckoned as <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of fear.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The past <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> may be the occasion of fear of future reproach or disgrace: and in this sense shame is a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of fear.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Not every amazement and stupor are <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of fear, but that amazement which is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by a great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and that stupor which arises from an unwonted <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Or else we may say that, just as laziness shrinks from the toil of external work, so amazement and stupor shrink from the difficulty of considering a great and unwonted thing, whether <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: so that amazement and stupor stand in relation to the act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as laziness does to external work.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> He who is amazed shrinks at present from forming a judgment of that which amazes him, fearing to fall short of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but inquires afterwards: whereas he who is overcome by stupor <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> both to judge at present, and to inquire afterwards. Wherefore amazement is a beginning of philosophical research: whereas stupor is a hindrance thereto.
