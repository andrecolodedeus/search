<h1>Question 41. Strife</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3041.htm#article1"> Is strife a sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3041.htm#article2"> Is it a daughter of anger?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether strife is always a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that strife is not always a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For strife seems a kind of contention: hence <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. x) that the word "rixosus [quarrelsome] is derived from the snarling [rictu] of a dog, because the quarrelsome <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is ever ready to contradict; he delights in brawling, and provokes contention." Now contention is not always a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Neither, therefore, is strife.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is related (<a href="../bible/gen026.htm#verse21">Genesis 26:21</a>) that the servants of <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> "digged" another well, "and for that they quarrelled likewise." Now it is not credible that the household of <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> quarrelled publicly, without being reproved by him, supposing it were a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore strife is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, strife seems to be a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>. But <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> is not always <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. Therefore strife is not always a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Strifes [The <a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay version</a> has 'quarrels'] are reckoned among the works of the flesh (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse20">Galatians 5:20</a>), and "they who do such things shall not obtain the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>." Therefore strifes are not only <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, but they are even mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> While contention implies a contradiction of words, strife denotes a certain contradiction of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. Wherefore a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse20">Galatians 5:20</a> says that "strifes are when <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> strike one another through <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>." Hence strife is a kind of private <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, because it takes place between private <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, being declared not by public authority, but rather by an inordinate will. Therefore strife is always <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. On fact it is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who attacks another <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>, for it is not without mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that one inflicts harm on another even if the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> be done by the hands. But in him who defends himself, it may be without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or it may sometimes involve a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or sometimes a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and this depends on his <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> and on his manner of defending himself. For if his sole <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> be to withstand the injury done to him, and he defend himself with due moderation, it is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and one cannot say properly that there is strife on his part. But if, on the other hand, his self-defense be inspired by vengeance and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, it is always a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. It is a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, if a slight movement of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> or vengeance obtrude itself, or if he does not much exceed moderation in defending himself: but it is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> if he makes for his assailant with the fixed <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of killing him, or inflicting grievous harm on him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Strife is not just the same as contention: and there are three things in the passage quoted from <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a>, which express the inordinate <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of strife. First, the quarrelsome <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is always ready to fight, and this is conveyed by the words, "ever ready to contradict," that is to say, whether the other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> says or does well or ill. Secondly, he delights in quarrelling itself, and so the passage proceeds, "and delights in brawling." Thirdly, "he" provokes others to quarrel, wherefore it goes on, "and provokes contention."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The sense of the text is not that the servants of <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> quarrelled, but that the inhabitants of that country quarrelled with them: wherefore these <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and not the servants of <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, who bore the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> [Cf. <a href="../bible/gen026.htm#verse20">Genesis 26:20</a>.]

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In order for a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> to be just it must be declared by authority of the governing power, as stated above (Question 40, Article 1); whereas strife proceeds from a private feeling of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. For if the servants of a sovereign or judge, in virtue of their public authority, attack certain men and these defend themselves, it is not the former who are said to be guilty of strife, but those who resist the public authority. Hence it is not the assailants in this case who are guilty of strife and commit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but those who defend themselves inordinately.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether strife is a daughter of anger?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that strife is not a daughter of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/jam004.htm#verse1">James 4:1</a>): "Whence are <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> and contentions? Are they not . . . from your <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a>, which <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> in your members?" But <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is not in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty. Therefore strife is a daughter, not of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, but of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/pro028.htm#verse25">Proverbs 28:25</a>): "He that boasteth and puffeth up himself, stirreth up quarrels." Now strife is apparently the same as quarrel. Therefore it seems that strife is a daughter of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> or vainglory which makes a man boast and puff himself up.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/pro018.htm#verse6">Proverbs 18:6</a>): "The lips of a fool intermeddle with strife." Now folly differs from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, for it is opposed, not to meekness, but to wisdom or <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Therefore strife is not a daughter of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/pro010.htm#verse12">Proverbs 10:12</a>): "Hatred stirreth up strifes." But <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> arises from <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi, 17). Therefore strife is not a daughter of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, but of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/pro017.htm#verse19">Proverbs 17:19</a>): "He that studieth discords, soweth [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'loveth'] quarrels." But discord is a daughter of vainglory, as stated above (Question 37, Article 2). Therefore strife is also.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxi, 17) that "<a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> gives rise to strife"; and it is written (<a href="../bible/pro015.htm#verse18">Proverbs 15:18</a>; <a href="../bible/pro015.htm#verse22">29:22</a>): "A passionate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> stirreth up strifes."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), strife denotes an antagonism extending to <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, when one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> designs to harm another. Now there are two ways in which one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may intend to harm another. On one way it is as though he intended absolutely the other's hurt, which in this case is the outcome of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is directed to the hurt of one's enemy either openly or secretly. On another way a man intends to hurt another who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> and withstands his <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>. This is what we mean by strife, and belongs properly to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> which is the desire of vengeance: for the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not content to hurt secretly the object of his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, he even wishes him to feel the hurt and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that what he suffers is in revenge for what he has done, as may be seen from what has been said above about the passion of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> (I-II, 46, 6, ad 2). Therefore, properly speaking, strife arises from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (I-II, 25, 1,2), all the irascible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> arise from those of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty, so that whatever is the immediate outcome of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, arises also from <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> as from its first root.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Boasting and puffing up of self which are the result of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> or vainglory, are not the direct but the occasional <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of quarrels or strife, because, when a man resents another being preferred to him, his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is aroused, and then his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> results in quarrel and strife.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Anger, as stated above (I-II, 48, 3) hinders the judgment of the reason, so that it bears a likeness to folly. Hence they have a common effect, since it is due to a defect in the reason that a man designs to hurt another inordinately.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Although strife sometimes arises from <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, it is not the proper effect thereof, because when one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> another it is beside his <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> to hurt him in a quarrelsome and open manner, since sometimes he seeks to hurt him secretly. When, however, he sees himself prevailing, he endeavors to harm him with strife and quarrel. But to hurt a man in a quarrel is the proper effect of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, for the reason given above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Strifes give rise to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> and discord in the hearts of those who are guilty of strife, and so he that "studies," i.e., intends to sow discord among others, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> them to quarrel among themselves. Even so any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may command the act of another <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, by directing it to its own end. This does not, however, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that strife is the daughter of vainglory properly and directly.
