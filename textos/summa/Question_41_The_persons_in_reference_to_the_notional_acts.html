<h1>Question 41. The persons in reference to the notional acts</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1041.htm#article1"> Are the notional acts to be attributed to the persons?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1041.htm#article2"> Are these acts necessary, or voluntary?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1041.htm#article3"> As regards these acts, does a person proceed from nothing or from something?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1041.htm#article4"> Does there exist in God a power as regards the notional acts?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1041.htm#article5"> What does this power mean?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1041.htm#article6"> Can several persons be the term of one notional act?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the notional acts are to be attributed to the persons?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the notional acts are not to be attributed to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Trin.): "Whatever is predicated of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of whatever genus it be, becomes the divine <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, except what pertains to the relation." But action is one of the ten "genera." Therefore any action attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> belongs to His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, and not to a notion.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. v, 4,5) that, "everything which is said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is said of Him as regards either His <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, or relation." But whatever belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is signified by the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> attributes; and whatever belongs to the relations, by the names of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, or by the names of the properties. Therefore, in addition to these, notional acts are not to be attributed to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of action is of itself to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> passion. But we do not place <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore neither are notional acts to be placed in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Fulgentius, De Fide ad Petrum ii) says: "It is a property of the Father to beget the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>." Therefore notional acts are to be placed in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> distinction is founded on origin. But origin can be properly designated only by certain acts. Wherefore, to signify the order of origin in the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, we must attribute notional acts to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Every origin is designated by an act. In <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is a twofold order of origin: one, inasmuch as the creature proceeds from Him, and this is common to the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; and so those actions which are attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to designate the proceeding of creatures from Him, belong to His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Another order of origin in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> regards the procession of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> from <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; wherefore the acts which designate the order of this origin are called notional; because the notions of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are the mutual relations of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, as is clear from what was above explained (32, 2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The notional acts differ from the relations of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> only in their mode of signification; and in reality are altogether the same. Whence the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> says that "generation and nativity in other words are paternity and filiation" (Sent. i, D, xxvi). To see this, we must consider that the origin of one thing from another is firstly inferred from movement: for that anything be changed from its disposition by movement evidently arises from some <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Hence action, in its primary sense, means origin of movement; for, as movement derived from another into a mobile object, is called "passion," so the origin of movement itself as beginning from another and terminating in what is moved, is called "action." Hence, if we take away movement, action implies nothing more than order of origin, in so far as action proceeds from some <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> or principle to what is from that principle. Consequently, since in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> no movement <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>, the personal action of the one producing a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is only the habitude of the principle to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who is from the principle; which habitudes are the relations, or the notions. Nevertheless we cannot speak of divine and intelligible things except after the manner of sensible things, whence we derive our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and wherein actions and <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, so far as these imply movement, differ from the relations which result from action and passion, and therefore it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to signify the habitudes of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> separately after the manner of act, and separately after the manner of relations. Thus it is evident that they are really the same, differing only in their mode of signification.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Action, so far as it means origin of movement, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> involves passion; but action in that sense is not attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Whence, <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are attributed to Him only from a grammatical standpoint, and in accordance with our manner of speaking, as we attribute "to beget" with the Father, and to the Son "to be begotten."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the notional acts are voluntary?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the notional acts are <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. For <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (De Synod.): "Not by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> was the Father led to beget the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says, "He transferred us to the kingdom of the Son of His love" (<a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse13">Colossians 1:13</a>). But love belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore the Son was begotten of the Father by will.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, nothing is more <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> than love. But the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> proceeds as Love from the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. Therefore He proceeds <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the Son proceeds by mode of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as the Word. But every word proceeds by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> from a speaker. Therefore the Son proceeds from the Father by will, and not by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, what is not <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Therefore if the Father begot the Son, not by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, it seems to follow that He begot Him by <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>; and this is against what <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ad Orosium qu. vii).

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says, in the same book, that, "the Father begot the Son neither by will, nor by <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> When anything is said to be, or to be made by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, this can be understood in two senses. In one sense, the ablative designates only concomitance, as I can say that I am a man by my will--that is, I will to be a man; and in this way it can be said that the Father begot the Son by will; as also He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by will, because He wills to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and wills to beget the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. In the other sense, the ablative imports the habitude of a principle as it is said that the workman works by his will, as the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the principle of his work; and thus in that sense it must be said the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father begot the Son, not by His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; but that He produced the creature by His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Whence in the book De Synod, it is said: "If anyone say that the Son was made by the Will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as a creature is said to be made, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>." The reason of this is that will and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> differ in their manner of causation, in such a way that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is determined to one, while the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not determined to one; and this because the effect is assimilated to the form of the agent, whereby the latter acts. Now it is manifest that of one thing there is only one <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> form whereby it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>; and hence such as it is itself, such also is its work. But the form whereby the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> acts is not only one, but many, according to the number of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> understood. Hence the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will's</a> action does not depend on the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of the agent, but on the agent's will and understanding. So the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the principle of those things which may be this way or that way; whereas of those things which can be only in one way, the principle is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. What, however, can <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in different ways is far from the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, whereas it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> being; because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is of Himself <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> being, whereas a creature is made from nothing. Thus, the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, wishing to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the Son to be a creature, said that the Father begot the Son by will, taking will in the sense of principle. But we, on the contrary, must assert that the Father begot the Son, not by will, but by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (De Synod.): "The will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave to all creatures their <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>: but perfect birth gave the Son a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> derived from a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> impassible and unborn. All things <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> are such as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> willed them to be; but the Son, born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, subsists in the perfect likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This saying is directed against those who did not admit even the concomitance of the Father's will in the generation of the Son, for they said that the Father begot the Son in such a manner by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to beget was wanting; just as we ourselves suffer many things against our will from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>--as, for instance, death, old age, and like ills. This appears from what precedes and from what follows as regards the words quoted, for thus we read: "Not against His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, nor as it were, forced, nor as if He were led by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> did the Father beget the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> calls <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the Son of the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, inasmuch as He is superabundantly loved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; not, however, as if love were the principle of the Son's generation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The will, as a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> faculty, wills something <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> tends to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>; and likewise <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> wills and loves Himself; whereas in regard to things other than Himself, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in a way, undetermined in itself, as above explained (19, 3). Now, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> proceeds as Love, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> loves Himself, and hence He proceeds <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, although He proceeds by mode of will.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Even as regards the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> conceptions of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, a return is made to those first principles which are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> understood. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> understands Himself, and thus the conception of the divine Word is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> A thing is said to be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> "of itself," and "by reason of another." Taken in the latter sense, it has a twofold meaning: firstly, as an efficient and compelling <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and thus <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> means what is <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a>; secondly, it means a final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, when a thing is said to be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> as the means to an end, so far as without it the end could not be attained, or, at least, so well attained. In neither of these ways is the divine generation <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>; because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the means to an end, nor is He subject to compulsion. But a thing is said to be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> "of itself" which cannot but be: in this sense it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be; and in the same sense it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the Father beget the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the notional acts proceed from something?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the notional acts do not proceed from anything. For if the Father begets the Son from something, this will be either from Himself or from something else. If from something else, since that whence a thing is generated <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in what is generated, it follows that something different from the Father <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in the Son, and this contradicts what is laid down by <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> (De Trin. vii) that, "In them nothing diverse or different <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>." If the Father begets the Son from Himself, since again that whence a thing is generated, if it be something permanent, receives as predicate the thing generated therefrom just as we say, "The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is white," since the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> remains, when not from white he is made white--it follows that either the Father does not remain after the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is begotten, or that the Father is the Son, which is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Therefore the Father does not beget the Son from something, but from nothing.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that whence anything is generated is the principle regarding what is generated. So if the Father generate the Son from His own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> or <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it follows that the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> or <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Father is the principle of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. But it is not a material principle, because in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> nothing material <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>; and therefore it is, as it were, an active principle, as the begetter is the principle of the one begotten. Thus it follows that the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> generates, which was disproved above (Question 39, Article 5).

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. vii, 6) that the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are not from the same <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; because the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is not another thing from <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is not another thing from the Father's <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is not from the Father's <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, every creature is from nothing. But in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is called a creature; for it is said (<a href="../bible/sir024.htm#verse5">Sirach 24:5</a>), in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Wisdom begotten,"I came out of the mouth of the Most High, the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> before all creatures": and further on (<a href="../bible/sir024.htm#verse14">Sirach 24:14</a>) it is said as uttered by the same Wisdom, "From the beginning, and before the world was I <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>." Therefore the Son was not begotten from something, but from nothing. Likewise we can object concerning the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, by reason of what is said (<a href="../bible/zec012.htm#verse1">Zechariah 12:1</a>): "Thus saith the Lord Who stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundations of the earth, and formeth the spirit of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> within him"; and (<a href="../bible/amo004.htm#verse13">Amos 4:13</a>) according to another version [the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>]: "I Who form the earth, and create the spirit."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Fulgentius, De Fide ad Petrum i, 1) says: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father, of His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, without beginning, begot the Son equal to Himself."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The Son was not begotten from nothing, but from the Father's <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. For it was explained above (27, 2; 33, 2,3) that paternity, filiation and nativity really and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now, this is the difference between <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> "generation," whereby one proceeds from another as a son, and "making," that the maker makes something out of external <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as a carpenter makes a bench out of wood, whereas a man begets a son from himself. Now, as a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> workman makes a thing out of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, so <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> makes things out of nothing, as will be shown later on (45, 1), not as if this nothing were a part of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the thing made, but because the whole <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of a thing is produced by Him without anything else whatever presupposed. So, were the Son to proceed from the Father as out of nothing, then the Son would be to the Father what the thing made is to the maker, whereto, as is evident, the name of filiation would not apply except by a kind of similitude. Thus, if the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> proceeds from the Father out of nothing, He could not be properly and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> called the Son, whereas the contrary is stated (<a href="../bible/1jo005.htm#verse20">1 John 5:20</a>): "That we may be in His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Son <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is not from nothing; nor is He made, but begotten.

<p>That certain creatures made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> out of nothing are called sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is to be taken in a metaphorical sense, according to a certain likeness of assimilation to Him Who is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Son. Whence, as He is the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, He is called the "only begotten," according to <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse18">John 1:18</a>, "The only begotten Son, Who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared Him"; and so as others are entitled sons of adoption by their similitude to Him, He is called the "first begotten," according to <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse29">Romans 8:29</a>: "Whom He foreknew He also <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to be made conformable to the image of His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, that He might be the first born of many brethren." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is begotten of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the Father, but not in the same way as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is born of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; for a part of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> in generation passes into the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the one begotten, whereas the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> cannot be parted; whence it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> follows that the Father in begetting the Son does not transmit any part of His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but communicates His whole <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to Him, the distinction only of origin remaining as explained above (Question 40, Article 2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> When we say that the Son was born of the Father, the preposition "of" designates a consubstantial generating principle, but not a material principle. For that which is produced from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, is made by a change of form in that whence it is produced. But the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is unchangeable, and is not susceptive of another form.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When we say the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is begotten of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the Father, as the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master of the Sentences</a> explains (Sent. i, D, v), this denotes the habitude of a kind of active principle, and as he expounds, "the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is begotten of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the Father"--that is, of the Father Who is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; and so <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xv, 13): "When I say of the Father Who is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, it is the same as if I said more explicitly, of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the Father."

<p>This, however, is not enough to explain the real meaning of the words. For we can say that the creature is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; but not that it is from the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. So we may explain them otherwise, by observing that the preposition "of" [de] always denotes consubstantiality. We do not say that a house is "of" [de] the builder, since he is not the consubstantial <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. We can say, however, that something is "of" another, if this is its consubstantial principle, no <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in what way it is so, whether it be an active principle, as the son is said to be "of" the father, or a material principle, as a knife is "of" iron; or a formal principle, but in those things only in which the forms are subsisting, and not <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to another, for we can say that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is "of" an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. In this way, then, we say that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is begotten 'of' the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the Father, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the Father, communicated by generation, subsists in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> When we say that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is begotten of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the Father, a term is added which saves the distinction. But when we say that the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are 'of' the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, there is nothing expressed to warrant the distinction signified by the preposition, so there is no parity of argument.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> When we say "Wisdom was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>," this may be understood not of Wisdom which is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, but of <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> wisdom given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to creatures: for it is said, "He <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> her [namely, Wisdom] in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and He poured her out over all His works" (<a href="../bible/sir001.htm#verse9">Sirach 1:9-10</a>). Nor is it inconsistent for <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> in one text to speak of the Wisdom begotten and wisdom <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>, for wisdom <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> is a kind of participation of the uncreated Wisdom. The saying may also be referred to the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> assumed by the Son, so that the sense be, "From the beginning and before the world was I made"--that is, I was foreseen as united to the creature. Or the mention of wisdom as both <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> and begotten insinuates into our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> the mode of the divine generation; for in generation what is generated receives the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the generator and this pertains to perfection; whereas in creation the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a> is not changed, but the creature does not receive the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Thus the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is called both <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> and begotten, in order that from the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of creation the immutability of the Father may be understood, and from generation the unity of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. In this way <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> expounds the sense of this text of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> (De Synod.). The other passages quoted do not refer to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, but to the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> spirit, sometimes called wind, sometimes air, sometimes the breath of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, sometimes also the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, or any other invisible <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether in God there is a power in respect of the notional acts?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is no power in respect of the notional acts. For every kind of power is either active or passive; neither of which can be here applied, there being in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> nothing which we call passive power, as above explained (25, 1); nor can active power belong to one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> as regards another, since the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> were not made, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). Therefore in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is no power in respect of the notional acts.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the object of power is what is possible. But the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are not regarded as possible, but <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Therefore, as regards the notional acts, whereby the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> proceed, there cannot be power in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the Son proceeds as the word, which is the concept of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> proceeds as love, which belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. But in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> power <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> as regards effects, and not as regards <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will, as stated above (Question 25, Article 1). Therefore, in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> power does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in reference to the notional acts.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Maxim. iii, 1): "If <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father could not beget a co-equal Son, where is the omnipotence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father?" Power therefore <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> regarding the notional acts.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As the notional acts <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so must there be also a power in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> regarding these acts; since power only means the principle of act. So, as we understand the Father to be principle of generation; and the Father and the Son to be the principle of spiration, we must attribute the power of generating to the Father, and the power of spiration to the Father and the Son; for the power of generation means that whereby the generator generates. Now every generator generates by something. Therefore in every generator we must suppose the power of generating, and in the spirator the power of spirating.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, according to notional acts, does not proceed as if made; so the power in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as regards the notional acts has no reference to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> as if made, but only as regards the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> as proceeding.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Possible, as opposed to what is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, is a consequence of a passive power, which does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence, in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is no such thing as possibility in this sense, but only in the sense of possible as contained in what is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>; and in this latter sense it can be said that as it is possible for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be, so also is it possible that the Son should be generated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Power signifies a principle: and a principle implies distinction from that of which it is the principle. Now we must observe a double distinction in things said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: one is a real distinction, the other is a distinction of reason only. By a real distinction, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is distinct from those things of which He is the principle by creation: just as one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is distinct from the other of which He is principle by a notional act. But in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the distinction of action and agent is one of reason only, otherwise action would be an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And therefore with regard to those actions in respect of which certain things proceed which are distinct from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, either personally or <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, we may ascribe power to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in its proper sense of principle. And as we ascribe to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the power of creating, so we may ascribe the power of begetting and of spirating. But "to understand" and "to will" are not such actions as to designate the procession of something distinct from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, either <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> or personally. Wherefore, with regard to these actions we cannot ascribe power to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in its proper sense, but only after our way of understanding and speaking: inasmuch as we designate by different terms the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and the act of understanding in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whereas in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the act of understanding is His very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> which has no principle.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the power of begetting signifies a relation, and not the essence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the power of begetting, or of spirating, signifies the relation and not the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. For power signifies a principle, as appears from its definition: for active power is the principle of action, as we find in Metaph. v, text 17. But in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> principle in regard to Person is said notionally. Therefore, in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, power does not signify <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> but relation.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the power to act [posse] and 'to act' are not distinct. But in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, begetting signifies relation. Therefore, the same applies to the power of begetting.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, terms signifying the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are common to the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. But the power of begetting is not common to the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, but proper to the Father. Therefore it does not signify the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has the power to beget the Son, so also He wills to beget Him. But the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to beget signifies the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Therefore, also, the power to beget.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some have said that the power to beget signifies relation in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But this is not possible. For in every agent, that is properly called power, by which the agent acts. Now, everything that produces something by its action, produces something like itself, as to the form by which it acts; just as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> begotten is like his begetter in his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, in virtue of which the father has the power to beget a man. In every begetter, therefore, that is the power of begetting in which the begotten is like the begetter.

<p>Now the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is like the Father, who begets Him, in the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Wherefore the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in the Father is in Him the power of begetting. And so <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (De Trin. v): "The birth of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot but contain that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> from which it proceeded; for He cannot subsist other than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who subsists from no other source than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p>We must therefore conclude that the power of begetting signifies principally the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> as the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> says (Sent. i, D, vii), and not the relation only. Nor does it signify the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> as identified with the relation, so as to signify both equally. For although paternity is signified as the form of the Father, nevertheless it is a personal property, being in respect to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Father, what the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> form is to the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> creature. Now the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> form in things <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> constitutes the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> begetting, but is not that by which the begetter begets, otherwise <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> would beget <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a>. So neither can paternity be understood as that by which the Father begets, but as constituting the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Father, otherwise the Father would beget the Father. But that by which the Father begets is the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, in which the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is like to Him. And in this sense <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. i, 18) that generation is the "work of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>," not of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> generating, but of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as being that by which the generator generates. And therefore the power of begetting signifies the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> directly, but the relation indirectly.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Power does not signify the relation itself of a principle, for thus it would be in the genus of relation; but it signifies that which is a principle; not, indeed, in the sense in which we call the agent a principle, but in the sense of being that by which the agent acts. Now the agent is distinct from that which it makes, and the generator from that which it generates: but that by which the generator generates is common to generated and generator, and so much more perfectly, as the generation is more perfect. Since, therefore, the divine generation is most perfect, that by which the Begetter begets, is common to Begotten and Begetter by a community of identity, and not only of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as in things <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>. Therefore, from the fact that we say that the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> "is the principle by which the Begetter begets," it does not follow that the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is distinct (from the Begotten): which would follow if we were to say that the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> begets.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the power of begetting is the same as the act of begetting, so the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is the same in reality as the act of begetting or paternity; although there is a distinction of reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> When I speak of the "power of begetting," power is signified directly, generation indirectly: just as if I were to say, the "<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the Father." Wherefore in respect of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, which is signified, the power of begetting is common to the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>: but in respect of the notion that is connoted, it is proper to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Father.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether several persons can be the term of one notional act?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a notional act can be directed to several Persons, so that there may be several Persons begotten or spirated in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For whoever has the power of begetting can beget. But the Son has the power of begetting. Therefore He can beget. But He cannot beget Himself: therefore He can beget another son. Therefore there can be several Sons in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Maxim. iii, 12): "The Son did not beget a Creator: not that He could not, but that it behoved Him not."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father has greater power to beget than has a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> father. But a man can beget several sons. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can also: the more so that the power of the Father is not diminished after begetting the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> In <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "that which is possible," and "that which is" do not differ. If, therefore, in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> it were possible for there to be several Sons, there would be several Sons. And thus there would be more than three Persons in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; which is <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> says, in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is only "one Father, one Son, one <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." For this four reasons may be given.

<p>The first reason is in regard to the relations by which alone are the Persons distinct. For since the divine Persons are the relations themselves as subsistent, there would not be several Fathers, or several Sons in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, unless there were more than one paternity, or more than one filiation. And this, indeed, would not be possible except owing to a material distinction: since forms of one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are not multiplied except in respect of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, which is not in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore there can be but one subsistent filiation in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: just as there could be but one subsistent whiteness.

<p>The second reason is taken from the manner of the processions. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> understands and wills all things by one simple act. Wherefore there can be but one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> proceeding after the manner of word, which <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is the Son; and but one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> proceeding after the manner of love, which <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p>The third reason is taken from the manner in which the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> proceed. For the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> proceed <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, as we have said (2), and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is determined to one.

<p>The fourth reason is taken from the perfection of the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. For this reason is the Son perfect, that the entire divine filiation is contained in Him, and that there is but one Son. The argument is similar in regard to the other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> We can grant, without distinction, that the Son has the same power as the Father; but we cannot grant that the Son has the power "generandi" [of begetting] thus taking "generandi" as the gerund of the active verb, so that the sense would be that the Son has the "power to beget." Just as, although Father and Son have the same being, it does not follow that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is the Father, by reason of the notional term added. But if the word "generandi" [of being begotten] is taken as the gerundive of the passive verb, the power "generandi" is in the Son--that is, the power of being begotten. The same is to be said if it be taken as the gerundive of an impersonal verb, so that the sense be "the power of generation"--that is, a power by which it is generated by some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> does not mean to say by those words that the Son could beget a Son: but that if He did not, it was not because He could not, as we shall see later on (42, 6, ad 3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Divine perfection and the total absence of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> require that there cannot be several Sons in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as we have explained. Wherefore that there are not several Sons is not due to any lack of begetting power in the Father.
