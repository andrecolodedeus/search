<h1>Question 41. The sacrament of Matrimony as directed to an office of nature</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5041.htm#article1"> Is it of natural law?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5041.htm#article2"> Is it a matter of precept?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5041.htm#article3"> Is its act lawful?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5041.htm#article4"> Can its act be meritorious?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether matrimony is of natural law?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that matrimony is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>. Because "the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> is what <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> has taught all animals" [Digest. I, i, de justitia et jure, 1.] But in other animals the sexes are united without matrimony. Therefore matrimony is not of <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> Further, that which is of <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> is found in all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> with regard to their every state. But <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> was not in every state of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, for as Tully says (De Inv. Rhet.), "at the beginning men were savages and then no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> his own children, nor was he bound by any marriage tie," wherein <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> consists. Therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things are the same among all. But <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> is not in the same way among all, since its practice varies according to the various laws. Therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, those things without which the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> can be maintained would seem not to be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>. But <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> intends the preservation of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> by generation which is possible without <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>, as in the case of fornicators. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> At the commencement of the Digests it is stated: "The union of male and female, which we call <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>, is of <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>."

<p>Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. viii, 12) says that "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is an animal more inclined by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to connubial than political society." But "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> a political and gregarious animal," as the same author asserts (Polit. i, 2). Therefore he is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> inclined to connubial union, and thus the conjugal union or <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing is said to be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> in two ways. First, as resulting of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> from the principles of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; thus upward movement is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to fire. In this way <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, nor are any of those things that come to pass at the intervention or motion of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. Secondly, that is said to be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to which <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> inclines although it comes to pass through the intervention of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>; thus acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> themselves are called <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>; and in this way <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, because <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> inclines thereto in two ways. First, in relation to the principal end of <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>, namely the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the offspring. For <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> intends not only the begetting of offspring, but also its education and development until it reach the perfect state of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and that is the state of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Hence, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. viii, 11,12), we derive three things from our parents, namely "<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>," "nourishment," and "<a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>." Now a child cannot be brought up and instructed unless it have certain and definite parents, and this would not be the case unless there were a tie between the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and a definite <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and it is in this that <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> consists. Secondly, in relation to the secondary end of <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>, which is the mutual services which <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> render one another in household matters. For just as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> dictates that men should live together, since one is not self-sufficient in all things concerning life, for which reason <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is described as being <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> inclined to political society, so too among those works that are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life some are becoming to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, others to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> inculcates that society of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> which consists in <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>. These two reasons are given by the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. viii, 11,12).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> inclines to a thing in two ways. In one way, because that thing is becoming to the generic <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and this is common to all animals; in another way because it is becoming to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the difference, whereby the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in so far as it is rational overflows the genus; such is an act of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> or <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>. And just as the generic <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, though one in all animals, yet is not in all in the same way, so neither does it incline in the same way in all, but in a way befitting each one. Accordingly <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> inclines to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> on the part of the difference, as regards the second reason given above; wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. viii, 11,12; Polit. i) gives this reason in men over other animals; but as regards the first reason it inclines on the part of the genus; wherefore he says that the begetting of offspring is common to all animals. Yet <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> does not incline thereto in the same way in all animals; since there are animals whose offspring are able to seek food immediately after birth, or are sufficiently fed by their mother; and in these there is no tie between male and female; whereas in those whose offspring needs the support of both parents, although for a short time, there is a certain tie, as may be seen in certain birds. In <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, however, since the child needs the parents' care for a long time, there is a very great tie between male and female, to which tie even the generic <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> inclines.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The assertion of Tully may be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of some particular nation, provided we understand it as referring to the proximate beginning of that nation when it became a nation distinct from others; for that to which <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> inclines is not realized in all things, and this statement is not universally <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, since <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> states that there has been <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> from the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vii) "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not unchangeable as the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is." Hence things that are of <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> vary according to the various states and <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; although those which <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> pertain to things Divine nowise vary.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Nature intends not only being in the offspring, but also perfect being, for which <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, as shown above.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether matrimony still comes under a precept?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> still comes under a precept. For a precept is binding so long as it is not recalled. But the primary institution of <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> came under a precept, as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 26); nor do we read anywhere that this precept was recalled, but rather that it was confirmed (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse6">Matthew 19:6</a>): "What . . . <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath joined together let no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> put asunder." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> still comes under a precept.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the precepts of <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> are binding in respect of all time. Now <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> is of <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore, etc.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is better than the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, "for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the State is more Godlike than the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" (Ethic. i, 2). Now the precept given to the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> concerning the preservation of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> by the act of the nutritive power is still in force. Much more therefore does the precept concerning <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> still hold, since it refers to the preservation of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, where the reason of an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> remains the same, the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> must remain the same. Now the reason why men were bound to marry in olden times was lest the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> should cease to multiply. Since then the result would be the same, if each one were free to abstain from marriage, it would seem that <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> comes under a precept.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse38">1 Corinthians 7:38</a>): "He that giveth not his <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> in marriage doth better [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'He that giveth his <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> in marriage doth well, and he that giveth her not doth better']," namely than he that giveth her in marriage. Therefore the contract of marriage is not now a matter of precept.

<p>Further, no one deserves a reward for breaking a precept. Now a special reward, namely the aureole, is due to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> [Cf. 96, 5]. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> does not come under a precept.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> inclines to a thing in two ways. In one way as to that which is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, and such an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> is binding on each one, since <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> perfections are common to all. In another way it inclines to that which is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the perfection of the community; and since there are many things of this kind, one of which hinders another, such an inclination does not bind each <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by way of precept; else each <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would be bound to husbandry and building and to such offices as are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> community; but the inclination of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is satisfied by the accomplishment of those various offices by various individuals. Accordingly, since the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> community requires that some should devote themselves to the contemplative life to which marriage is a very great obstacle, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination to marriage is not binding by way of precept even according to the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>. Hence Theophrastus proves that it is not advisable for a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to marry, as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> relates (Contra Jovin. i).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This precept has not been recalled, and yet it is not binding on each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, for the reason given above, except at that time when the paucity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> required each one to betake himself to the begetting of children.

<p>The Replies to objections 2 and 3 are clear from what has been said.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> has a general inclination to various offices and acts, as already stated. But since it is variously in various subjects, as individualized in this or that one, it inclines one subject more to one of those offices, and another subject more to another, according to the difference of temperament of various <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>. And it is owing to this difference, as well as to <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a> which governs all, that one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> chooses one office such as husbandry, and another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> another. And so it is too that some choose the <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> life and some the <a href="../cathen/04329a.htm">contemplative</a>. Wherefore no danger threatens.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the marriage act is always sinful?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the marriage act is always <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse29">1 Corinthians 7:29</a>): "That they . . . who have wives, be as if they had none." But those who are not <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> do not perform the marriage act. Therefore even those who are <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in that act.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "Your iniquities have divided between you and your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Now the marriage act divides <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wherefore the people who were to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<a href="../bible/exo019.htm#verse11">Exodus 19:11</a>) were commanded not to go near their wives (<a href="../bible/exo019.htm#verse20">Exodus 19:20</a>); and <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (Ep. ad Ageruch.: Contra Jovini, 18) that in the marriage act "the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> touches not the hearts of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>." Therefore it is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that which is shameful in itself can by no means be well done. Now the marriage act is always connected with <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, which is always shameful. Therefore it is always <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, nothing is the object of excuse save <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now the marriage act needs to be excused by the marriage blessings, as the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> says (Sent. iv, D, 26). Therefore it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, things alike in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are judged alike. But marriage intercourse is of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> as the act of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, since its end is the same, namely the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Therefore since the act of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the marriage act is likewise.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, excess in the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> corrupts <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now there is always excess of pleasure in the marriage act, so much so that it absorbs the reason which is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> principal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 11) that "in that act it is impossible to understand anything." Therefore the marriage act is always a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse28">1 Corinthians 7:28</a>): "If a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> marry she hath not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>," and (<a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse14">1 Timothy 5:14</a>): "I will . . . that the younger should marry," and "bear children." But there can be no bearing of children without carnal union. Therefore the marriage act is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; else the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> would not have approved of it.

<p>Further, no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a matter of precept. But the marriage act is a matter of precept (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse3">1 Corinthians 7:3</a>): "Let the husband render the debt to his life." Therefore it is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> If we suppose the corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to be <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> we cannot hold that those things which pertain to the preservation of the corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and to which <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> inclines, are altogether <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; wherefore, since the inclination to beget an offspring whereby the specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is preserved is from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it is impossible to maintain that the act of begetting children is altogether unlawful, so that it be impossible to find the mean of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> therein; unless we suppose, as some are mad enough to assert, that corruptible things were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> god, whence perhaps the opinion mentioned in the text is derived (Sent. iv, D, 26); wherefore this is a most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> By these words the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> did not forbid the marriage act, as neither did he forbid the possession of things when he said (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse31">1 Corinthians 7:31</a>): "They that use this world" (let them be) "as if they used it not." In each case he forbade enjoyment ["Fruitionem," i.e. enjoyment of a thing sought as one's last end]; which is clear from the way in which he expresses himself; for he did not say "let them not use it," or "let them not have them," but let them be "as if they used it not" and "as if they had none."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> We are united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and by the act of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> and love. Therefore whatever severs the former of these unions is always a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but not always that which severs the latter, since a lawful occupation about lower things distracts the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> so that it is not fit for actual union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and this is especially the case in carnal intercourse wherein the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is withheld by the intensity of pleasure. For this reason those who have to contemplate Divine things or handle sacred things are enjoined not to have to do with their wives for that particular time; and it is in this sense that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as regards the actual <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> of hidden things, did not touch the hearts of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> at the time of the marriage act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The shamefulness of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> that always accompanies the marriage act is a shamefulness not of guilt, but of punishment inflicted for the first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, inasmuch as the lower powers and the members do not obey reason. Hence the argument does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Properly speaking, a thing is said to be excused when it has some appearance of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and yet is not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, or not as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as it seems, because some things excuse wholly, others in part. And since the marriage act, by reason of the corruption of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, has the appearance of an inordinate act, it is wholly excused by the marriage <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>, so as not to be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Although they are the same as to their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, they differ as to their moral <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, which differs in respect of one circumstance, namely intercourse with one's wife and with another than one's wife; just as to kill a man by assault or by <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> differentiates the moral <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, although the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is the same; and yet the one is lawful and the other unlawful.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> The excess of <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> that corrupts <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> not only hinders the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, but also destroys the order of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. The intensity of pleasure in the marriage act does not do this, since, although for the moment <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not being directed, he was previously directed by his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the marriage act is meritorious?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the marriage act is not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> [Hom. i in the Opus Imperfectum, <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>] says in his commentary on Matthew: "Although marriage brings no punishment to those who use it, it affords them no meed." Now <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> bears a relation to meed. Therefore the marriage act is not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to refrain from what is <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> deserves not praise. Yet <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> whereby one refrains from marriage is praiseworthy. Therefore the marriage act is not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, he who avails himself of an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> granted him, avails himself of a favor received. But a man does not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> by receiving a favor. Therefore the marriage act is not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> like <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, consists in difficulty. But the marriage act affords not difficulty but pleasure. Therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, that which cannot be done without venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is never <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>, for a man cannot both <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> and demerit at the same time. Now there is always a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the marriage act, since even the first movement in such like pleasures is a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore the aforesaid act cannot be <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Every act whereby a precept is fulfilled is <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> if it be done from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Now such is the marriage act, for it is said (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse3">1 Corinthians 7:3</a>): "Let the husband render the debt to his wife." Therefore, etc.

<p>Further, every act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>. Now the aforesaid act is an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, for it is called the rendering of a debt. Therefore it is <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since no act proceeding from a deliberate <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is indifferent, as stated in the Second Book (Sent. ii, D, 40, 1, 3; I-II, 18, 9), the marriage act is always either <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> or <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> in one who is in a state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a>. For if the motive for the marriage act be a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, whether of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> that they may render the debt, or of religion, that they may beget children for the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>. But if the motive be <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, yet not excluding the marriage blessings, namely that he would by no means be willing to go to another <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, it is a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; while if he exclude the marriage blessings, so as to be disposed to act in like manner with any <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, it is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> cannot move without being either directed by reason, and thus it will be an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, or not so directed, and then it will be an act of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The root of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, as regards the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward, is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> itself; but as regards an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> reward, the reason for <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> consists in the difficulty of an act; and thus the marriage act is not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> except in the first way.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The difficulty required for <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> reward is a difficulty of labor, but the difficulty required for the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward is the difficulty of observing the mean, and this is the difficulty in the marriage act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> First movements in so far as they are venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are movements of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> to some inordinate object of pleasure. This is not the case in the marriage act, and consequently the argument does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>.
