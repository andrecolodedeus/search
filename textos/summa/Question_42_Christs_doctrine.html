<h1>Question 42. Christ's doctrine</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/4042.htm#article1"> Should Christ have preached to the Jews only, or to the Gentiles also?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4042.htm#article2"> In preaching, should He have avoided the opposition of the Jews?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4042.htm#article3"> Should He have preached in an open or in a hidden manner?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4042.htm#article4"> Should He have preached by word only, or also by writing?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether Christ should have preached not only to the Jews, but also to the Gentiles?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should have preached not only to the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, but also to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/isa049.htm#verse6">Isaiah 49:6</a>): "It is a small thing that thou shouldst be My servant to raise up the tribes of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: '<a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>'] and to convert the dregs of <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: '<a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>']: behold, I have given thee to be the light of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, that thou mayest be my <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> even to the farthest part of the earth." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> gave light and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> through His doctrine. Therefore it seems that it was "a small thing" that He preached to <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> alone, and not to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as it is written (<a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse29">Matthew 7:29</a>): "He was teaching them as one having power." Now the power of doctrine is made more manifest in the instruction of those who, like the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, have received no tidings whatever; hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse20">Romans 15:20</a>): "I have so preached the [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'this'] gospel, not where <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was named, lest I should build upon another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> foundation." Therefore much rather should <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> have preached to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> than to the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is more useful to instruct many than one. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> instructed some <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, such as the Samaritan <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> (<a href="../bible/joh004.htm">John 4</a>) and the Chananaean <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> (<a href="../bible/mat015.htm">Matthew 15</a>). Much more reason, therefore, was there for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to preach to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> in general.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat015.htm">Matthew 15:24</a>): "I was not sent but to the sheep that are lost of the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>." And (<a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse15">Romans 10:15</a>) it is written: "How shall they preach unless they be sent?" Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should not have preached to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It was fitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> preaching, whether through Himself or through His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, should be directed at first to the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> alone. First, in order to show that by His coming the promises were fulfilled which had been made to the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> of old, and not to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. Thus the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse8">Romans 15:8</a>): "I say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> . . . was minister of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>," i.e. the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> and preacher of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, "for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers."

<p>Secondly, in order to show that His coming was of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; because, as is written <a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse1">Romans 13:1</a>: "Those things which are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are well ordered [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'those that are, are ordained of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>']" [See Scriptural Index on this passage]. Now the right order demanded that the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> first to the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, who, by <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> in and worshiping one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, were nearer to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that it should be transmitted through them to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>: just as in the heavenly <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> the Divine enlightenment comes to the lower <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> through the higher. Hence on <a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse24">Matthew 15:24</a>, "I was not sent but to the sheep that are lost in the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>," <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says: "He does not mean by this that He was not sent to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, but that He was sent to the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> first." And so we read (<a href="../bible/isa066.htm#verse19">Isaiah 66:19</a>): "I will send of them that shall be saved," i.e. of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, "to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> . . . and they shall declare My <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> unto the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>."

<p>Thirdly, in order to deprive the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> of ground for quibbling. Hence on <a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse5">Matthew 10:5</a>, "Go ye not into the way of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>." <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says: "It behooved <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> coming to be announced to the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> first, lest they should have a valid excuse, and say that they had rejected <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> because He had sent His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> and Samaritans."

<p>Fourthly, because it was through the triumph of the cross that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> power and lordship over the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/rev002.htm#verse26">Apocalypse 2:26-28</a>): "He that shall overcome . . . I will give him power over the nations . . . as I also have received of My Father"; and that because He became "obedient unto the death of the cross, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath exalted Him . . . that in the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name of Jesus</a> every knee should bow . . ." and that "every tongue should confess Him" (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse8">Philippians 2:8-11</a>). Consequently He did not wish His doctrine to be preached to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> before His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>: it was after His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> that He said to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> (<a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew 28:19</a>): "Going, teach ye all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>." For this reason it was that when, shortly before His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, certain <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> wished to see <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, He said: "Unless the grain of wheat falling into the ground dieth, itself remaineth alone: but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit" (<a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse20">John 12:20-25</a>); and as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says, commenting on this passage: "He called Himself the grain of wheat that must be mortified by the unbelief of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, multiplied by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was given to be the light and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> through His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, whom He sent to preach to them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is a sign, not of lesser, but of greater power to do something by means of others rather than by oneself. And thus the Divine power of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was specially shown in this, that He bestowed on the teaching of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> such a power that they converted the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, although these had heard nothing of Him.

<p>Now the power of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> teaching is to be considered in the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> by which He confirmed His doctrine, in the efficacy of His persuasion, and in the authority of His words, for He spoke as being Himself above the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> when He said: "But I say to you" (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse22">Matthew 5:22-44</a>); and, again, in the force of His righteousness shown in His sinless manner of life.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Just as it was unfitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should at the outset make His doctrine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> equally with the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, in order that He might appear as being sent to the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, as to the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> people; so neither was it fitting for Him to neglect the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> altogether, lest they should be deprived of the hope of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For this reason certain <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> were admitted, on account of the excellence of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and devotedness.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether Christ should have preached to the Jews without offending them?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should have preached to the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> without offending them. For, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Agone Christ. xi): "In the Man <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, a model of life is given us by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>." But we should avoid offending not only the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, but even unbelievers, according to <a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse32">1 Corinthians 10:32</a>: "Be without offense to the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore it seems that, in His teaching, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should also have avoided giving offense to the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should do anything that will hinder the result of his labor. Now through the disturbance which His teaching occasioned among the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, it was deprived of its results; for it is written (<a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse53">Luke 11:53-54</a>) that when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> reproved the Pharisees and Scribes, they "began vehemently to urge Him, end to oppress His mouth about many things; lying in wait for Him, and seeking to catch something from His mouth, that they might accuse Him." It seems therefore unfitting that He should have given them offense by His teaching.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse1">1 Timothy 5:1</a>): "An ancient <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> rebuke not; but entreat him as a father." But the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and princes of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> were the elders of that people. Therefore it seems that they should not have been rebuked with severity.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It was foretold (<a href="../bible/isa008.htm#verse14">Isaiah 8:14</a>) that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> would be "for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to the two houses of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the multitude is to be preferred to the peace of any <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> whatsoever. Consequently, when certain ones, by their perverseness, hinder the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the multitude, the preacher and the teacher should not fear to offend those men, in order that he may insure the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the multitude. Now the Scribes and Pharisees and the princes of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> were by their <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> a considerable hindrance to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the people, both because they opposed themselves to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> doctrine, which was the only way to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and because their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> ways corrupted the morals of the people. For which reason <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>, undeterred by their taking offense, publicly taught the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>, and condemned their <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. Hence we read (<a href="../bible/mat015.htm">Matthew 15:12,14</a>) that when the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said: "Dost Thou <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, when they heard this word, were <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a>?" He answered: "Let them alone: they are blind and leaders of the blind; and if the blind lead the blind, both fall into the pit."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ought so to avoid giving offense, as neither by wrong <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> or word to be the occasion of anyone's downfall. "But if <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> arise from <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> should be borne rather than the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> be set aside," as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. vii in Ezech.).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> By publicly reproving the Scribes and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> promoted rather than hindered the effect of His teaching. Because when the people came to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> of those men, they were less inclined to be prejudiced against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by hearing what was said of Him by the Scribes and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, who were ever withstanding His doctrine.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This saying of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> is to be understood of those elders whose years are reckoned not only in age and authority, but also in probity; according to <a href="../bible/num011.htm#verse16">Numbers 11:16</a>: "Gather unto Me seventy men of the ancients of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, whom thou <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowest</a> to be ancients . . . of the people." But if by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> openly they turn the authority of their years into an instrument of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, they should be rebuked openly and severely, as also <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">Daniel</a> says (<a href="../bible/dan013.htm#verse52">Daniel 13:52</a>): "O thou that art grown old in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> days," etc.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether Christ should have taught all things openly?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should not have taught all things openly. For we read that He taught many things to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> apart: as is seen clearly in the sermon at the Supper. Wherefore He said: "That which you heard in the ear in the chambers shall be preached on the housetops" [<a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, probably quoting from <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, combines <a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse27">Matthew 10:27</a> with <a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse3">Luke 12:3</a>]. Therefore He did not teach all things openly.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the depths of wisdom should not be expounded save to the perfect, according to <a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse6">1 Corinthians 2:6</a>: "We speak wisdom among the perfect." Now Christ's doctrine contained the most profound wisdom. Therefore it should not have been made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the imperfect crowd.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it comes to the same, to hide the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, whether by saying nothing or by making use of a language that is difficult to understand. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by speaking to the multitudes a language they would not understand, hid from them the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that He preached; since "without parables He did not speak to them" (<a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse34">Matthew 13:34</a>). In the same way, therefore, He could have hidden it from them by saying nothing at all.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> He says Himself (<a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse20">John 18:20</a>): "In secret I have spoken nothing."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Anyone's doctrine may be hidden in three ways. First, on the part of the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the teacher, who does not wish to make his doctrine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to many, but rather to hide it. And this may happen in two ways--sometimes through <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> on the part of the teacher, who desires to excel in his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, wherefore he is unwilling to communicate it to others. But this was not the case with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in whose <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> the following words are spoken (<a href="../bible/wis007.htm#verse13">Wisdom 7:13</a>): "Which I have learned without guile, and communicate without <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, and her <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> I hide not." But sometimes this happens through the vileness of the things taught; thus <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says on <a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse12">John 16:12</a>: "There are some things so bad that no sort of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> modesty can bear them." Wherefore of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> doctrine it is written (<a href="../bible/pro009.htm#verse17">Proverbs 9:17</a>): "Stolen waters are sweeter." Now, Christ's doctrine is "not of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> nor of <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>" (<a href="../bible/1th002.htm#verse3">1 Thessalonians 2:3</a>). Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> says (<a href="../bible/mar004.htm#verse21">Mark 4:21</a>): "Doth a candle," i.e. <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and pure doctrine, "come in to be put under a bushel?"

<p>Secondly, doctrine is hidden because it is put before few. And thus, again, did <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> teach nothing in secret: for He propounded His entire doctrine either to the whole crowd or to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> gathered together. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says on <a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse20">John 18:20</a>: "How can it be said that He speaks in secret when He speaks before so many men? . . . especially if what He says to few He wishes through them to be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to many?"

<p>Thirdly, doctrine is hidden, as to the manner in which it is propounded. And thus <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> spoke certain things in secret to the crowds, by employing parables in teaching them <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> mysteries which they were either unable or unworthy to grasp: and yet it was better for them to be instructed in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, albeit hidden under the garb of parables, than to be deprived of it altogether. Nevertheless <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> expounded the open and unveiled <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of these parables to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, so that they might hand it down to others worthy of it; according to <a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse2">2 Timothy 2:2</a>: "The things which thou hast heard of me by many <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>, the same command to faithful men, who shall be fit to teach others." This is foreshadowed, <a href="../bible/num004.htm">Numbers 4</a>, where the sons of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> are commanded to wrap up the sacred vessels that were to be carried by the Levites.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says, commenting on the passage quoted, "we do not read that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> was wont to preach at night, and expound His doctrine in the dark: but He says this because His speech is darkness to the carnal-minded, and His words are night to the unbeliever. His meaning, therefore, is that whatever He said we also should say in the midst of unbelievers, by openly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> and professing it."

<p>Or, according to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, He speaks comparatively--that is to say, because He was instructing them in Judea, which was a small place compared with the whole world, where Christ's doctrine was to be published by the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> By His doctrine our Lord did not make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> all the depths of His wisdom, neither to the multitudes, nor, indeed, to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, to whom He said (<a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse12">John 16:12</a>): "I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now." Yet whatever things out of His wisdom He judged it right to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to others, He expounded, not in secret, but openly; although He was not understood by all. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says on <a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse20">John 18:20</a>: "We must understand this, 'I have spoken openly to the world,' as though <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> had said, 'Many have heard Me' . . . and, again, it was not 'openly,' because they did not understand."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> spoke to the multitudes in parables, because they were neither able nor worthy to receive the naked <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which He revealed to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.

<p>And when it is said that "without parables He did not speak to them," according to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> (Hom. xlvii in Matth.), we are to understand this of that particular sermon, since on other occasions He said many things to the multitude without parables. Or, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Qq. Evang., qu. xvii), this means, "not that He spoke nothing literally, but that He scarcely ever spoke without introducing a parable, although He also spoke some things in the literal sense."

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether Christ should have committed His doctrine to writing?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should have committed His doctrine to writing. For the purpose of writing is to hand down doctrine to posterity. Now Christ's doctrine was destined to endure for ever, according to <a href="../bible/luk021.htm#verse33">Luke 21:33</a>: "Heaven and earth shall pass away, but My words shall not pass away." Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should have committed His doctrine to writing.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was a foreshadowing of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to <a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse1">Hebrews 10:1</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> has [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'having'] a shadow of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to come." Now the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was put into writing by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/exo024.htm#verse12">Exodus 24:12</a>: "I will give thee" two "tables of stone and the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and the commandments which I have written." Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> also should have put His doctrine into writing.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who came to enlighten them that sit in darkness (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse79">Luke 1:79</a>), it belonged to remove occasions of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and to open out the road to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Now He would have done this by putting His teaching into writing: for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Consensu Evang. i) that "some there are who wonder why <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> wrote nothing, so that we have to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what others have written about Him. Especially do those <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> ask this question who dare not blame or <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and who ascribe to Him most excellent, but merely <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, wisdom. These say that the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> made out the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Master</a> to be more than He really was when they said that He was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, by whom all things were made." And farther on he adds: "It seems as though they were prepared to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> whatever He might have written of Himself, but not what others at their discretion published about Him." Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should have Himself committed His doctrine to writing.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> No books written by Him were to be found in the canon of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It was fitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should not commit His doctrine to writing. First, on account of His dignity: for the more excellent the teacher, the more excellent should be his manner of teaching. Consequently it was fitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as the most excellent of teachers, should adopt that manner of teaching whereby His doctrine is imprinted on the hearts of His hearers; wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse29">Matthew 7:29</a>) that "He was teaching them as one having power." And so it was that among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagoras</a> and <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a>, who were teachers of great excellence, were unwilling to write anything. For writings are ordained, as to an end, unto the imprinting of doctrine in the hearts of the hearers.

<p>Secondly, on account of the excellence of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> doctrine, which cannot be expressed in writing; according to <a href="../bible/joh021.htm#verse25">John 21:25</a>: "There are also many other things which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> did: which, if they were written everyone, the world itself, I think, would not be able to contain the books that should be written." Which <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> explains by saying: "We are not to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that in respect of space the world could not contain them . . . but that by the capacity of the readers they could not be comprehended." And if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had committed His doctrine to writing, men would have had no deeper thought of His doctrine than that which appears on the surface of the writing.

<p>Thirdly, that His doctrine might reach all in an orderly manner: Himself teaching His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> immediately, and they subsequently teaching others, by preaching and writing: whereas if He Himself had written, His doctrine would have reached all immediately.

<p>Hence it is said of Wisdom (<a href="../bible/pro009.htm#verse3">Proverbs 9:3</a>) that "she hath sent her maids to invite to the tower." It is to be observed, however, that, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Consensu Evang. i), some of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> thought that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> wrote certain books treating of the magic art whereby He worked <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>: which art is condemned by the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> learning. "And yet they who claim to have read those books of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> do none of those things which they marvel at His doing according to those same books. Moreover, it is by a <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">Divine judgment</a> that they <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> so far as to assert that these books were, as it were, entitled as letters to Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, for that they found them in several places depicted in company with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. No wonder that the inventors were deceived by the painters: for as long as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> lived in the mortal flesh with His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was no disciple of His."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in the same book: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the head of all His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> who are members of His body. Consequently, when they put into writing what He showed forth and said to them, by no means must we say that He wrote nothing: since His members put forth that which they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> under His dictation. For at His command they, being His hands, as it were, wrote whatever He wished us to read concerning His <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> and words."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Since the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">old Law</a> was given under the form of sensible signs, therefore also was it fittingly written with sensible signs. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> doctrine, which is "the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the spirit of life" (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse2">Romans 8:2</a>), had to be "written not with ink, but with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; not in tables of stone, but in the fleshly tables of the heart," as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse3">2 Corinthians 3:3</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Those who were unwilling to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> wrote of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> would have refused to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the writings of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, whom they deemed to work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> by the magic art.
