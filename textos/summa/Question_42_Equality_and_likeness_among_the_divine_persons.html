<h1>Question 42. Equality and likeness among the divine persons</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1042.htm#article1"> Is there equality among the divine persons?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1042.htm#article2"> Is the person who proceeds equal to the one from Whom He proceeds in eternity?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1042.htm#article3"> Is there any order among the divine persons?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1042.htm#article4"> Are the divine persons equal in greatness?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1042.htm#article5"> Is the one divine person in another?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1042.htm#article6"> Are they equal in power?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether there is equality in God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that equality is not becoming to the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. For equality is in relation to things which are one in <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. v, text 20). But in the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> there is no <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, neither continuous intrinsic <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, which we call size, nor continuous extrinsic <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, which we call place and time. Nor can there be equality by reason of discrete <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, because two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are more than one. Therefore equality is not becoming to the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are of one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, as we have said (39, 2). Now <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is signified by way of form. But agreement in <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> makes things to be alike, not to be equal. Therefore, we may speak of likeness in the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, but not of equality.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, things wherein there is to be found equality, are equal to one another, for equality is reciprocal. But the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> cannot be said to be equal to one another. For as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. vi, 10): "If an image answers perfectly to that whereof it is the image, it may be said to be equal to it; but that which it represents cannot be said to be equal to the image." But the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is the image of the Father; and so the Father is not equal to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. Therefore equality is not to be found among the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, equality is a relation. But no relation is common to the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; for the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are distinct by reason of the relations. Therefore equality is not becoming to the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> says that "the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are co-<a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and co-equal to one another."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We must needs admit equality among the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. For, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. x, text 15,16, 17), equality signifies the negation of greater or less. Now we cannot admit anything greater or less in the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; for as <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Trin. i): "They must needs admit a difference [namely, of Godhead] who speak of either increase or decrease, as the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> do, who sunder the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> by distinguishing degrees as of numbers, thus involving a plurality." Now the reason of this is that unequal things cannot have the same <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. But <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is nothing else than His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Wherefore it follows, that if there were any inequality in the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, they would not have the same <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; and thus the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> would not be one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; which is impossible. We must therefore admit equality among the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">Quantity</a> is twofold. There is <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of "bulk" or dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, which is to be found only in corporeal things, and has, therefore, no place in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. There is also <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>," which is measured according to the perfection of some <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or form: to this sort of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> we allude when we speak of something as being more, or less, hot; forasmuch as it is more or less, perfect in heat. Now this virtual <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> is measured firstly by its source--that is, by the perfection of that form or <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: such is the greatness of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, just as we speak of great heat on account of its intensity and perfection. And so <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. vi, 18) that "in things which are great, but not in bulk, to be greater is to be better," for the more perfect a thing is the better it is.

<p>Secondly, virtual <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> is measured by the effects of the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Now the first effect of form is being, for everything has being by reason of its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. The second effect is operation, for every agent acts through its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Consequently virtual <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> is measured both in regard to being and in regard to action: in regard to being, forasmuch as things of a more perfect <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> are of longer duration; and in regard to action, forasmuch as things of a more perfect <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> are more powerful to act. And so as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Fulgentius, De Fide ad Petrum i) says: "We understand equality to be in the Father, Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, inasmuch as no one of them either precedes in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, or excels in greatness, or surpasses in power."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Where we have equality in respect of virtual <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, equality includes likeness and something besides, because it excludes excess. For whatever things have a common form may be said to be alike, even if they do not participate in that form equally, just as the air may be said to be like fire in heat; but they cannot be said to be equal if one participates in the form more perfectly than another. And because not only is the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in both Father and Son, but also is it in both in perfect equality, therefore we say not only that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is like to the Father, in order to exclude the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of Eunomius, but also that He is equal to the Father to exclude the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Equality and likeness in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may be designated in two ways--namely, by nouns and by verbs. When designated by nouns, equality in the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is mutual, and so is likeness; for the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is equal and like to the Father, and conversely. This is because the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is not more the Father's than the Son's. Wherefore, just as the Son has the greatness of the Father, and is therefore equal to the Father, so the Father has the greatness of the Son, and is therefore equal to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. But in reference to creatures, <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. ix): "Equality and likeness are not mutual." For effects are said to be like their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, inasmuch as they have the form of their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>; but not conversely, for the form is principally in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and secondarily in the effect.

<p>But verbs signify equality with movement. And although movement is not in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, there is something that receives. Since, therefore, the Son receives from the Father, this, namely, that He is equal to the Father, and not conversely, for this reason we say that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is equalled to the Father, but not conversely.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> In the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> there is nothing for us to consider but the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> which they have in common and the relations in which they are distinct. Now equality implies both --namely, distinction of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, for nothing can be said to be equal to itself; and unity of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, since for this reason are the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> equal to one another, that they are of the same greatness and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Now it is clear that the relation of a thing to itself is not a real relation. Nor, again, is one relation referred to another by a further relation: for when we say that paternity is opposed to filiation, opposition is not a relation mediating between paternity and filiation. For in both these cases relation would be multiplied indefinitely. Therefore equality and likeness in the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is not a real relation distinct from the personal relations: but in its concept it includes both the relations which distinguish the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and the unity of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. For this reason the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> says (Sent. i, D, xxxi) that in these "it is only the terms that are relative."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the person proceeding is co-eternal with His principle, as the Son with the Father?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> proceeding is not co-<a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> with His principle, as the Son with the Father. For <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> gives twelve modes of generation. The first mode is like the issue of a line from a point; wherein is wanting equality of simplicity. The second is like the emission of rays from the sun; wherein is absent equality of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. The third is like the mark or impression made by a seal; wherein is wanting consubstantiality and executive power. The fourth is the infusion of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; wherein also consubstantiality is wanting. The fifth is the emanation of an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> from its subject; but the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> has no subsistence. The sixth is the abstraction of a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as sense receives the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the sensible object; wherein is wanting equality of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> simplicity. The seventh is the exciting of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which excitation is merely temporal. The eighth is transformation, as an image is made of brass; which transformation is material. The ninth is motion from a mover; and here again we have effect and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. The tenth is the taking of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from genera; but this mode has no place in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for the Father is not predicated of the Son as the genus of a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. The eleventh is the realization of an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> [ideatio], as an external coffer arises from the one in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. The twelfth is birth, as a man is begotten of his father; which implies priority and posteriority of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Thus it is clear that equality of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or of time is absent in every mode whereby one thing is from another. So if the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is from the Father, we must say that He is less than the Father, or later than the Father, or both.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, everything that comes from another has a principle. But nothing <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> has a principle. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is not <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>; nor is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, everything which is corrupted ceases to be. Hence everything generated begins to be; for the end of generation is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is generated by the Father. Therefore He begins to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, and is not co-<a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> with the Father.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, if the Son be begotten by the Father, either He is always being begotten, or there is some moment in which He is begotten. If He is always being begotten, since, during the process of generation, a thing must be imperfect, as appears in successive things, which are always in process of becoming, as time and motion, it follows that the Son must be always imperfect, which cannot be admitted. Thus there is a moment to be assigned for the begetting of the Son, and before that moment the Son did not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> declares that "all the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are co-<a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> with each other."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We must say that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is co-<a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> with the Father. In <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of which we must consider that for a thing which proceeds from a principle to be posterior to its principle may be due to two reasons: one on the part of the agent, and the other on the part of the action. On the part of the agent this happens differently as regards free agents and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> agents. In free agents, on account of the choice of time; for as a free agent can choose the form it gives to the effect, as stated above (Question 41, Article 2), so it can choose the time in which to produce its effect. In <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> agents, however, the same happens from the agent not having its perfection of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power from the very first, but obtaining it after a certain time; as, for instance, a man is not able to generate from the very first. Considered on the part of action, anything derived from a principle cannot <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> simultaneously with its principle when the action is successive. So, given that an agent, as soon as it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>, begins to act thus, the effect would not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the same instant, but in the instant of the action's termination. Now it is manifest, according to what has been said (41, 2), that the Father does not beget the Son by will, but by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and also that the Father's <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was perfect from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>; and again that the action whereby the Father produces the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is not successive, because thus the Son would be successively generated, and this generation would be material, and accompanied with movement; which is quite impossible. Therefore we conclude that the Son <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> whensoever the Father <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> and thus the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is co-<a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> with the Father, and likewise the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is co-<a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> with both.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Verbis Domini, Serm. 38), no mode of the procession of any creature perfectly represents the divine generation. Hence we need to gather a likeness of it from many of these modes, so that what is wanting in one may be somewhat supplied from another; and thus it is declared in the council of Ephesus: "Let Splendor tell thee that the co-<a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Son <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> always with the Father; let the Word announce the impassibility of His birth; let the name Son insinuate His consubstantiality." Yet, above them all the procession of the word from the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> represents it more exactly; the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> word not being posterior to its source except in an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> passing from <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to act; and this cannot be said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">Eternity</a> excludes the principle of duration, but not the principle of origin.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Every corruption is a change; and so all that corrupts begins not to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> and ceases to be. The divine generation, however, is not changed, as stated above (Question 27, Article 2). Hence the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is ever being begotten, and the Father is always begetting.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> In time there is something indivisible--namely, the instant; and there is something else which endures--namely, time. But in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> the indivisible "now" stands ever still, as we have said above (10, 2 ad 1, 4 ad 2). But the generation of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is not in the "now" of time, or in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, but in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. And so to express the presentiality and permanence of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, we can say that "He is ever being born," as <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> said (Hom. in Joan. i). But as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> [Moral. xxix, 21] and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [Super Ps. 2:7 said, it is better to say "ever born," so that "ever" may denote the permanence of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, and "born" the perfection of the only Begotten. Thus, therefore, neither is the Son imperfect, nor "was there a time when He was not," as <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> said.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether in the divine persons there exists an order of nature?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that among the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> there does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> an order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For whatever <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, or a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, or a notion. But the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> does not signify the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, nor any of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, or notions. Therefore there is no order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, wherever order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>, there one comes before another, at least, according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. But in the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> neither priority nor posteriority, as declared by <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>. Therefore, in the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> there is no order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, wherever order <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>, distinction also <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>. But there is no distinction in the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore it is not subject to order; and order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in it.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. But there is no order of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore neither is there of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Where plurality <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> without order, confusion <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>. But in the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> there is no confusion, as <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> says. Therefore in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> order <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Order always has reference to some principle. Wherefore since there are many kinds of principle--namely, according to site, as a point; according to <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as the principle of demonstration; and according to each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>--so are there many kinds of order. Now principle, according to origin, without priority, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as we have stated (33, 1): so there must likewise be order according to origin, without priority; and this is called 'the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>': in the words of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Contra Maxim. iv): "Not whereby one is prior to another, but whereby one is from another."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> signifies the notion of origin in general, not a special kind of origin.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In things <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>, even when what is derived from a principle is co-equal in duration with its principle, the principle still comes first in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and reason, if formally considered as principle. If, however, we consider the relations of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and effect, or of the principle and the thing proceeding therefrom, it is clear that the things so related are simultaneous in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and reason, inasmuch as the one enters the definition of the other. But in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the relations themselves are the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> subsisting in one <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. So, neither on the part of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, nor on the part the relations, can one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> be prior to another, not even in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> means not the ordering of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> itself, but the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of order in the divine Persons according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> origin.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> in a certain way implies the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a principle, but <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> does not; and so the order of origin is more correctly called the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> than the order of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the Son is equal to the Father in greatness?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is not equal to the Father in greatness. For He Himself said (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse28">John 14:28</a>): "The Father is greater than I"; and the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse28">1 Corinthians 15:28</a>): "The Son Himself shall be subject to Him that put all things under Him."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, paternity is part of the Father's dignity. But paternity does not belong to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. Therefore the Son does not possess all the Father's dignity; and so He is not equal in greatness to the Father.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, wherever there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> a whole and a part, many parts are more than one only, or than fewer parts; as three men are more than two, or than one. But in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> a universal whole <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>, and a part; for under relation or notion, several notions are included. Therefore, since in the Father there are three notions, while in the Son there are only two, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is evidently not equal to the Father.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse6">Philippians 2:6</a>): "He thought it not robbery to be equal with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The Son is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> equal to the Father in greatness. For the greatness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is nothing but the perfection of His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now it belongs to the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of paternity and filiation that the Son by generation should attain to the possession of the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which is in the Father, in the same way as it is in the Father Himself. But since in men generation is a certain kind of transmutation of one proceeding from <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to act, it follows that a man is not equal at first to the father who begets him, but attains to equality by due growth, unless owing to a defect in the principle of generation it should happen otherwise. From what precedes (27, 2; 33, 2,3), it is evident that in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> real <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> paternity and filiation. Nor can we say that the power of generation in the Father was defective, nor that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> arrived at perfection in a successive manner and by change. Therefore we must say that the Son was <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> equal to the Father in greatness. Hence, <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (De Synod. Can. 27): "Remove bodily weakness, remove the beginning of conception, remove pain and all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> shortcomings, then every son, by reason of his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> nativity, is the father's equal, because he has a like <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> These words are to be understood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, wherein He is less than the Father, and subject to Him; but in His divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> He is equal to the Father. This is expressed by <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, "Equal to the Father in His Godhead; less than the Father in humanity": and by <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> (De Trin. ix): "By the fact of giving, the Father is greater; but He is not less to Whom the same being is given"; and (De Synod.): "The Son subjects Himself by His inborn piety"--that is, by His recognition of paternal authority; whereas "creatures are subject by their <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> weakness."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Equality is measured by greatness. In <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> greatness signifies the perfection of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as above explained (1, ad 1), and belongs to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Thus equality and likeness in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> have reference to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; nor can there be inequality or dissimilitude arising from the distinction of the relations. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Maxim. iii, 13), "The question of origin is, Who is from whom? but the question of equality is, Of what kind, or how great, is he?" Therefore, paternity is the Father's dignity, as also the Father's <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>: since dignity is something absolute, and pertains to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. As, therefore, the same <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, which in the Father is paternity, in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is filiation, so the same dignity which, in the Father is paternity, in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is filiation. It is thus <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to say that the Son possesses whatever dignity the Father has; but we cannot argue--"the Father has paternity, therefore the Son has paternity," for there is a transition from <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> to relation. For the Father and the Son have the same <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and dignity, which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the Father by the relation of giver, and in the Son by relation of receiver.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> relation is not a universal whole, although it is predicated of each of the relations; because all the relations are one in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and being, which is irreconcilable with the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of universal, the parts of which are distinguished in being. Persons likewise is not a universal term in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as we have seen above (Question 30, Article 4). Wherefore all the relations together are not greater than only one; nor are all the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> something greater than only one; because the whole perfection of the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in each <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the Son is in the Father, and conversely?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the Son and the Father are not in each other. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (<em>Phys.</em> iv, text. 23) gives eight modes of one thing <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in another, according to none of which is the Son in the Father, or conversely; as is patent to anyone who examines each mode. Therefore the Son and the Father are not in each other.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, nothing that has come out from another is within it. But the Son from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> came out from the Father, according to Micheas v. 2: "His going forth is from the beginning, from the days of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is not in the Father.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, one of two opposites cannot be in the other. But the Son and the Father are relatively opposed. Therefore one cannot be in the other.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse10">John 14:10</a>): "I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There are three points of consideration as regards the Father and the Son; the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, the relation, and the origin; and according to each the Son and the Father are in each other. The Father is in the Son by His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, forasmuch as the Father is His own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, and communicates His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> to the Son not by any change on His part. Hence it follows that as the Father's <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is in the Son, the Father Himself is in the Son; likewise, since the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is His own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, it follows that He Himself is in the Father in Whom is His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. This is expressed by <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> (<em>De Trin.</em> v), "The unchangeable <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so to speak, follows His own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in begetting an unchangeable subsisting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. So we understand the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to subsist in Him, for He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." It is also manifest that as regards the relations, each of two relative opposites is in the concept of the other. Regarding origin also, it is clear that the procession of the intelligible word is not outside the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, inasmuch as it remains in the utterer of the word. What also is uttered by the word is therein contained. And the same applies to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> What is contained in creatures does not sufficiently represent what <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; so according to none of the modes enumerated by the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a>, are the Son and the Father in each other. The mode the most nearly approaching to the reality is to be found in that whereby something <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in its originating principle, except that the unity of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> between the principle and that which proceeds therefrom is wanting in things <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The Son's going forth from the Father is by mode of the intereior procession whereby the word emerges from the heart and remains therein. Hence this going forth in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is only by the distinction of the relations, not by any kind of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> separation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The Father and the Son are relatively opposed, but not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>; while, as above explained, one relative opposite is in the other.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the Son is equal to the Father in power?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is not equal to the Father in power. For it is said (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse19">John 5:19</a>): "The Son cannot do anything of Himself but what He seeth the Father doing." But the Father can act of Himself. Therefore the Father's power is greater than the Son's.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, greater is the power of him who commands and teaches than of him who obeys and hears. But the Father commands the Son according to <a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse31">John 14:31</a>: "As the Father gave Me commandment so do I." The Father also teaches the Son: "The Father loveth the Son, and showeth Him all things that Himself doth" (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse20">John 5:20</a>). Also, the Son hears: "As I hear, so I judge" (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse30">John 5:30</a>). Therefore the Father has greater power than the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it belongs to the Father's omnipotence to be able to beget a Son equal to Himself. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Maxim. iii, 7), "Were He unable to beget one equal to Himself, where would be the omnipotence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father?" But the Son cannot beget a Son, as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> above (Question 41, Article 6). Therefore the Son cannot do all that belongs to the Father's omnipotence; and hence He is not equal to Him power.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse19">John 5:19</a>): "Whatsoever things the Father doth, these the Son also doth in like manner."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The Son is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> equal to the Father in power. Power of action is a consequence of perfection in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. In creatures, for instance, we see that the more perfect the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the greater power is there for action. Now it was shown above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>) that the very notion of the divine paternity and filiation requires that the Son should be the Father's equal in greatness--that is, in perfection of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence it follows that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is equal to the Father in power; and the same applies to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> in relation to both.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The words, "the Son cannot of Himself do anything," do not withdraw from the Son any power possessed by the Father, since it is immediately added, "Whatsoever things the Father doth, the Son doth in like manner"; but their meaning is to show that the Son derives His power from the Father, of Whom He receives His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence, <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (De Trin. ix), "The unity of the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> implies that the Son so acts of Himself [per se], that He does not act by Himself [a se]."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The Father's "showing" and the Son's "hearing" are to be taken in the sense that the Father communicates <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to the Son, as He communicates His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. The command of the Father can be explained in the same sense, as giving Him from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and will to act, by begetting Him. Or, better still, this may be referred to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As the same <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is paternity in the Father, and filiation in the Son: so by the same power the Father begets, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is begotten. Hence it is clear that the Son can do whatever the Father can do; yet it does not follow that the Son can beget; for to argue thus would imply transition from <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> to relation, for generation signifies a divine relation. So the Son has the same omnipotence as the Father, but with another relation; the Father possessing power as "giving" signified when we say that He is able to beget; while the Son possesses the power of "receiving," signified by saying that He can be begotten.
