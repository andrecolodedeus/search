<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether matrimony is a sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. For every sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> has a form that is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> given by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at a wedding is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>. Therefore it is not a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> according to Hugh (De Sacram. i) is "a material element." But <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> has not a material element for its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Therefore it is not a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> derive their efficacy from <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>. But <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>, since it has pleasure annexed to it, does not conform <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, which was painful. Therefore it is not a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, every sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> that which it signifies. Yet <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the union of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which union it signifies. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, in the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> there is something which is reality and sacrament. But this is not to be found in <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>, since it does not imprint a character, else it would not be repeated. Therefore it is not a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse32">Ephesians 5:32</a>): "This is a great sacrament." Therefore, etc.

<p>Further, a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is the sign of a sacred thing. But such is Matrimony. Therefore, etc.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A sacrament denotes a sanctifying remedy against <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> offered to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> under sensible signs [Cf. III, 61, 1; III, 65, 1]. Wherefore since this is the case in <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>, it is reckoned among the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The words whereby the marriage consent is expressed are the form of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, and not the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>, which is a sacramental.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The sacrament of Matrimony, like that of Penance, is perfected by the act of the recipient. Wherefore just as Penance has no other <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> than the sensible acts themselves, which take the place of the material element, so it is in Matrimony.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although Matrimony is not conformed to <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> as regards pain, it is as regards <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, whereby He suffered for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> who was to be united to Him as His spouse.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The union of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is not the reality contained in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but is the reality signified and not contained--and no sacrament <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a reality of that kind--but it has another both contained and signified which it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, as we shall state further on (ad 5). The <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a>, however (Sent. iv, D, 26), asserts that it is a non-contained reality, because he was of opinion that Matrimony has no reality contained therein.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> In this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> also those three things [Cf. III, 66, 1] are to be found, for the acts externally apparent are the sacrament only; the bond between husband and wife resulting from those acts is reality and sacrament; and the ultimate reality contained is the effect of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, while the non-contained reality is that which the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> assigns (Sent. iv, D, 26).

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether this sacrament ought to have been instituted before sin was committed?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that Matrimony ought not to have been instituted before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Because that which is of <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> needs not to be instituted. Now such is Matrimony, as stated above (Question 41, Article 1). Therefore it ought not to have been instituted.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are medicines against the disease of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But a medicine is not made ready except for an actual disease. Therefore it should not have been instituted before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, one institution suffices for one thing. Now Matrimony was instituted also after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 26). Therefore it was not instituted before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the institution of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> must come from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the words relating to Matrimony were not definitely said by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> but by <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>; the words which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> uttered (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse22">Genesis 1:22</a>), "Increase and multiply," were addressed also to the brute creation where there is no marriage. Therefore Matrimony was not instituted before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, Matrimony is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> took their origin from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore it ought not to have been instituted before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse4">Matthew 19:4</a>): "Have ye not read that He Who made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from the beginning 'made them male and female'"?

<p>Further, Matrimony was instituted for the begetting of children. But the begetting of children was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore it behooved Matrimony to be instituted before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> inclines to marriage with a certain <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in view, which <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> varies according to the different states of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, wherefore it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> to be variously instituted in the various states of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in reference to that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Consequently <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> as directed to the begetting of children, which was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> even when there was no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, was instituted before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; according as it affords a remedy for the wound of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it was instituted after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> at the time of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>; its institution belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic Law</a> as regards personal disqualifications; and it was instituted in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> in so far as it represents the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> union with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and in this respect it is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>. As regards other advantages resulting from <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>, such as the friendship and mutual services which husband and wife render one another, its institution belongs to the <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>. Since, however, a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> a sign and a remedy, it follows that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of sacrament applies to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> as regards the intermediate institution; that it is fittingly intended to fulfill an office of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as regards the first institution; and. as regards the last-mentioned institution, that it is directed to fulfill an office of society.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Things which are of <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> in a general way, need to be instituted as regards their determination which is subject to variation according to various states; just as it is of <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> that evil-doers be punished, but that such and such a punishment be appointed for such and such a crime is determined by positive <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Matrimony is not only for a remedy against <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but is chiefly for an office of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and thus it was instituted before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, not as intended for a remedy.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There is no reason why <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> should not have had several institutions corresponding to the various things that had to be determined in connection with marriage. Hence these various institutions are not of the same thing in the same respect.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> was instituted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when He fashioned a helpmate for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> out of his rib, and said to them: "Increase and multiply." And although this was said also to the other animals, it was not to be fulfilled by them in the same way as by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. As to <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam's</a> words, he uttered them inspired by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to understand that the institution of marriage was from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> As was clearly stated, <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> was not instituted before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether matrimony confers grace?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> does not confer <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For, according to Hugh (De Sacram. i) "the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, by virtue of their sanctification, confer an invisible <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>." But <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> has no sanctification <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to it. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not conferred therein.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every sacrament that confers <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> confers it by virtue of its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Now the acts which are the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> are not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> (for it would be the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Pelagius to assert that our acts <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>); and the words expressive of consent are not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, since no sanctification results from them. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is by no means given in <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that is directed against the wound of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to all who have that wound. Now the wound of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is to be found in all. Therefore if <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> were given in <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> against the wound of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> ought to contract marriage, and it would be very stupid to refrain from <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, sickness does not seek a remedy where it finds aggravation. Now <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is aggravated by <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, because, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iii, 12), "the desire of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is insatiable, and is increased by congenial actions." Therefore it would seem that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not conferred in <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>, as a remedy for <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Definition and thing defined should be convertible. Now <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is included in the definition of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Since, then, <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, it is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Bono Viduit. viii; Gen. ad lit. ix, 7) that "<a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> affords a remedy to the sick." But it is not a remedy except in so far as it has some efficacy. Therefore it has some efficacy for the repression of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is not repressed except by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is conferred therein.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There have been three opinions on this point. For some [<a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>, Sent. iv, D, 2 said that <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> is nowise the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but only a sign thereof. But this cannot be maintained, for in that case it would in no respect surpass the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. Wherefore there would be no reason for reckoning it among the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>; since even in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> by the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the act it was able to afford a remedy to <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> lest the latter run riot when held in too strict restraint.

<p>Hence others [<a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">St. Albert Magnus</a>, Sent. iv, D, 26 said that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is conferred therein as regards the withdrawal from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, because the act is excused from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for it would be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> apart from <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>. But this would be too little, since it had this also in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. And so they say that it makes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> withdraw from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, by restraining the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> lest it tend to something outside the marriage blessings, but that this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> does not enable a man to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works. But this cannot be maintained, since the same <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> hinders <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and inclines to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, just as the same heat expels cold and gives heat.

<p>Hence others [<a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a>, Sent. iv, D, 26 say that <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>, inasmuch as it is contracted in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, is able to confer the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which enables us to do those works which are required in <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>. and this is more probable, since wherever <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gives the faculty to do a thing, He gives also the helps whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is enabled to make becoming use of that faculty; thus it is clear that to all the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> powers there correspond bodily members by which they can proceed to act. Therefore, since in <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> receives by Divine institution the faculty to use his wife for the begetting of children, he also receives the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> without which he cannot becomingly do so; just as we have said of the sacrament of orders (35, 1). And thus this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which is given is the last thing contained in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Just as the baptismal water by virtue of its contact with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body [Cf. III, 66, 3, ad 4] is able to "touch the body and cleanse the heart" [<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, Tract. lxxx in Joan.], so is <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> able to do so through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> having represented it by His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, and not principally through any <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as the water of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> together with the form of words results immediately not in the infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but in the imprinting of the character, so the outward acts and the words expressive of consent directly effect a certain tie which is the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>; and this tie by virtue of its Divine institution works dispositively [Cf. 18, 1], where <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> uses the same expression; and Editor's notes at the beginning of the Supplement and on that Article] to the infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument would hold if no more efficacious remedy could be employed against the disease of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>; but a yet more powerful remedy is found in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> works and mortification of the flesh by those who make no use of <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> A remedy can be employed against <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> in two ways. First, on the part of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> by repressing it in its root, and thus <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> affords a remedy by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> given therein. Secondly, on the part of its act, and this in two ways: first, by depriving the act to which <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> inclines of its outward shamefulness, and this is done by the marriage blessings which justify carnal <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>; secondly, by hindering the shameful act, which is done by the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the act. because <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, being satisfied by the conjugal act, does not incline so much to other <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. For this reason the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse9">1 Corinthians 7:9</a>): "It is better to marry than to burn." For though the works congenial to <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> are in themselves of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to increase <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, yet in so far as they are directed according to reason they repress <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, because like acts result in like dispositions and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether carnal intercourse is an integral part of this sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that carnal intercourse is an integral part of marriage. For at the very institution of marriage it was declared (<a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse24">Genesis 2:24</a>): "They shall be two in one flesh." Now this is not brought about save by carnal intercourse. Therefore it is an integral part of marriage.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which belongs to the signification of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as we have stated above (2; 9, 1). Now carnal intercourse belongs to the signification of <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>, as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 26). Therefore it is an integral part of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is directed to the preservation of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> cannot be preserved without carnal intercourse. Therefore it is an integral part of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, Matrimony is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> inasmuch as it affords a remedy against <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>; according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle's</a> saying (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse9">1 Corinthians 7:9</a>): "It is better to marry than to burn." But it does not afford this remedy to those who have no carnal intercourse. Therefore the same conclusion follows as before.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> There was <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> in Paradise, and yet there was no carnal intercourse. Therefore carnal intercourse is not an integral part of <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>.

<p>Further, a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> by its very name denotes a sanctification. But <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holier</a> without carnal intercourse, according to the text (Sent. D, 26). Therefore carnal intercourse is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Integrity is twofold. One regards the primal perfection consisting in the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of a thing; the other regards the secondary perfection consisting in operation. Since then carnal intercourse is an operation or use of marriage which gives the faculty for that intercourse, it follows, that carnal intercourse belongs to the latter, and not to the former integrity of marriage [Cf. III, 29, 2 ].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> expressed the integrity of marriage in regard to both perfections, because a thing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by its operation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Signification of the thing contained is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Carnal intercourse belongs not to this signification, but to the thing not contained, as appears from what was said above (1, ad 4,5).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A thing does not reach its end except by its own act. Wherefore, from the fact that the end of <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> is not attained without carnal intercourse, it follows that it belongs to the second and not to the first integrity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Before carnal intercourse marriage is a remedy by virtue of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> given therein, although not by virtue of the act, which belongs to the second integrity.
