<h1>Question 42. Sedition</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3042.htm#article1"> Is it a special sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3042.htm#article2"> Is it a mortal sin?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether sedition is a special sin distinct from other sins?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that sedition is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> distinct from other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For, according to <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> (Etym. x), "a seditious <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is one who sows dissent among minds, and begets discord." Now, by provoking the commission of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by no other kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than that which he provoked. Therefore it seems that sedition is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> distinct from discord.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, sedition denotes a kind of division. Now <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> takes its name from scission, as stated above (Question 39, Article 1). Therefore, seemingly, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of sedition is not distinct from that of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that is distinct from other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, is either a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, or arises from some capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. Now sedition is reckoned neither among the capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, nor among those <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> which arise from them, as appears from Moral. xxxi, 45, where both kinds of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> are enumerated. Therefore sedition is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, distinct from other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Seditions are mentioned as distinct from other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> (<a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse20">2 Corinthians 12:20</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Sedition is a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, having something in common with <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and strife, and differing somewhat from them. It has something in common with them, in so far as it implies a certain antagonism, and it differs from them in two points. First, because <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and strife denote actual aggression on either side, whereas sedition may be said to denote either actual aggression, or the preparation for such aggression. Hence a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse20">2 Corinthians 12:20</a> says that "seditions are tumults tending to fight," when, to wit, a number of people make preparations with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of fighting. Secondly, they differ in that <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> is, properly speaking, carried on against external foes, being as it were between one people and another, whereas strife is between one <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> and another, or between few people on one side and few on the other side, while sedition, in its proper sense, is between mutually dissentient parts of one people, as when one part of the state rises in tumult against another part. Wherefore, since sedition is opposed to a special kind of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, namely the unity and peace of a people, it is a special kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A seditious <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is one who incites others to sedition, and since sedition denotes a kind of discord, it follows that a seditious <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is one who creates discord, not of any kind, but between the parts of a multitude. And the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of sedition is not only in him who sows discord, but also in those who dissent from one another inordinately.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Sedition differs from <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> in two respects. First, because <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> is opposed to the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> unity of the multitude, viz. <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">ecclesiastical unity</a>, whereas sedition is contrary to the temporal or secular unity of the multitude, for instance of a city or kingdom. Secondly, <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> does not imply any preparation for a material fight as sedition does, but only for a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> dissent.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Sedition, like <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, is contained under discord, since each is a kind of discord, not between <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, but between the parts of a multitude.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether sedition is always a mortal sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that sedition is not always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For sedition denotes "a tumult tending to fight," according to the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> quoted above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). But fighting is not always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, indeed it is sometimes just and lawful, as stated above (Question 40, Article 1). Much more, therefore, can sedition be without a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, sedition is a kind of discord, as stated above (1, ad 3). Now discord can be without mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and sometimes without any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> at all. Therefore sedition can be also.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is praiseworthy to deliver a multitude from a tyrannical rule. Yet this cannot easily be done without some dissension in the multitude, if one part of the multitude seeks to retain the tyrant, while the rest strive to dethrone him. Therefore there can be sedition without mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> forbids seditions together with other things that are mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> (<a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse20">2 Corinthians 12:20</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1, ad 2), sedition is contrary to the unity of the multitude, viz. the people of a city or kingdom. Now <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei ii, 21) that "wise men understand the word people to designate not any crowd of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, but the assembly of those who are united together in fellowship recognized by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and for the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." Wherefore it is evident that the unity to which sedition is opposed is the unity of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: whence it follows manifestly that sedition is opposed to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore by reason of its genus it is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and its gravity will be all the greater according as the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which it assails surpasses the private <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is assailed by strife.

<p>Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of sedition is first and chiefly in its authors, who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> most grievously; and secondly it is in those who are led by them to disturb the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Those, however, who defend the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and withstand the seditious party, are not themselves seditious, even as neither is a man to be called quarrelsome because he defends himself, as stated above (Question 41, Article 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is lawful to fight, provided it be for the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as stated above (Question 40, Article 1). But sedition runs counter to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the multitude, so that it is always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Discord from what is not evidently <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, may be without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but discord from what is evidently <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, cannot be without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and sedition is discord of this kind, for it is contrary to the unity of the multitude, which is a manifest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A tyrannical government is not <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, because it is directed, not to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but to the private <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the ruler, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Polit. iii, 5; Ethic. viii, 10). Consequently there is no sedition in disturbing a government of this kind, unless indeed the tyrant's rule be disturbed so inordinately, that his subjects suffer greater harm from the consequent disturbance than from the tyrant's government. Ondeed it is the tyrant rather that is guilty of sedition, since he encourages discord and sedition among his subjects, that he may lord over them more securely; for this is tyranny, being conducive to the private <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the ruler, and to the injury of the multitude.
