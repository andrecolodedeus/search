<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the object of fear is good or evil?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is the object of fear. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. 83, qu. 83) that "we fear nothing save to lose what we love and possess, or not to obtain that which we hope for." But that which we love is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore fear regards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as its proper object.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 5) that "power and to be above another is a thing to be feared." But this is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thing. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is the object of fear.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, there can be no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But we are commanded to fear <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa033.htm#verse10">Psalm 33:10</a>: "Fear the Lord, all ye <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>." Therefore even the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is an object of fear.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 12) that fear is of future <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Fear is a movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power. Now it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power to pursue and to avoid, as stated in Ethic. vi, 2: and pursuit is of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, while avoidance is of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Consequently whatever movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power implies pursuit, has some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for its object: and whatever movement implies avoidance, has an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for its object. Wherefore, since fear implies an avoidance, in the first place and of its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> it regards <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as its proper object.

<p>It can, however, regard <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> also, in so far as referable to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. This can be in two ways. In one way, inasmuch as an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> privation of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now a thing is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> from the very fact that it is a privation of some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Wherefore, since <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is shunned because it is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, it follows that it is shunned because it deprives one of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that one pursues through love thereof. And in this sense <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says that there is no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for fear, save loss of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> we love.

<p>In another way, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> stands related to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: in so far as some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> can by its power bring harm to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> we love: and so, just as hope, as stated above (Question 40, Article 7), regards two things, namely, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to which it tends, and the thing through which there is a hope of obtaining the desired <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; so also does fear regard two things, namely, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> from which it shrinks, and that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which, by its power, can inflict that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. In this way <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is feared by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, inasmuch as He can inflict punishment, <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> or corporal. In this way, too, we fear the power of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; especially when it has been thwarted, or when it is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, because then it is more likely to do us a harm.

<p>In like manner one <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> "to be over another," i.e. to lean on another, so that it is in his power to do us a harm: thus a man <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> another, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> him to be guilty of a crime lest he reveal it to others.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether evil of nature is an object of fear?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not an object of fear. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 5) that "fear makes us take counsel." But we do not take counsel about things which happen <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, as stated in Ethic. iii, 3. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not an object of fear.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> defects such as death and the like are always threatening <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. If therefore such like <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> were an object of fear, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would needs be always in fear.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> does not move to contraries. But <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is an effect of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore if a man shrinks from such like <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> through fear thereof, this is not an effect of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> fear is not of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and yet it seems that it should be.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 6) that "the most terrible of all things is death," which is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 5), fear is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the "<a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> of a future <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which is either corruptive or painful." Now just as a painful <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is that which is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, so a corruptive <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is that which is contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: and this is the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Consequently <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> can be the object of fear.

<p>But it must be observed that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> sometimes arises from a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; and then it is called <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, not merely from being a privation of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but also from being an effect of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; such are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> death and other like defects. But sometimes <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> arises from a non-<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; such as <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> death inflicted by an assailant. In either case <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is feared to a certain extent, and to a certain extent not. For since fear arises "from the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> of future <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 5), whatever removes the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> of the future <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, removes fear also. Now it may happen in two ways that an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> may not appear as about to be. First, through being remote and far off: for, on account of the distance, such a thing is considered as though it were not to be. Hence we either do not fear it, or fear it but little; for, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 5), "we do not fear things that are very far off; since all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they shall die, but as death is not near, they heed it not." Secondly, a future <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is considered as though it were not to be, on account of its being inevitable, wherefore we look upon it as already present. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 5) that "those who are already on the scaffold, are not afraid," seeing that they are on the very point of a death from which there is no escape; "but in order that a man be afraid, there must be some hope of escape for him."

<p>Consequently <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not feared if it be not apprehended as future: but if <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, that is corruptive, be apprehended as near at hand, and yet with some hope of escape, then it will be feared.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> sometimes is not an effect of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as stated above. But in so far as it is an effect of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, although it may be impossible to avoid it entirely, yet it may be possible to delay it. And with this hope one may take counsel about avoiding it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> ever threatens, yet it does not always threaten from near at hand: and consequently it is not always feared.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Death and other defects of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> are the effects of the common <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and yet the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> rebels against them as far as it can. Accordingly, from the inclination of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> arise pain and sorrow for such like <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, when present; fear when threatening in the future.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the evil of sin is an object of fear?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be an object of fear. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says on the canonical Epistle of John (Tract. ix), that "by chaste fear <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> to be severed from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Now nothing but <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> severs us from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; according to <a href="../bible/isa059.htm#verse2">Isaiah 59:2</a>: "Your iniquities have divided between you and your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be an object of fear.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, Cicero says (Quaest. Tusc. iv, 4,6) that "we fear when they are yet to come, those things which give us pain when they are present." But it is possible for one to be pained or sorrowful on account of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore one can also fear the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, hope is contrary to fear. But the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> can be the object of hope, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> declares (Ethic. ix, 4): and the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse10">Galatians 5:10</a>): "I have confidence in you in the Lord, that you will not be of another mind." Therefore fear can regard <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, shame is a kind of fear, as stated above (Question 41, Article 4). But shame regards a disgraceful <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, which is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore fear does so likewise.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 5) that "not all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> are feared, for instance that someone be <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> or slow."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (40, 1; 41, 2), as the object of hope is a future <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> difficult but possible to obtain, so the object of fear is a future <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, arduous and not to be easily avoided. From this we may gather that whatever is entirely subject to our power and will, is not an object of fear; and that nothing gives rise to fear save what is due to an external <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the proper <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and consequently <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, properly speaking, is not an object of fear.

<p>But since the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will may be inclined to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by an extrinsic <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; if this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> have a strong power of inclination, in that respect a man may fear the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in so far as it arises from that extrinsic <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: as when he <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> to dwell in the company of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, lest he be led by them to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But, properly speaking, a man thus disposed, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> the being led astray rather than the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> considered in its proper <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, i.e. as a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> act; for considered in this light it is not an object of fear to him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Separation from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a punishment resulting from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and every punishment is, in some way, due to an extrinsic <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Sorrow and fear agree in one point, since each regards <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: they differ, however, in two points. First, because sorrow is about present <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, whereas fear is future <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Secondly, because sorrow, being in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty, regards <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> absolutely; wherefore it can be about any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, great or small; whereas fear, being in the irascible part, regards <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> with the addition of a certain arduousness or difficulty; which difficulty ceases in so far as a thing is subject to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Consequently not all things that give us pain when they are present, make us fear when they are yet to come, but only some things, namely, those that are difficult.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Hope is of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that is obtainable. Now one may obtain a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> either of oneself, or through another: and so, hope may be of an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which lies within our own power. On the other hand, fear is of an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that does not lie in our own power: and consequently the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which is feared is always from an extrinsic <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; while the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that is hoped for may be both from an intrinsic and from an extrinsic <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As stated above (41, 4, ad 2,3), shame is not fear of the very act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but of the disgrace or ignominy which arises therefrom, and which is due to an extrinsic <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether fear itself can be feared?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that fear cannot be feared. For whatever is feared, is prevented from being lost, through fear thereof: thus a man who <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> to lose his health, keeps it, through fearing its loss. If therefore a man be afraid of fear, he will keep himself from fear by being afraid: which seems absurd.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, fear is a kind of flight. But nothing flies from itself. Therefore fear cannot be the object of fear.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, fear is about the future. But fear is present to him that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a>. Therefore it cannot be the object of his fear.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can love his own love, and can grieve at his own sorrow. Therefore, in like manner, he can fear his own fear.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), nothing can be an object of fear, save what is due to an extrinsic <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; but not that which ensues from our own will. Now fear partly arises from an extrinsic <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and is partly subject to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. It is due to an extrinsic <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, in so far as it is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> resulting from the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> of an imminent <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. In this sense it is possible for fear to be the object of fear, i.e. a man may fear lest he should be threatened by the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of fearing, through being assailed by some great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. It is subject to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, in so far as the lower <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> obeys reason; wherefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is able to drive fear away. In this sense fear cannot be the object of fear, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. 83, qu. 33). Lest, however, anyone make use of his arguments, in order to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that fear cannot be at all be the object of fear, we must add a solution to the same.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Not every fear is identically the same; there are various <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> according to the various objects of fear. Nothing, then, prevents a man from keeping himself from fearing one thing, by fearing another, so that the fear which he has preserves him from the fear which he has not.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Since fear of an imminent <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not identical with the fear of the fear of imminent <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; it does not follow that a thing flies from itself, or that it is the same flight in both cases.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> On account of the various kinds of fear already alluded to (ad 2) a man's present fear may have a future fear for its object.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether sudden things are especially feared?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that unwonted and sudden things are not especially feared. Because, as hope is about <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, so fear is about <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things. But experience conduces to the increase of hope in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things. Therefore it also adds to fear in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 5) that "those are feared most, not who are quick-tempered, but who are gentle and cunning." Now it is clear that those who are quick-tempered are more subject to sudden emotions. Therefore sudden things are less to be feared.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, we think less about things that happen suddenly. But the more we think about a thing, the more we fear it; hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 8) that "some appear to be courageous through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, but as soon as they discover that the case is different from what they expected, they run away." Therefore sudden things are feared less.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. ii, 6): "Fear is startled at things unwonted and sudden, which endanger things beloved, and takes forethought for their safety."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated about (3; 41, 2), the object of fear is an imminent <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, which can be repelled, but with difficulty. Now this is due to one of two <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>: to the greatness of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, or to the weakness of him that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a>; while unwontedness and suddenness conduce to both of these <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. First, it helps an imminent <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to seem greater. Because all material things, whether <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, the more we consider them, the smaller they seem. Consequently, just as sorrow for a present <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is mitigated in course of time, as Cicero states (De Quaest. Tusc. iii, 30); so, too, fear of a future <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is diminished by thinking about it beforehand. Secondly, unwontedness and suddenness increase the weakness of him that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a>, in so far as they deprive him of the remedies with which he might otherwise provide himself to forestall the coming <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, were it not for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> taking him by surprise.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The object of hope is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that is possible to obtain. Consequently whatever increases a man's power, is of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to increase hope, and, for the same reason, to diminish fear, since fear is about an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which cannot be easily repelled. Since, therefore, experience increases a man's power of action, therefore, as it increases hope, so does it diminish fear.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Those who are quick-tempered do not hide their <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; wherefore the harm they do others is not so sudden, as not to be foreseen. On the other hand, those who are gentle or cunning hide their <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; wherefore the harm which may be impending from them, cannot be foreseen, but takes one by surprise. For this reason the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says that such men are feared more than others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Bodily <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, considered in itself, seems greater at first. The reason for this is that a thing is more obvious when seen in juxtaposition with its contrary. Hence, when a man passes unexpectedly from penury to <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, he thinks more of his <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> on account of his previous <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>: while, on the other hand, the rich <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who suddenly becomes poor, finds <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> all the more disagreeable. For this reason sudden <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is feared more, because it seems more to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. However, it may happen through some <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> that the greatness of some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is hidden; for instance if the foe hides himself in ambush: and then it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> inspires greater fear through being much thought about.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether those things are more feared, for which there is no remedy?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that those things are not more to be feared, for which there is no remedy. Because it is a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of fear, that there be some hope of safety, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). But an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that cannot be remedied leaves no hope of escape. Therefore such things are not feared at all.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, there is no remedy for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of death: since, in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> course of things, there is no return from death to life. And yet death is not the most feared of all things, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 5). Therefore those things are not feared most, for which there is no remedy.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. i, 6) that "a thing which lasts long is no better than that which lasts but one day: nor is that which lasts for ever any better than that which is not everlasting": and the same applies to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But things that cannot be remedied seem to differ from other things, merely in the point of their lasting long or for ever. Consequently they are not therefore any worse or more to be feared.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 5) that "those things are most to be feared which when done wrong cannot be put right . . . or for which there is no help, or which are not easy."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The object of fear is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: consequently whatever tends to increase <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, conduces to the increase of fear. Now <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is increased not only in its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but also in respect of circumstances, as stated above (Question 18, Article 3). And of all the circumstances, longlastingness, or even everlastingness, seems to have the greatest bearing on the increase of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Because things that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> are measured, in a way, according to the duration of time: wherefore if it be an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to suffer something for a certain length of time, we should reckon the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> doubled, if it be suffered for twice that length of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. And accordingly, to suffer the same thing for an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> length of time, i.e. for ever, implies, so to speak, an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> increase. Now those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which, after they have come, cannot be remedied at all, or at least not easily, are considered as lasting for ever or for a long time: for which reason they inspire the greatest fear.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Remedy for an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is twofold. One, by which a future <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is warded off from coming. If such a remedy be removed, there is an end to hope and consequently to fear; wherefore we do not speak now of remedies of that kind. The other remedy is one by which an already present <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is removed: and of such a remedy we speak now.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although death be an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> without remedy, yet, since it threatens not from near, it is not feared, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> is speaking there of things that are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in themselves, i.e. <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> specifically. And such like <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is no better for lasting long or for ever: its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> depends on its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.
