<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether scandal is fittingly defined as being something less rightly said or done that occasions spiritual downfall?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is unfittingly defined as "something less rightly said or done that occasions <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> downfall." For <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as we shall state further on (2). Now, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Contra Faust. xxii, 27), a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a "word, <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, or desire contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore the definition given above is insufficient, since it omits "thought" or "desire."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, since among <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> or right acts one is more <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> or more right than another, that one alone which has perfect rectitude would not seem to be a "less" right one. If, therefore, <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is something "less" rightly said or done, it follows that every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> act except the best of all, is a <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, an occasion is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But nothing <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> should enter a definition, because it does not specify the thing defined. Therefore it is unfitting, in defining <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, to say that it is an "occasion."

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, whatever a man does may be the occasion of another's <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> downfall, because <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> are indeterminate. Consequently, if <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is something that occasions another's <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> downfall, any <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> or word can be a <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>: and this seems unreasonable.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, a man occasions his neighbor's <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> downfall when he offends or weakens him. Now <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is condivided with offense and weakness, for the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse21">Romans 14:21</a>): "It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> not to eat flesh, and not to drink wine, nor anything whereby thy brother is offended or <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a>, or weakened." Therefore the aforesaid definition of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is unfitting.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> in expounding <a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse12">Matthew 15:12</a>, "Dost thou <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, when they heard this word," etc. says: "When we read 'Whosoever shall <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalize</a>,' the sense is 'Whosoever shall, by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> or word, occasion another's <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> downfall.'"

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> observes the Greek <em>skandalon</em> may be rendered offense, downfall, or a stumbling against something. For when a body, while moving along a path, meets with an obstacle, it may happen to stumble against it, and be disposed to fall down: such an obstacle is a <em>skandalon</em>.

<p>In like manner, while going along the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> way, a man may be disposed to a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> downfall by another's word or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, in so far, to wit, as one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by his injunction, inducement or example, moves another to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and this is <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> properly so called.

<p>Now nothing by its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> disposes a man to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> downfall, except that which has some lack of rectitude, since what is perfectly right, secures <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> against a fall, instead of conducing to his downfall. Scandal is, therefore, fittingly defined as "something less rightly done or said, that occasions another's <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> downfall."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The thought or desire of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> lies hidden in the heart, wherefore it does not suggest itself to another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as an obstacle conducing to his <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> downfall: hence it cannot come under the head of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A thing is said to be less right, not because something else surpasses it in rectitude, but because it has some lack of rectitude, either through being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in itself, such as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or through having an appearance of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Thus, for instance, if a man were to "sit at meat in the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idol's</a> temple" (<a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse10">1 Corinthians 8:10</a>), though this is not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> in itself, provided it be done with no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, yet, since it has a certain appearance of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and a semblance of worshipping the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idol</a>, it might occasion another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> downfall. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1th005.htm#verse22">1 Thessalonians 5:22</a>): "From all appearance of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> refrain yourselves." Scandal is therefore fittingly described as something done "less rightly," so as to comprise both whatever is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> in itself, and all that has an appearance of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (I-II, 75, 2,3; I-II, 80, 1), nothing can be a sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a man's <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> downfall, which is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, save his own will. Wherefore another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> words or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> can only be an imperfect <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, conducing somewhat to that downfall. For this reason <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is said to afford not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but an occasion, which is an imperfect, and not always an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Nor is there any reason why certain definitions should not make mention of things that are <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>, since what is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to one, may be proper to something else: thus the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is mentioned in the definition of chance (Phys. ii, 5).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Another's words or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> may be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of another's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in two ways, directly and <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>. Directly, when a man either intends, by his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> word or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, to lead another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or, if he does not so intend, when his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> is of such a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as to lead another into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: for instance, when a man publicly commits a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> or does something that has an appearance of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. On this case he that does such an act does, properly speaking, afford an occasion of another's <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> downfall, wherefore his act is called "active <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>." One <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> word or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> is the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of another's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, when he neither intends to lead him into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, nor does what is of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to lead him into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and yet this other one, through being ill-disposed, is led into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for instance, into <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> of another's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and then he who does this righteous act, does not, so far as he is concerned, afford an occasion of the other's downfall, but it is this other one who takes the occasion according to <a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse8">Romans 7:8</a>: "Sin taking occasion by the commandment wrought in me all manner of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>." Wherefore this is "passive," without "active <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>," since he that acts rightly does not, for his own part, afford the occasion of the other's downfall. Sometimes therefore it happens that there is active <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> in the one together with passive <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> in the other, as when one commits a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> being induced thereto by another; sometimes there is active without passive <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, for instance when one, by word or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, provokes another to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and the latter does not consent; and sometimes there is passive without active <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, as we have already said.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> "Weakness" denotes proneness to <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>; while "offense" signifies resentment against the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who commits a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which resentment may be sometimes without <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> downfall; and "<a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>" is the stumbling that results in downfall.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether scandal is a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> do not occur from <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, since all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, as stated above (I-II, 74, A1,2). Now it is written (<a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse7">Matthew 18:7</a>): "It must needs be that <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandals</a> come." Therefore <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> arises from a sense of dutifulness, because "a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> tree cannot bring forth <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> fruit" (<a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse18">Matthew 7:18</a>). But <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> may come from a sense of dutifulness, for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse23">Matthew 16:23</a>): "Thou art a <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> unto Me," in reference to which words <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says that "the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle's</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> was due to his sense of dutifulness, and such is never inspired by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is not always a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> denotes a stumbling. But he that stumbles does not always fall. Therefore <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, which is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> fall, can be without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Scandal is "something less rightly said or done." Now anything that lacks rectitude is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is always with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As already said (1, ad 4), <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is of two kinds, passive <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a>, and active <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who gives <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, and so occasions a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> downfall. Accordingly passive <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is always a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a>; for he is not scandalized except in so far as he succumbs to a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> downfall, and that is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>Yet there can be passive <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> on the part of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> whose action has occasioned the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, as for instance, when a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is scandalized at another's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>. On like manner active <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is always a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who gives <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, since either what he does is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or if it only have the appearance of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it should always be left undone out of that love for our neighbor which binds each one to be solicitous for his neighbor's <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> welfare; so that if he persist in doing it he acts against <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p>Yet there can be active <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> on the part of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a>, as stated above (1, ad 4).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> These words, "It must needs be that <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandals</a> come," are to be understood to convey, not the absolute, but the conditional <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>; in which sense it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that whatever <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> foresees or foretells must happen, provided it be taken conjointly with such foreknowledge, as explained in I, 14, 13, ad 3; I, 23, 6, ad 2.

<p>Or we may say that the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandals</a> occurring is a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of end, because they are useful in order that "they . . . who are reproved may be made manifest" (<a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse19">1 Corinthians 11:19</a>).

<p>Or <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandals</a> must needs occur, seeing the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who fails to shield himself from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Thus a physician on seeing a man partaking of unsuitable food might say that such a man must needs injure his health, which is to be understood on the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> that he does not change his diet. On like manner it must needs be that <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandals</a> come, so long as men fail to change their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> mode of living.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In that passage <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> denotes any kind of hindrance: for <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> wished to hinder <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> out of a sense of dutifulness towards <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> stumbles spiritually, without being kept back somewhat from advancing in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> way, and that is at least a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is "something said or done less rightly." But this applies to every kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, and consequently, <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every special kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or every special kind of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, may be found separately from other kinds, as stated in Ethic. v, 3,5. But <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is not to be found separately from other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore it is not a special kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is constituted by something which specifies the moral act. But the notion of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> consists in its being something done in the presence of others: and the fact of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> being committed openly, though it is an aggravating circumstance, does not seem to constitute the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> has a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> opposed to it. But <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is opposed to a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, viz. <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse15">Romans 14:15</a>): "If, because of thy meat, thy brother be grieved, thou walkest not now according to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is twofold, active and passive. Passive <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> cannot be a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because through another's word or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> a man may fall into any kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and the fact that a man takes occasion to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from another's word or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, does not constitute a special kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because it does not imply a special deformity in opposition to a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p>On the other hand, active <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> may be understood in two ways, directly and accidently. The <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> when it is beside the agent's <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, as when a man does not intend, by his inordinate <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> or word, to occasion another's <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> downfall, but merely to satisfy his own will. On such a case even active <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is not constituted by that which is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>.

<p>Active <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is direct when a man intends, by his inordinate word or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, to draw another into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and then it becomes a special kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> on account of the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of a special kind of end, because moral actions take their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from their end, as stated above (I-II, 1, 3; I-II, 18, 4,6). Hence, just as <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> are special kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, on account of their denoting the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of doing a special injury to one's neighbor: so too, <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is a special kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because thereby a man intends a special harm to his neighbor, and it is directly opposed to <a href="../cathen/04394a.htm">fraternal correction</a>, whereby a man intends the removal of a special kind of harm.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may be the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of active <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, but it may derive the formal aspect of a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from the end intended, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Active <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> can be found separate from other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as when a man scandalizes his neighbor by a <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> which is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in itself, but has an appearance of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Scandal does not derive the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from the circumstance in question, but from the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the end, as stated above.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether scandal is a mortal sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that is contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated above (24, 12; 35, 3). But <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as stated above (A2,3). Therefore <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, save mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, deserves the punishment of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal damnation</a>. But <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> deserves the punishment of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal damnation</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse6">Matthew 18:6</a>: "He that shall <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalize</a> one of these little ones, that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Me, it were better for him that a mill-stone should be hanged about his neck, and that he should be drowned in the depth of the sea." For, as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on this passage, "it is much better to receive a brief punishment for a fault, than to await everlasting torments." Therefore <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> alone turns <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 8:12</a>): "When you wound the weak <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> of the brethren [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'When you <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> thus against the brethren and wound their weak <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>'], you <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It may be a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to lead a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> into venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and yet this would be to give <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> may be a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> denotes a stumbling whereby a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is disposed to a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> downfall. Consequently passive <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> may sometimes be a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, when it consists in a stumbling and nothing more; for instance, when a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is disturbed by a movement of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> occasioned by another's inordinate word or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>: while sometimes it is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, when the stumbling results in a downfall, for instance, when a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> goes so far as to commit a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through another's inordinate word or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>.

<p>Active <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, if it be <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>, may sometimes be a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for instance, when, through a slight indiscretion, a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> either commits a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or does something that is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in itself, but has some appearance of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. On the other hand, it is sometimes a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, either because a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> commits a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or because he has such contempt for his neighbor's <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> welfare that he declines, for the sake of procuring it, to forego doing what he wishes to do. But in the case of active direct <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, as when a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> intends to lead another into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, if he intends to lead him into mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> will be mortal; and in like manner if he intends by committing a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> himself, to lead another into venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; whereas if he intends, by committing a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, to lead another into venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, there will be a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>.

<p>And this suffices for the Replies to the Objections.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether passive scandal may happen even to the perfect?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that passive <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> may happen even to the perfect. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was supremely perfect: and yet He said to <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse23">Matthew 16:23</a>): "Thou art a <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> to Me." Much more therefore can other perfect men suffer <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> denotes an obstacle which is put in a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> way. Now even perfect men can be hindered in their progress along the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> way, according to <a href="../bible/1th002.htm#verse18">1 Thessalonians 2:18</a>: "We would have come to you, I <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> indeed, once and again; but Satan hath hindered us." Therefore even perfect men can suffer <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, even perfect men are liable to venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#verse8">1 John 1:8</a>: "If we say that we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we deceive ourselves." Now passive <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is not always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but is sometimes venial, as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>). Therefore passive <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> may be found in perfect men.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, in <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse6">Matthew 18:6</a>, "He that shall <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalize</a> one of these little ones," says: "Observe that it is the little one that is <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a>, for the elders do not take <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Passive <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> implies that the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who takes <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is unsettled in its adherence to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can be unsettled, who adheres firmly to something immovable. The elders, i.e. the perfect, adhere to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, Whose <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is unchangeable, for though they adhere to their superiors, they do so only in so far as these adhere to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse16">1 Corinthians 4:16</a>: "Be ye followers of me, as I also am of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." Wherefore, however much others may appear to them to conduct themselves ill in word or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, they themselves do not stray from their righteousness, according to <a href="../bible/psa124.htm#verse1">Psalm 124:1</a>: "They that trust in the Lord shall be as Mount Sion: he shall not be moved for ever that dwelleth in Jerusalem." Therefore <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is not found in those who adhere to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> perfectly by love, according to <a href="../bible/psa118.htm#verse165">Psalm 118:165</a>: "Much peace have they that love Thy <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and to them there is no stumbling-block [scandalum]."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (2, ad 2), in this passage, <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is used in a broad sense, to denote any kind of hindrance. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>: "Thou art a <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> to Me," because he was endeavoring to weaken <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> purpose of undergoing His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Perfect men may be hindered in the performance of external actions. But they are not hindered by the words or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of others, from tending to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the internal acts of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse38">Romans 8:38-39</a>: "Neither death, nor life . . . shall be able to separate us from the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Perfect men sometimes fall into venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through the weakness of the flesh; but they are not scandalized (taking <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> in its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sense), by the words or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of others, although there can be an approach to <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> in them, according to <a href="../bible/psa072.htm#verse2">Psalm 72:2</a>: "My feet were almost moved."

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether active scandal can be found in the perfect?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that active <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> can be found in the perfect. For passion is the effect of action. Now some are scandalized passively by the words or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the perfect, according to <a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse12">Matthew 15:12</a>: "Dost thou <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, when they heard this word, were <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a>?" Therefore active <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> can be found in the perfect.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, after receiving the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, was in the state of the perfect. Yet afterwards he scandalized the gentiles: for it is written (<a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse14">Galatians 2:14</a>): "When I saw that they walked not uprightly unto the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the Gospel, I said to <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Cephas</a>," i.e. Peter, "before them all: If thou being a <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jew</a>, livest after the manner of the gentiles, and not as the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> do, how dost thou compel the gentiles to live as do the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>?" Therefore active <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> can be in the perfect.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, active <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is sometimes a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> may be in perfect men. Therefore active <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> may be in perfect men.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Active <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is more opposed to perfection, than passive <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>. But passive <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> cannot be in the perfect. Much less, therefore, can active <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> be in them.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Active <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, properly so called, occurs when a man says or does a thing which in itself is of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to occasion another's <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> downfall, and that is only when what he says or does is inordinate. Now it belongs to the perfect to direct all their actions according to the rule of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, as stated in <a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse40">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>: "Let all things be done decently and according to order"; and they are careful to do this in those matters chiefly wherein not only would they do wrong, but would also be to others an occasion of wrongdoing. And if indeed they fail in this moderation in such words or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> as come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of others, this has its origin in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness wherein they fall short of perfection. Yet they do not fall short so far as to stray far from the order of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, but only a little and in some slight <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: and this is not so grave that anyone can reasonably take therefrom an occasion for committing <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Passive <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is always due to some active <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>; yet this active <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is not always in another, but in the very <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who is <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a>, because, to wit, he scandalizes himself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In the opinion of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Ep. xxviii, xl, lxxxii) and of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also, <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> and was to be blamed, in withdrawing from the gentiles in order to avoid the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, because he did this somewhat imprudently, so that the gentiles who had been converted to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> were scandalized. Nevertheless <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter's</a> action was not so grave a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as to give others sufficient ground for <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>. Hence they were guilty of passive <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, while there was no active <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> in <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the perfect consist chiefly in sudden movements, which being hidden cannot give <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>. If, however, they commit any venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> even in their external words or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, these are so slight as to be insufficient in themselves to give <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether spiritual goods should be foregone on account of scandal?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods ought to be foregone on account of scandal. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Contra Ep. Parmen. iii, 2) teaches that "punishment for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> should cease, when the peril of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> is feared." But punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since it is an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is to be foregone on account of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the Sacred Doctrine is a most <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> thing. Yet one ought to desist therefrom on account of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse6">Matthew 7:6</a>: "Give not that which is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> to dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine lest . . . turning upon you, they tear you." Therefore a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> should be foregone on account of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, since fraternal correction is an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, it is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Yet sometimes it is omitted out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, in order to avoid giving <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> to others, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> observes (De Civ. Dei i, 9). Therefore a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> should be foregone on account of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> [<a href="../cathen/07521b.htm">Hugh de S. Cher</a>, In Matth. xviii; in Luc. xvii, 2 says that in order to avoid <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> we should forego whatever it is possible to omit without prejudice to the threefold <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, i.e. "the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of life, of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and of doctrine." Now the observance of the counsels, and the bestowal of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> may often be omitted without prejudice to the aforesaid threefold <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, else whoever omitted them would always be guilty of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and yet such things are the greatest of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> works. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> works should be omitted on account of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the avoidance of any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> brings <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> harm to the sinner. Now it seems that one ought sometimes to commit a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in order to avoid scandalizing one's neighbor, for instance, when by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> venially, one would prevent someone else from committing a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: because one is bound to hinder the damnation of one's neighbor as much as one can without prejudice to one's own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, which is not precluded by a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore one ought to forego a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in order to avoid <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. Super Ezech. vii): "If people are scandalized at the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, it is better to allow the birth of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, than to abandon the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods belong, above all others, to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods are not to be foregone on account of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Whereas <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is twofold, active and passive, the present question does not apply to active <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, for since active <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is "something said or done less rightly," nothing ought to be done that implies active <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>. The question does, however, apply to passive <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, and accordingly we have to see what ought to be foregone in order to avoid <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>. Now a distinction must be made in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods. For some of them are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and cannot be foregone without mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and it is evident that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ought to commit a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in order to prevent another from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, because according to the order of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, a man ought to love his own <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> welfare more than another's. Therefore one ought not to forego that which is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, in order to avoid giving <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>.

<p>Again a distinction seems <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> among <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things which are not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: because the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> which arises from such things sometimes proceeds from <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, for instance when a man wishes to hinder those <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods by stirring up <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>. This is the "scandal of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>," who were scandalized at <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> teaching: and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> teaches (<a href="../bible/mat015.htm">Matthew 15:14</a>) that we ought to treat such like <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> with contempt. Sometimes <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> proceeds from weakness or <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and such is the "scandal of little ones." On order to avoid this kind of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods ought to be either concealed, or sometimes even deferred (if this can be done without incurring immediate danger), until the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> being explained the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> cease. If, however, the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> continue after the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> has been explained, it would seem to be due to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, and then it would no longer be right to forego that <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in order to avoid such like <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In the infliction of punishment it is not the punishment itself that is the end in view, but its medicinal properties in checking <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; wherefore punishment partakes of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, in so far as it checks <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But if it is evident that the infliction of punishment will result in more numerous and more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> being committed, the infliction of punishment will no longer be a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. It is in this sense that <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is speaking, when, to wit, the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> of a few threatens to bring about the danger of a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, for in that case it would be contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to pronounce <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> With regard to a man's doctrine two points must be considered, namely, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which is taught, and the act of teaching. The first of these is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, to wit, that he whose <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> it is to teach should no' teach what is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and that he should teach the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> according to the requirements of times and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>: wherefore on no account ought he to suppress the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and teach <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in order to avoid any <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> that might ensue. But the act itself of teaching is one of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsdeeds</a>, as stated above (Question 32, Article 2), and so the same is to be said of it as of the other <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">works of mercy</a>, of which we shall speak further on (ad 4).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (Question 33, Article 1), fraternal correction aims at the correction of a brother, wherefore it is to be reckoned among <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods in so far as this end can be obtained, which is not the case if the brother be scandalized through being corrected. And so, if the correction be omitted in order to avoid <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, no <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is foregone.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of life, of doctrine, and of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> comprises not only whatever is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, but also whatever is a means of obtaining <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> more perfectly, according to <a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse31">1 Corinthians 12:31</a>: "Be zealous for the better <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>." Wherefore neither the counsels nor even the <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">works of mercy</a> are to be altogether omitted in order to avoid <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>; but sometimes they should be concealed or deferred, on account of the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> of the little ones, as stated above. Sometimes, however, the observance of the counsels and the fulfilment of the <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">works of mercy</a> are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. This may be seen in the case of those who have vowed to keep the counsels, and of those whose <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> it is to relieve the wants of others, either in temporal matters (as by feeding the hungry), or in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> matters (as by instructing the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>), whether such duties arise from their being enjoined as in the case of <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, or from the need on the part of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in want; and then the same applies to these things as to others that are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Some have said that one ought to commit a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in order to avoid <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>. But this implies a contradiction, since if it ought to be done, it is no longer <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> or <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, for a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot be a matter of choice. It may happen however that, on account of some circumstance, something is not a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, though it would be were it not for that circumstance: thus an idle word is a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, when it is uttered uselessly; yet if it be uttered for a reasonable <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, it is neither idle nor <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. And though venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not deprive a man of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which is his means of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, yet, in so far as it disposes him to mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it tends to the loss of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether temporal goods should be foregone on account of scandal?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that temporal goods should be foregone on account of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>. For we ought to love our neighbor's <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> welfare which is hindered by <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, more than any temporal goods whatever. But we forego what we love less for the sake of what we love more. Therefore we should forego temporal goods in order to avoid scandalizing our neighbor.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome's</a> rule [Cf. 7, Objection 4], whatever can be foregone without prejudice to the threefold <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, should be omitted in order to avoid <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>. Now temporal goods can be foregone without prejudice to the threefold <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Therefore they should be foregone in order to avoid <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no temporal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is more <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> than food. But we ought to forego taking food on account of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse15">Romans 14:15</a>: "Destroy not him with thy meat for whom <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> died." Much more therefore should all other temporal goods be foregone on account of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the most fitting way of safeguarding and recovering temporal goods is the court of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. But it is unlawful to have recourse to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, especially if <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> ensues: for it is written (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse40">Matthew 5:40</a>): "If a man will contend with thee in judgment, and take away thy coat, let go thy cloak also unto him"; and (<a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse7">1 Corinthians 6:7</a>): "Already indeed there is plainly a fault among you, that you have lawsuits one with another. Why do you not rather take wrong? why do you not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?" Therefore it seems that we ought to forego temporal goods on account of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, we ought, seemingly, to forego least of all those temporal goods which are connected with <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods: and yet we ought to forego them on account of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> while sowing <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things did not accept a temporal stipend lest he "should give any hindrance to the Gospel of Christ" as we read <a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 9:12</a>. For a like reason the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not demand <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> in certain countries, in order to avoid scandal. Much more, therefore, ought we to forego other temporal goods in order to avoid <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Blessed Thomas of Canterbury demanded the restitution of Church property, notwithstanding that the king took <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> from his doing so.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A distinction must be made in temporal goods: for either they are ours, or they are consigned to us to take care of them for someone else; thus the goods of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are consigned to <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, and the goods of the community are entrusted to all such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> as have authority over the common weal. On this latter case the care of such things (as of things held in deposit) devolves of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> on those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to whom they are entrusted, wherefore, even as other things that are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, they are not to be foregone on account of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>. On the other hand, as regards those temporalities of which we have the dominion, sometimes, on account of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, we are bound to forego them, and sometimes we are not so bound, whether we forego them by giving them up, if we have them in our possession, or by omitting to claim them, if they are in the possession of others. For if the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> arise therefrom through the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or weakness of others (in which case, as stated above, 7, it is <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> of the little ones) we must either forego such temporalities altogether, or the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> must be abated by some other means, namely, by some kind of admonition. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 20): "Thou shouldst give so as to injure neither thyself nor another, as much as thou canst lend, and if thou refusest what is asked, thou must yet be just to him, indeed thou wilt give him something better than he asks, if thou reprove him that asks <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>." Sometimes, however, <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> arises from <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>. This is <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>: and we ought not to forego temporal goods for the sake of those who stir up <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandals</a> of this kind, for this would both be harmful to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since it would give <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men an opportunity of plunder, and would be injurious to the plunderers themselves, who would remain in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as long as they were in possession of another's property. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxi, 13): "Sometimes we ought to suffer those who rob us of our temporalities, while sometimes we should resist them, as far as equity allows, in the hope not only that we may safeguard our property, but also lest those who take what is not theirs may lose themselves."

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> If it were permissible for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men to rob other people of their property, this would tend to the detriment of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of life and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Therefore we are not always bound to forego our temporal goods in order to avoid <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> had no <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of counselling total abstinence from food on account of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, because our welfare requires that we should take food: but he intended to counsel abstinence from a particular kind of food, in order to avoid <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse13">1 Corinthians 8:13</a>: "I will never eat flesh, lest I should <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalize</a> my brother."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 19) this precept of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> is to be understood of the preparedness of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, namely, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be prepared, if it be expedient, to suffer being harmed or defrauded, rather than go to <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. But sometimes it is not expedient, as stated above (ad 2). The same applies to the saying of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> which the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> avoided, arose from an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the gentiles who were not used to this payment. Hence it behooved him to forego it for the time being, so that they might be taught first of all that such a payment was a <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. For a like reason the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> refrains from demanding <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> in those countries where it is not customary to pay them.
