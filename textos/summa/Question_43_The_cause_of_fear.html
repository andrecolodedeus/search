<h1>Question 43. The cause of fear</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2043.htm#article1"> Is love the cause of fear?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2043.htm#article2"> Is defect the cause of fear?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether love is the cause of fear?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that love is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of fear. For that which leads to a thing is its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But "fear leads to the love of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>" as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says on the canonical epistle of John (Tract. ix). Therefore fear is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of love, and not conversely.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 5) that "those are feared most from whom we dread the advent of some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." But the dread of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> being <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by someone, makes us <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> rather than love him. Therefore fear is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> rather than by love.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it has been stated above (Question 42, Article 3) that those things which occur by our own doing are not fearful. But that which we do from love, is done from our inmost heart. Therefore fear is not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by love.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. 83, qu. 33): "There can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that there is no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for fear save the loss of what we love, when we possess it, or the failure to obtain what we hope for." Therefore all fear is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> something: and consequently love is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of fear.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The objects of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> stand in relation thereto as the forms to things <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> or artificial: because the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> take their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from their objects, as the aforesaid things do from their forms. Therefore, just as whatever is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the form, is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the thing constituted by that form, so whatever is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, in any way whatever, of the object, is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the passion. Now a thing may be a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the object, either by way of efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, or by way of material disposition. Thus the object of pleasure is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> apprehended as suitable and conjoined: and its efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is that which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the conjunction, or the suitableness, or <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, or apprehension of that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thing; while its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> by way of material disposition, is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> or any sort of disposition by reason of which this conjoined <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> becomes suitable or is apprehended as such.

<p>Accordingly, as to the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in question, the object of fear is something reckoned as an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to come, near at hand and difficult to avoid. Therefore that which can inflict such an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, is the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the object of fear, and, consequently, of fear itself. While that which renders a man so disposed that thing is such an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to him, is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of fear and of its object, by way of material disposition. And thus it is that love <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> fear: since it is through his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> a certain <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, that whatever deprives a man of that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to him, and that consequently he <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> it as an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (Question 42, Article 1), fear, of itself and in the first place, regards the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> from which it recoils as being contrary to some loved <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: and thus fear, of itself, is born of love. But, in the second place, it regards the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> from which that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> ensues: so that sometimes, <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, fear gives rise to love; in so far as, for instance, through fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> punishments, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> keeps His commandments, and thus begins to <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, while hope leads to love, as stated above (Question 40, Article 7).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> He, from whom <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is expected, is indeed <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> at first; but afterwards, when once we begin to hope for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> from him, we begin to love him. But the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, the contrary <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of which is feared, was loved from the beginning.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of that which is the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to be feared: whereas love <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> fear by way of material disposition, as stated above.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether defect is the cause of fear?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that defect is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of fear. Because those who are in power are very much feared. But defect is contrary to power. Therefore defect is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of fear.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the defect of those who are already being executed is extreme. But such like do not fear as stated in Rhet. ii, 5. Therefore defect is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of fear.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, contests arise from strength not from defect. But "those who contend fear those who contend with them" (Rhet. ii, 5). Therefore defect is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of fear.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Contraries ensue from contrary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. But "<a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, strength, a multitude of friends, and power drive fear away" (Rhet. ii, 5). Therefore fear is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by lack of these.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), fear may be set down to a twofold <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: one is by way of a material disposition, on the part of him that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a>; the other is by way of efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, on the part of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> feared. As to the first then, some defect is, of itself, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of fear: for it is owing to some lack of power that one is unable easily to repulse a threatening <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And yet, in order to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> fear, this defect must be according to a measure. For the defect which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> fear of a future <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, is less than the defect <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> present, which is the object of sorrow. And still greater would be the defect, if perception of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, or love of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> whose contrary is feared, were entirely absent.

<p>But as to the second, power and strength are, of themselves, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of fear: because it is owing to the fact that the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> apprehended as harmful is powerful, that its effect cannot be repulsed. It may happen, however, in this respect, that some defect <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> fear <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, in so far as owing to some defect someone wishes to hurt another; for instance, by reason of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, either because that other has already done him a harm, or because he <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> to be harmed by him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of fear, on the part of the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Those who are already being executed, are actually suffering from a present <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; wherefore their defect exceeds the measure of fear.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Those who contend with one another are afraid, not on account of the power which enables them to contend: but on account of the lack of power, owing to which they are not confident of victory.
