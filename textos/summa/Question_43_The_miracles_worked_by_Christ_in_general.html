<h1>Question 43. The miracles worked by Christ, in general</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/4043.htm#article1"> Should Christ have worked miracles?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4043.htm#article2"> Did He work them by Divine power?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4043.htm#article3"> When did He begin to work miracles?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4043.htm#article4"> Are His miracles a sufficient proof of His Godhead?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether Christ should have worked miracles?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should not have worked <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> should have been consistent with His words. But He Himself said (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse4">Matthew 16:4</a>): "A <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulterous</a> generation seeketh after a sign; and a sign shall not be given it, but the sign of <a href="../cathen/08497b.htm">Jonah the prophet</a>." Therefore He should not have worked <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, at His second coming, is to come "with" great power and majesty, as is written <a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse30">Matthew 24:30</a>, so at His first coming He came in infirmity, according to <a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse3">Isaiah 53:3</a>: "A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of sorrows and acquainted with infirmity." But the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> belongs to power rather than to infirmity. Therefore it was not fitting that He should work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in His first coming.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> came that He might save men by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; according to <a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse2">Hebrews 12:2</a>: "Looking on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the author and finisher of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>." But <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> lessen the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> says (<a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse48">John 4:48</a>): "Unless you see signs and wonders you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not." Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should not have worked <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It was said in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of His adversaries (<a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse47">John 11:47</a>): "What do we; for this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> doth many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>?"

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> enables <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> for two reasons. First and principally, in confirmation of the doctrine that a man teaches. For since those things which are of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> surpass <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, they cannot be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> arguments, but need to be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the argument of Divine power: so that when a man does works that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone can do, we may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that what he says is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: just as when a man is the bearer of letters sealed with the king's <a href="../cathen/13059a.htm">ring</a>, it is to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that what they contain expresses the king's will.

<p>Secondly, in order to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> presence in a man by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: so that when a man does the works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> we may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> dwells in him by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse5">Galatians 3:5</a>): "He who giveth to you the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and worketh <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> among you."

<p>Now both these things were to be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> concerning Christ--namely, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> dwelt in Him by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, not of adoption, but of union: and that His <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> doctrine was from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And therefore it was most fitting that He should work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. Wherefore He Himself says (<a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse38">John 10:38</a>): "Though you will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Me, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the works"; and (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse36">John 5:36</a>): "The works which the Father hath given Me to perfect . . . themselves . . . give testimony to Me."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> These words, "a sign shall not be given it, but the sign of <a href="../cathen/08497b.htm">Jonas</a>," mean, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. xliii in Matth.), that "they did not receive a sign such as they sought, viz. from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>": but not that He gave them no sign at all. Or that "He worked signs not for the sake of those whom He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> to be hardened, but to amend others." Therefore those signs were given, not to them, but to others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> came "in the infirmity" of the flesh, which is manifested in the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, yet He came "in the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" [Cf. <a href="../bible/2co013.htm#verse4">2 Corinthians 13:4</a>, and this had to be made manifest by <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Miracles lessen the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in so far as those are shown to be hard of heart who are unwilling to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> unless (they are convinced) by <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. Yet it is better for them to be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> even by <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> than that they should remain altogether in their unbelief. For it is written (<a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse22">1 Corinthians 14:22</a>) that signs are given "to unbelievers," viz. that they may be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether Christ worked miracles by Divine power?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> by Divine power. For the Divine power is <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>. But it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> in working <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>; for it is written (<a href="../bible/mar006.htm#verse5">Mark 6:5</a>) that "He could not do any <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> there," i.e. in His own country. Therefore it seems that He did not work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> by Divine power.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> sometimes <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> when working <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>; as may be seen in the raising of <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a> (<a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse41">John 11:41-42</a>), and in the multiplication of the loaves, as related <a href="../bible/mat014.htm#verse19">Matthew 14:19</a>. Therefore it seems that He did not work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> by Divine power.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, what is done by Divine power cannot be done by the power of any creature. But the things which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did could be done also by the power of a creature: wherefore the Pharisees said (<a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse15">Luke 11:15</a>) that He cast out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">devils</a> "by Beelzebub the prince of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">devils</a>." Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> by Divine power.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse10">John 14:10</a>): "The Father who abideth in Me, He doth the works."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> as stated in I, 110, 4, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> cannot be wrought save by Divine power: because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone can change the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and this is what is meant by a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>. Wherefore Pope Leo says (Ep. ad Flav. xxviii) that, while there are two natures in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, there is "one," viz. the Divine, which shines forth in <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>; and "another," viz. the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, "which submits to insults"; yet "each communicates its actions to the other": in as far as the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is the instrument of the Divine action, and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> action receives power from the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, as stated above (Question 19, Article 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> When it is said that "He could not do any <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> there," it is not to be understood that He could not do them absolutely, but that it was not fitting for Him to do them: for it was unfitting for Him to work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> among unbelievers. Wherefore it is said farther on: "And He wondered because of their unbelief." In like manner it is said (<a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse17">Genesis 18:17</a>): "Can I hide from <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> what I am about to do?" and <a href="../bible/gen019.htm#verse22">Genesis 19:22</a>: "I cannot do anything till thou go in thither."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says on <a href="../bible/mat014.htm#verse19">Matthew 14:19</a>, "He took the five loaves and the two fishes, and, looking up to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, He blessed and brake: It was to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> of Him, both that He is of the Father and that He is equal to Him . . . Therefore that He might <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> both, He works <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> now with authority, now with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> . . . in the lesser things, indeed, He looks up to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>"--for instance, in multiplying the loaves--"but in the greater, which belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, He acts with authority; for example, when He forgave <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and raised the dead."

<p>When it is said that in raising <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a> He lifted up His eyes (<a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse41">John 11:41</a>), this was not because He needed to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, but because He wished to teach us how to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. Wherefore He said: "Because of the people who stand about have I said it: that they may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that Thou hast sent Me."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> cast out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> otherwise than they are cast out by the power of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. For <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are cast out from bodies by the power of higher <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> in such a way that they retain their power over the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: since the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> does not work against his own kingdom. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> cast out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, not only from the body, but still more from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For this reason <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> rebuked the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, who said that He cast out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> by the power of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>: first, by saying that Satan is not divided against himself; secondly, by quoting the instance of others who cast out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>; thirdly, because He could not have cast out a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> unless He had overcome Him by Divine power; fourthly, because there was nothing in common between His works and their effects and those of Satan; since Satan's purpose was to "scatter" those whom <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> "gathered" together [Cf. <a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse24">Matthew 12:24-30</a>; <a href="../bible/mar003.htm#verse22">Mark 3:22</a>; <a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse15">Luke 11:15-32</a>].

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether Christ began to work miracles when He changed water into wine at the marriage feast?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not begin to work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> when He changed water into wine at the marriage feast. For we read in the book De Infantia Salvatoris that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> worked many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in His childhood. But the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of changing water into wine at the marriage feast took place in the thirtieth or thirty-first year of His age. Therefore it seems that it was not then that He began to work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> worked <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> by Divine power. Now He was possessed of Divine power from the first moment of His conception; for from that instant He was both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore it seems that He worked <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> from the very first.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> began to gather His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> after His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, as related <a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse18">Matthew 4:18</a> and <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse35">John 1:35</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> gathered around Him, principally on account of His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>: thus it is written (<a href="../bible/luk005.htm#verse4">Luke 5:4</a>) that He called Peter when "he was astonished at" the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> which He had worked in "the draught of fishes." Therefore it seems that He worked other <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> before that of the marriage feast.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/joh002.htm#verse11">John 2:11</a>): "This beginning of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> did <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> in Cana of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> worked <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in order to confirm His doctrine, and in order to show forth His Divine power. Therefore, as to the first, it was unbecoming for Him to work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> before He began to teach. And it was unfitting that He should begin to teach until He reached the perfect age, as we stated above, in speaking of His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> (39,3). But as to the second, it was right that He should so manifest His Godhead by working <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> that men should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the reality of His manhood. And, consequently, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. xxi in Joan.), "it was fitting that He should not begin to work wonders from His early years: for men would have deemed <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> to be <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> and would have crucified Him before the proper time."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. xvii in Joan.), in regard to the saying of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a>, "'That He may be made manifest in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, therefore am I come <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> with water,' it is clear that the wonders which some pretend to have been worked by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in His childhood are <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a> and fictitious. For had <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> worked <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> from His early years, John would by no means have been unacquainted with Him, nor would the rest of the people have stood in need of a teacher to point Him out to them."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> What the Divine power achieved in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was in proportion to the needs of the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, the achievement of which was the purpose of His taking flesh. Consequently He so worked <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> by the Divine power as not to prejudice our <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the reality of His flesh.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were to be commended precisely because they followed <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> "without having seen Him work any <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>," as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says in a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> (Hom. v in Evang.). And, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. xxiii in Joan.), "the need for working <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> arose then, especially when the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were already gathered around and attached to Him, and attentive to what was going on around them. Hence it is added: 'And His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Him,'" not because they then <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Him for the first time, but because then "they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> with greater discernment and perfection." Or they are called "<a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>" because "they were to be <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> later on," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> observes (De Consensu Evang. ii).

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the miracles which Christ worked were a sufficient proof of His Godhead?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> worked were not a sufficient <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of His Godhead. For it is proper to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> worked have been done by others also. Therefore they were not a sufficient <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of His Godhead.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no power surpasses that of the Godhead. But some have worked greater <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> than <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, for it is written (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse12">John 14:12</a>): "He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> in Me, the works that I do, he also shall do, and greater than these shall he do." Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> worked are not sufficient <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of His Godhead.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the particular is not a sufficient <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the universal. But any one of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> was one particular work. Therefore none of them was a sufficient <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of His Godhead, by reason of which He had universal power over all things.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse36">John 5:36</a>): "The works which the Father hath given Me to perfect . . . themselves . . . give testimony of Me."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> worked were a sufficient <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of His Godhead in three respects. First, as to the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the works, which surpassed the entire capability of <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> power, and therefore could not be done save by Divine power. For this reason the blind <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, after his sight had been restored, said (<a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse32">John 9:32-33</a>): "From the beginning of the world it has not been heard, that any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hath opened the eyes of one born blind. Unless this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> were of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he could not do anything."

<p>Secondly, as to the way in which He worked <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>--namely, because He worked <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> as though of His own power, and not by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, as others do. Wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse19">Luke 6:19</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> went out from Him and healed all." Whereby it is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, as Cyril says (Comment. in Lucam) that "He did not receive power from another, but, being <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, He showed His own power over the sick. And this is how He worked countless <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>." Hence on <a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse16">Matthew 8:16</a>: "He cast out spirits with His word, and all that were sick He healed," <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says: "Mark how great a multitude of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> healed, the Evangelists pass quickly over, not mentioning one by one . . . but in one word traversing an unspeakable sea of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>." And thus it was shown that His power was co-equal with that of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father, according to <a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse19">John 5:19</a>: "What things soever" the Father "doth, these the Son doth also in like manner"; and, again (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse21">John 5:21</a>): "As the Father raiseth up the dead and giveth life, so the Son also giveth life to whom He will."

<p>Thirdly, from the very fact that He taught that He was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for unless this were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> it would not be confirmed by <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> worked by Divine power. Hence it was said (<a href="../bible/mar001.htm#verse27">Mark 1:27</a>): "What is this new doctrine? For with power He commandeth the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> spirits, and they obey Him."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This was the argument of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. ad Volusian. cxxxvii): "No suitable wonders; say they, show forth the presence of so great majesty, for the ghostly cleansing" whereby He cast out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, "the cure of the sick, the raising of the dead to life, if other <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> be taken into account, are small things before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." To this <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> answers thus: "We own that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> did as much . . . But even <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> himself and the other <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> made <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the Lord the object of their <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, and gave Him great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> . . . He, therefore, chose to do similar things to avoid the inconsistency of failing to do what He had done through others. Yet still He was bound to do something which no other had done: to be born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, to rise from the dead, and to <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascend into heaven</a>. If anyone deem this a slight thing for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to do, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what more he can expect. Having become <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, ought He to have made another world, that we might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him to be Him by whom the world was made? But in this world neither a greater world could be made nor one equal to it: and if He had made a lesser world in comparison with this, that too would have been deemed a small thing."

<p>As to the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> worked by others, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did greater still. Hence on <a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse24">John 15:24</a>: "If I had not done in [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'among'] them the works that no other men hath done," etc., <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says: "None of the works of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> seem to be greater than the raising of the dead: which thing we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the ancient <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> also did . . . Yet <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did some works 'which no other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hath done.' But we are told in answer that others did works which He did not, and which none other did . . . But to heal with so great a power so many defects and ailments and grievances of mortal men, this we read concerning none soever of the men of old. To say nothing of those, each of whom by His bidding, as they came in His way, He made whole . . . Mark saith (<a href="../bible/mar006.htm#verse56">6:56</a>): 'Whithersoever He entered, into towns or into villages or into cities, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought Him that they might touch but the hem of His garment: and as many as touched Him were made whole.' These things none other did in them; for when He saith 'In them,' it is not to be understood to mean 'Among them,' or 'In their presence,' but wholly 'In them,' because He healed them . . . Therefore whatever works He did in them are works that none ever did; since if ever any other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> did any one of them, by His doing he did it; whereas these works He did, not by their doing, but by Himself."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> explains this passage of John as follows (Tract. lxxi): "What are these 'greater works' which believers in Him would do? That, as they passed by, their very shadow healed the sick? For it is greater that a shadow should heal than the hem of a garment . . . When, however, He said these words, it was the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> and works of His words that He spoke of: for when He said . . . 'The Father who abideth in Me, He doth the works,' what works did He mean, then, but the words He was speaking? . . . and the fruits of those same words was the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of those (who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>): but when the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> preached the Gospel, not some few like those, but the very nations <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> . . . (Tract. lxxii). Did not that rich <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> go away from His presence sorrowful? . . . and yet afterwards, what one <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, having heard from Him, did not, that many did when He spake by the mouth of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> . . . Behold, He did greater works when spoken of by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> than when speaking to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> hearing. But there is yet this difficulty: that He did these 'greater works' by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>: whereas He saith as meaning not only them: . . . 'He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> in Me' . . . Listen! . . . 'He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> in Me, the works that I do, he also shall do': first, 'I do,' then 'he also shall do,' because I do that he may do. What works--but that from ungodly he should be made righteous? . . . Which thing <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> worketh in him, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, but not without him. Yes, I may affirm this to be altogether greater than to create" [The words 'to create' are not in the text of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>] "<a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth . . . for '<a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth shall pass away'; but the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and justification of the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinate</a> shall remain . . . But also in the heavens . . . the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are the works of Christ: and does that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> do greater works than these, who co-operates with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in the work of his <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>? . . . let him, who can, judge whether it be greater to create a righteous being than to justify an ungodly one. Certainly if both are works of equal power, the latter is a work of greater mercy."

<p>"But there is no need for us to understand all the works of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, where He saith 'Greater than these shall he do.' For by 'these' He meant, perhaps, those which He was doing at that hour: now at that time He was speaking words of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: . . . and certainly it is less to preach words of righteousness, which thing He did without us, than to justify the ungodly, which thing He so doth in us that we also do it ourselves."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> When some particular work is proper to some agent, then that particular work is a sufficient <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the whole power of that agent: thus, since the act of reasoning is proper to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the mere fact that someone reasons about any particular proposition proves him to be a man. In like manner, since it is proper to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> by His own power, any single <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> worked by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by His own power is a sufficient <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.
