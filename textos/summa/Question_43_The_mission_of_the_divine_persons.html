<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether a divine person can be properly sent?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> cannot be properly sent. For one who is sent is less than the sender. But one divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is not less than another. Therefore one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is not sent by another.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, what is sent is separated from the sender; hence <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says, commenting on <a href="../bible/eze016.htm#verse53">Ezekiel 16:53</a>: "What is joined and tied in one body cannot be sent." But in the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> there is nothing that is separable, as <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (De Trin. vii). Therefore one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is not sent by another.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whoever is sent, departs from one place and comes anew into another. But this does not apply to a divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, Who is everywhere. Therefore it is not suitable for a divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to be sent.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse16">John 8:16</a>): "I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent Me."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> the notion of mission includes two things: the habitude of the one sent to the sender; and that of the one sent to the end whereto he is sent. Anyone being sent implies a certain kind of procession of the one sent from the sender: either according to command, as the master sends the servant; or according to counsel, as an adviser may be said to send the king to battle; or according to origin, as a tree sends forth its flowers. The habitude to the term to which he is sent is also shown, so that in some way he begins to be present there: either because in no way was he present before in the place whereto he is sent, or because he begins to be there in some way in which he was not there hitherto. Thus the mission of a divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is a fitting thing, as meaning in one way the procession of origin from the sender, and as meaning a new way of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in another; thus the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is said to be sent by the Father into the world, inasmuch as He began to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> visibly in the world by taking our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; whereas "He was" previously "in the world" (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John 1:1</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Mission implies inferiority in the one sent, when it means procession from the sender as principle, by command or counsel; forasmuch as the one commanding is the greater, and the counsellor is the wiser. In <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, however, it means only procession of origin, which is according to equality, as explained above (42, 4,6).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> What is so sent as to begin to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> where previously it did not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, is locally moved by being sent; hence it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> separated locally from the sender. This, however, has no place in the mission of a divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; for the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> sent neither begins to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> where he did not previously <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, nor ceases to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> where He was. Hence such a mission takes place without a separation, having only distinction of origin.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This objection rests on the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of mission according to local motion, which is not in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether mission is eternal, or only temporal?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that mission can be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xxvi, in Ev.), "The Son is sent as He is begotten." But the Son's generation is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. Therefore mission is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a thing is changed if it becomes something temporally. But a divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is not changed. Therefore the mission of a divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is not temporal, but <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, mission implies procession. But the procession of the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. Therefore mission is also <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse4">Galatians 4:4</a>): "When the fullness of the time was come, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent His Son."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A certain difference is to be observed in all the words that express the origin of the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. For some express only relation to the principle, as "procession" and "going forth." Others express the term of procession together with the relation to the principle. Of these some express the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> term, as "generation" and "spiration"; for generation is the procession of the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> into the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and passive spiration is the procession of the subsisting love. Others express the temporal term with the relation to the principle, as "mission" and "giving." For a thing is sent that it may be in something else, and is given that it may be possessed; but that a divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> be possessed by any creature, or <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in it in a new mode, is temporal.

<p>Hence "mission" and "giving" have only a temporal significance in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but "generation" and "spiration" are exclusively <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>; whereas "procession" and "giving," in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, have both an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and a temporal signification: for the Son may proceed <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but temporally, by becoming <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, according to His visible mission, or likewise by dwelling in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> according to His invisible mission.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> speaks of the temporal generation of the Son, not from the Father, but from His mother; or it may be taken to mean that He could be sent because <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> begotten.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> That a divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> may newly <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in anyone, or be possessed by anyone in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, does not come from change of the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, but from change in the creature; as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself is called Lord temporally by change of the creature.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Mission signifies not only procession from the principle, but also determines the temporal term of the procession. Hence mission is only temporal. Or we may say that it includes the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> procession, with the addition of a temporal effect. For the relation of a divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to His principle must be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. Hence the procession may be called a twin procession, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and temporal, not that there is a double relation to the principle, but a double term, temporal and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the invisible mission of the divine person is only according to the gift of sanctifying grace?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the invisible mission of the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is not only according to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>. For the sending of a divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> means that He is given. Hence if the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is sent only according to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> Himself will not be given, but only His <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>; and this is the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of those who say that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is not given, but that His <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are given.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, this preposition, "according to," denotes the habitude of some <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> why the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> is possessed, and not conversely, according to <a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans 5:5</a>, "the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is poured forth in our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, Who is given to us." Therefore it is improperly said that the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is sent according to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iv, 20) that "the Son, when temporally perceived by the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, is sent." But the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> not only by <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, but also by gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Therefore the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is not sent only according to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12617a.htm">Rabanus</a> says that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was given to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> for the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. This, however, is not a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, but a gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is not given only according to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iii, 4) that "the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> proceeds temporally for the creature's sanctification." But mission is a temporal procession. Since then the creature's sanctification is by <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, it follows that the mission of the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is only by <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is fittingly sent in the sense that He <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> newly in any one; and He is given as possessed by anyone; and neither of these is otherwise than by <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>.

<p>For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in all things by His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, power and presence, according to His one common mode, as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the effects which participate in His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Above and beyond this common mode, however, there is one special mode belonging to the rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> wherein <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said to be present as the object <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> is in the knower, and the beloved in the lover. And since the rational creature by its operation of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and love attains to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, according to this special mode <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said not only to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the rational creature but also to dwell therein as in His own temple. So no other effect can be put down as the reason why the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is in the rational creature in a new mode, except <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>. Hence, the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is sent, and proceeds temporally only according to <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>.

<p>Again, we are said to possess only what we can freely use or enjoy: and to have the power of enjoying the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> can only be according to <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>. And yet the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is possessed by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and dwells within him, in the very <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> itself of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> Himself is given and sent.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> By the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> the rational creature is perfected so that it can freely use not only the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> itself, but enjoy also the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> Himself; and so the invisible mission takes place according to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>; and yet the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> Himself is given.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Sanctifying <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> disposes the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to possess the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; and this is signified when it is said that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is given according to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> itself of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; which is meant by the words, "the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is poured forth in our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although the Son can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by us according to other effects, yet neither does He dwell in us, nor is He possessed by us according to those effects.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> manifests <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> as also does the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> and any other gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>. Hence gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is called the "manifestation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>" (<a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse7">1 Corinthians 12:7</a>). So the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is said to be given to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> for the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, because <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> was given to them with the outward sign. Were the sign only of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> given to them without the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> itself, it would not be simply said that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was given, except with some qualifying term; just as we read of certain ones receiving the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the spirit of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, or of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, as having from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> the power of prophesying or of working <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the Father can be fittingly sent?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is fitting also that the Father should be sent. For being sent means that the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is given. But the Father gives Himself since He can only be possessed by His giving Himself. Therefore it can be said that the Father sends Himself.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is sent according to the indwelling of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> the whole <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> dwells in us according to <a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse23">John 14:23</a>: "We will come to him and make Our abode with him." Therefore each one of the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is sent.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whatever belongs to one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, belongs to them all, except the notions and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. But mission does not signify any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; nor even a notion, since there are only five notions, as stated above (Question 32, Article 3). Therefore every divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> can be sent.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. ii, 3), "The Father alone is never described as being sent."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The very <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of mission means procession from another, and in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> it means procession according to origin, as above expounded. Hence, as the Father is not from another, in no way is it fitting for Him to be sent; but this can only belong to the Son and to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, to Whom it belongs to be from another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In the sense of "giving" as a free bestowal of something, the Father gives Himself, as freely bestowing Himself to be enjoyed by the creature. But as implying the authority of the giver as regards what is given, "to be given" only applies in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to the Person Who is from another; and the same as regards "being sent."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although the effect of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is also from the Father, Who dwells in us by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, just as the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, still He is not described as being sent, for He is not from another. Thus <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iv, 20) that "The Father, when <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by anyone in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, is not said to be sent; for there is no one whence He is, or from whom He proceeds."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Mission, meaning procession from the sender, includes the signification of a notion, not of a special notion, but in general; thus "to be from another" is common to two of the notions.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether it is fitting for the Son to be sent invisibly?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is not fitting for the Son to be sent invisibly. For invisible mission of the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is according to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But all <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> belong to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse11">1 Corinthians 12:11</a>: "One and the same Spirit worketh all things." Therefore only the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is sent invisibly.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the mission of the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is according to <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> belonging to the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> are not <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, since they can be held without the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse2">1 Corinthians 13:2</a>: "If I should have <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, and should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all mysteries, and all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and if I should have all <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> so that I could move mountains, and have not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, I am nothing." Therefore, since the Son proceeds as the word of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, it seems unfitting for Him to be sent invisibly.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the mission of the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is a procession, as expounded above (1,4). But the procession of the Son and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> differ from each other. Therefore they are distinct missions if both are sent; and then one of them would be superfluous, since one would suffice for the creature's sanctification.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said of divine Wisdom (<a href="../bible/wis009.htm#verse10">Wisdom 9:10</a>): "Send her from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> to Thy Saints, and from the seat of Thy greatness."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The whole <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> dwells in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> by <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse23">John 14:23</a>: "We will come to him, and will make Our abode with him." But that a divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> be sent to anyone by invisible <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> signifies both that this <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> dwells in a new way within him and that He has His origin from another. Hence, since both to the Son and to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> it belongs to dwell in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and to be from another, it therefore belongs to both of them to be invisibly sent. As to the Father, though He dwells in us by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, still it does not belong to Him to be from another, and consequently He is not sent.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although all the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, considered as such, are attributed to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, forasmuch as He is by His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> the first Gift, since He is Love, as stated above (Question 38, Article 1), some <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> nevertheless, by reason of their own particular <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, are appropriated in a certain way to the Son, those, namely, which belong to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and in respect of which we speak of the mission of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iv, 20) that "The Son is sent to anyone invisibly, whenever He is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and perceived by anyone."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is made like to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Hence for a divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to be sent to anyone by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, there must needs be a likening of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> Who is sent, by some <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Because the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is Love, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is assimilated to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: hence the mission of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is according to the mode of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Whereas the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is the Word, not any sort of word, but one Who breathes forth Love. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. ix 10): "The Word we speak of is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> with love." Thus the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is sent not in accordance with every and any kind of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> perfection, but according to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> illumination, which breaks forth into the affection of love, as is said (<a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse45">John 6:45</a>): "Everyone that hath heard from the Father and hath learned, cometh to Me," and (<a href="../bible/psa038.htm#verse4">Psalm 38:4</a>): "In my meditation a fire shall flame forth." Thus <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> plainly says (De Trin. iv, 20): "The Son is sent, whenever He is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and perceived by anyone." Now perception implies a certain experimental <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; and this is properly called wisdom [sapientia], as it were a sweet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> [sapida scientia], according to <a href="../bible/sir006.htm#verse23">Sirach 6:23</a>: "The wisdom of doctrine is according to her name."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Since mission implies the origin of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> Who is sent, and His indwelling by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as above explained (1), if we speak of mission according to origin, in this sense the Son's mission is distinguished from the mission of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as generation is distinguished from procession. If we consider mission as regards the effect of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, in this sense the two missions are united in the root which is <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but are distinguished in the effects of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which consist in the illumination of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and the kindling of the affection. Thus it is manifest that one mission cannot be without the other, because neither takes place without <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, nor is one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> separated from the other.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the invisible mission is to all who participate grace?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the invisible mission is not to all who participate <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For the Fathers of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> had their share of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Yet to them was made no invisible mission; for it is said (<a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse39">John 7:39</a>): "The Spirit was not yet given, because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was not yet glorified." Therefore the invisible mission is not to all partakers in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, progress in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is only by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But the invisible mission is not according to progress in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; because progress in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is continuous, since <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> ever increases or decreases; and thus the mission would be continuous. Therefore the invisible mission is not to all who share in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the blessed have fullness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But mission is not to them, for mission implies distance, whereas <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and all the blessed are perfectly united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore the invisible mission is not to all sharers in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the Sacraments of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> contain <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and it is not said that the invisible mission is sent to them. Therefore the invisible mission is not to all that have <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. iii, 4; xv, 27), the invisible mission is for the creature's sanctification. Now every creature that has <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is sanctified. Therefore the invisible mission is to every such creature.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As above stated (3,4,5), mission in its very meaning implies that he who is sent either begins to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> where he was not before, as occurs to creatures; or begins to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> where he was before, but in a new way, in which sense mission is ascribed to the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Thus, mission as regards the one to whom it is sent implies two things, the indwelling of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and a certain renewal by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Thus the invisible mission is sent to all in whom are to be found these two <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The invisible mission was directed to the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> Fathers, as appears from what <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iv, 20), that the invisible mission of the Son "is in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and with men. This was done in former times with the Fathers and the Prophets." Thus the words, "the Spirit was not yet given," are to be applied to that giving accompanied with a visible sign which took place on the day of Pentecost.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The invisible mission takes place also as regards progress in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> or increase of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iv, 20), that "the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is sent to each one when He is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and perceived by anyone, so far as He can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and perceived according to the capacity of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, whether journeying towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or united perfectly to Him." Such invisible mission, however, chiefly occurs as regards anyone's proficiency in the performance of a new act, or in the acquisition of a new state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a>; as, for example, the proficiency in reference to the <a href="../cathen/10350a.htm">gift of miracles</a> or of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, or in the fervor of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> leading a man to expose himself to the danger of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, or to renounce his possessions, or to undertake any arduous work.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The invisible mission is directed to the blessed at the very beginning of their beatitude. The invisible mission is made to them subsequently, not by "intensity" of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but by the further <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> of mysteries; which goes on till the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">day of judgment</a>. Such an increase is by the "extension" of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, because it extends to a greater number of objects. To <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the invisible mission was sent at the first moment of His conception; but not afterwards, since from the beginning of His conception He was filled with all wisdom and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Grace</a> resides instrumentally in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, as the form of a thing designed resides in the instruments of the art designing, according to a process flowing from the agent to the passive object. But mission is only spoken of as directed to its term. Hence the mission of the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is not sent to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, but to those who receive <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> through the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether it is fitting for the Holy Ghost to be sent visibly?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is not fittingly sent in a visible manner. For the Son as visibly sent to the world is said to be less than the Father. But the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is never said to be less than the Father. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is not fittingly sent in a visible manner.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the visible mission takes place by way of union to a visible creature, as the Son's mission according to the flesh. But the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> did not assume any visible creature; and hence it cannot be said that He <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> otherwise in some creatures than in others, unless perhaps as in a sign, as He is also present in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and in all the figures of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Thus the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is either not sent visibly at all, or His visible mission takes place in all these things.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every visible creature is an effect showing forth the whole <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is not sent by reason of those visible creatures more than any other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the Son was visibly sent by reason of the noblest kind of creature--namely, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore if the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is sent visibly, He ought to be sent by reason of rational creatures.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, whatever is done visibly by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is dispensed by the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iii, 4,5,9). So visible appearances, if there have been any, came by means of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Thus the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are sent, and not the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> being sent in a visible manner is only for the purpose of manifesting the invisible mission; as invisible things are made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the visible. So those to whom the invisible mission was not sent, ought not to receive the visible mission; and to all who received the invisible mission, whether in the New or in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, the visible mission ought likewise to be sent; and this is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is not sent visibly.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse16">Matthew 3:16</a>) that, when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> descended upon Him in the shape of a dove.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> provides for all things according to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of each thing. Now the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> requires that he be led to the invisible by visible things, as explained above (Question 12, Article 12). Wherefore the invisible things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> must be made manifest to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by the things that are visible. As <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, therefore, in a certain way has demonstrated Himself and His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> processions to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> by visible creatures, according to certain signs; so was it fitting that the invisible missions also of the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> should be made manifest by some visible creatures.

<p>This mode of manifestation applies in different ways to the Son and to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. For it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, Who proceeds as Love, to be the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of sanctification; to the Son as the principle of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, it belongs to the author of this sanctification. Thus the Son has been sent visibly as the author of sanctification; the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> as the sign of sanctification.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The Son assumed the visible creature, wherein He appeared, into the unity of His <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, so that whatever can be said of that creature can be said of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; and so, by reason of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> assumed, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is called less than the Father. But the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> did not assume the visible creature, in which He appeared, into the unity of His <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; so that what is said of it cannot be predicated of Him. Hence He cannot be called less than the Father by reason of any visible creature.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The visible mission of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> does not apply to the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision which is that of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>; because as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. ii, 6): "The <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> vision is not displayed to corporeal eyes by corporeal shapes, but is shown in the spirit by the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> images of bodies. But whoever saw the dove and the fire, saw them by their eyes. Nor, again, has the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> the same relation to these images that the Son has to the rock, because it is said, "The rock was <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>" (<a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse4">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>). For that rock was already <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>, and after the manner of an action was named <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Whom it typified; whereas the dove and the fire suddenly appeared to signify only what was happening. They seem, however, to be like to the flame of the burning bush seen by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and to the column which the people followed in the desert, and to the lightning and thunder issuing forth when the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was given on the mountain. For the purpose of the bodily appearances of those things was that they might signify, and then pass away." Thus the visible mission is neither displayed by <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> vision, which belongs to the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, and not to the body, nor by the sacramental signs of the Old and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, wherein certain pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> things are employed to signify something. But the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is said to be sent visibly, inasmuch as He showed Himself in certain creatures as in signs especially made for that purpose.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although the whole <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> makes those creatures, still they are made in order to show forth in some special way this or that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. For as the Father, Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are signified by diverse names, so also can They each one be signified by different things; although neither separation nor diversity <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> amongst Them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> It was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the Son to be declared as the author of sanctification, as explained above. Thus the visible mission of the Son was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> made according to the rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to which it belongs to act, and which is capable of sanctification; whereas any other creature could be the sign of sanctification. Nor was such a visible creature, formed for such a purpose, <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> assumed by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> into the unity of His <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, since it was not assumed or used for the purpose of action, but only for the purpose of a sign; and so likewise it was not required to last beyond what its use required.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Those visible creatures were formed by the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, not to signify the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, but to signify the Person of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Thus, as the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> resided in those visible creatures as the one signified in the sign, on that account the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is said to be sent visibly, and not as an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> It is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the invisible mission should always be made manifest by some visible external sign; but, as is said (<a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse7">1 Corinthians 12:7</a>)--"the manifestation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> is given to every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> unto profit"--that is, of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. This utility consists in the confirmation and propagation of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by such visible signs. This has been done chiefly by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, according to <a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse3">Hebrews 2:3</a>, "which having begun to be declared by the Lord, was confirmed unto us by them that heard."

<p>Thus in a special sense, a mission of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was directed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and to some of the early <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> on whom the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was in a way founded; in such a manner, however, that the visible mission made to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should show forth the invisible mission made to Him, not at that particular time, but at the first moment of His conception. The visible mission was directed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> at the time of His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> by the figure of a dove, a fruitful animal, to show forth in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the authority of the giver of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> by <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> regeneration; hence the Father's voice spoke, "This is My beloved Son" (<a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse17">Matthew 3:17</a>), that others might be regenerated to the likeness of the only Begotten. The <a href="../cathen/15019a.htm">Transfiguration</a> showed it forth in the appearance of a bright cloud, to show the exuberance of doctrine; and hence it was said, "Hear ye Him" (<a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse5">Matthew 17:5</a>). To the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> the mission was directed in the form of breathing to show forth the power of their ministry in the dispensation of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>; and hence it was said, "Whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> you shall forgive, they are forgiven" (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse23">John 20:23</a>): and again under the sign of fiery tongues to show forth the office of teaching; whence it is said that, "they began to speak with divers tongues" (<a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse4">Acts 2:4</a>). The visible mission of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was fittingly not sent to the fathers of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, because the visible mission of the Son was to be accomplished before that of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; since the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> manifests the Son, as the Son manifests the Father. Visible apparitions of the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> were, however, given to the Fathers of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> which, indeed, cannot be called visible missions; because, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. ii, 17), they were not sent to designate the indwelling of the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but for the manifestation of something else.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether a divine person is sent only by the person whence He proceeds eternally?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is sent only by the one whence He proceeds <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>. For as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iv), "The Father is sent by no one because He is from no one." Therefore if a divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is sent by another, He must be from that other.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the sender has authority over the one sent. But there can be no authority as regards a divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> except from origin. Therefore the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> sent must proceed from the one sending.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if a divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> can be sent by one whence He does not proceed, then the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> may be given by a man, although He proceeds not from him; which is contrary to what <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xv). Therefore the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is sent only by the one whence He proceeds.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The Son is sent by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, according to <a href="../bible/isa048.htm#verse16">Isaiah 48:16</a>, "Now the Lord <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath sent Me and His Spirit." But the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is not from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Therefore a divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is sent by one from Whom He does not proceed.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There are different opinions on this point. Some say that the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is sent only by the one whence He proceeds <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>; and so, when it is said that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is sent by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, this is to be explained as regards His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, by reason of which He was sent to preach by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, however, says (De Trin. ii, 5) that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is sent by Himself, and by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is sent by Himself, and by the Son; so that to be sent in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not apply to each <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, but only to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> proceeding from another, whereas to send belongs to each <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p>There is some <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in both of these opinions; because when a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is described as being sent, the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> Himself <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> from another is designated, with the visible or invisible effect, applicable to the mission of the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Thus if the sender be designated as the principle of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> sent, in this sense not each <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> sends, but that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> only Who is the principle of that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who is sent; and thus the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is sent only by the Father; and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> by the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. If, however, the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> sending is understood as the principle of the effect implied in the mission, in that sense the whole <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> sends the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> sent. This reason does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that a man can send the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, forasmuch as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the effect of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p>The answers to the objections appear from the above.
