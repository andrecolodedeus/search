<h1>Question 44. Christ's miracles considered specifically</h1>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether those miracles were fitting which Christ worked in spiritual substances?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that those <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were unfitting which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> worked in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. For among <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are above the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; for, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. ii.): "The treacherous and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> rational spirit of life is ruled by the rational, pious, and just spirit of life." But we read of no <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> worked by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Therefore neither should He have worked <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were ordained to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> His Godhead. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Godhead was not to be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>: since this would have hindered the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse8">1 Corinthians 2:8</a>: "If they had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> it, they would never have crucified the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>." Therefore He should not have worked <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were ordained to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: hence it is written (<a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse8">Matthew 9:8</a>) that "the multitudes seeing" that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> sick of the palsy had been healed by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, "feared, and glorified <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that gave such power to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> have no part in glorifying <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; since "praise is not seemly in the mouth of a sinner" (<a href="../bible/sir015.htm#verse9">Sirach 15:9</a>). For which reason also "He suffered them not to speak" (<a href="../bible/mar001.htm#verse34">Mark 1:34</a>; <a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse41">Luke 4:41</a>) those things which reflected <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> on Him. Therefore it seems that it was unfitting for Him to work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are ordained to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. But sometimes the casting out of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> from men was detrimental to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in some cases to the body: thus it is related (<a href="../bible/mar009.htm#verse24">Mark 9:24-25</a>) that a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> at <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> command, "crying out and greatly tearing" the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, "went out of him; and he became as dead, so that many said: He is dead"; sometimes also to things: as when He sent the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, at their own request, into the swine, which they cast headlong into the sea; wherefore the inhabitants of those parts "besought Him that He would depart from their coasts" (<a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse31">Matthew 8:31-34</a>). Therefore it seems unfitting that He should have worked such like <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> this was foretold (<a href="../bible/zec013.htm#verse2">Zechariah 13:2</a>), where it is written: "I will take away . . . the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> spirit out of the earth."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> worked by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> were arguments for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which He taught. Now, by the power of His Godhead He was to rescue those who would <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, from the power of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; according to <a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse31">John 12:31</a>: "Now shall the prince of this world be cast out." Consequently it was fitting that, among other <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, He should also deliver those who were obsessed by <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Just as men were to be delivered by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> from the power of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, so by Him were they to be brought to the companionship of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, according to <a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse20">Colossians 1:20</a>: "Making peace through the blood of His <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, both as to the things on earth and the things that are in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>." Therefore it was not fitting to show forth to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> other <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> as regards the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, except by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> appearing to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: as happened in His Nativity, His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, and His <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei ix): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> just as much as He willed; and He willed just as far as there was need. But He was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to them, not as to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, by that which is <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, but by certain temporal effects of His power." First, when they saw that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was hungry after <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> they deemed Him not to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Hence, on <a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse3">Luke 4:3</a>, "If Thou be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>," etc., <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says: "What means this way of addressing Him? save that, though He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was to come, yet he did not think that He had come in the weakness of the flesh?" But afterwards, when he saw Him work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, he had a sort of conjectural suspicion that He was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Hence on <a href="../bible/mar001.htm#verse24">Mark 1:24</a>, "I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> who Thou art, the Holy one of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> [Victor of Antioch. Cf. Catena Aurea] says that "he had no certain or firm <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> coming." Yet he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that He was "the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> promised in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>," wherefore it is said (<a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse41">Luke 4:41</a>) that "they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that He was <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." But it was rather from suspicion than from <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> that they confessed Him to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> says on <a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse41">Luke 4:41</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> confess the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and, as stated farther on, 'they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that He was <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.' For when the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> saw Him weakened by His fast, He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him to be a real <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: but when He failed to overcome Him by <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, He <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> lest He should be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. And now from the power of His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> He either <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, or rather suspected that He was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. His reason therefore for persuading the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> to crucify Him was not that he deemed Him not to be <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> or the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, but because he did not foresee that he would be the loser by His death. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says of this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>" (<a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse7">1 Corinthians 2:7-8</a>), "which is hidden from the beginning, that 'none of the princes of this world <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it,' for if they had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> it they would never have crucified the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> worked in expelling <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> were for the benefit, not of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, but of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that they might glorify Him. Wherefore He forbade them to speak in His praise. First, to give us an example. For, as <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> says, "He restrained his speech, although he was confessing the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; to teach us not to care about such things, although it may seem that what is said is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. For it is wrong to seek to learn from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> when we have the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Divine Scripture</a>": Besides, it is dangerous, since the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> frequently mix falsehood with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Or, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> [Cyril of Alexandria, Comment. in Luc.] says: "It was not meet for them to usurp the prerogative of the apostolic office. Nor was it fitting that the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should be proclaimed by a corrupt tongue" because "praise is not seemly in the mouth of a sinner" [Cf. Theophylact, Enarr. in Luc.]. Thirdly, because, as <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> says, "He did not wish the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> to be aroused thereby" [<a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>, Expos. in Luc. iv, 41]. Hence "even the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> are commanded to be silent about Him, lest, if His Divine majesty were proclaimed, the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> should be deferred."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> came specially to teach and to work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and principally as to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Consequently, He allowed the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, that He cast out, to do <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> some harm, either in his body or in his goods, for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>--namely, for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> instruction. Hence <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says on <a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse32">Matthew 8:32</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> let the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> depart into the swine, "not as yielding to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, but first, to show . . . how harmful are the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> who attack men; secondly, that all might learn that the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> would not dare to hurt even the swine, except He allow them; thirdly, that they would have treated those men more grievously than they treated the swine, unless they had been protected by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>."

<p>And for the same motives He allowed the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who was being delivered from the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, to suffer grievously for the moment; yet did He release him at once from that distress. By this, moreover, we are taught, as <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> says on <a href="../bible/mar009.htm#verse25">Mark 9:25</a>, that "often, when after falling into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> we strive to return to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we experience further and more grievous attacks from the old enemy. This he does, either that he may inspire us with a distaste for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, or that he may avenge the shame of having been cast out." For the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who was healed "became as dead," says <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, "because to those who are healed it is said, 'You are dead; and your life is hid with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>'" (<a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse3">Colossians 3:3</a>)

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether it was fitting that Christ should work miracles in the heavenly bodies?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it was unfitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in the heavenly bodies. For, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv), "it beseems <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a> not to destroy, but to preserve, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." Now, the heavenly bodies are by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> incorruptible and unchangeable, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> De Coelo i. Therefore it was unfitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> any change in the order of the heavenly bodies.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the course of time is marked out by the movement of the heavenly bodies, according to <a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse14">Genesis 1:14</a>: "Let there be lights made in the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> . . . and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years." Consequently if the movement of the heavenly bodies be changed, the distinction and order of the seasons is changed. But there is no report of this having been perceived by <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomers</a>, "who gaze at the stars and observe the months," as it is written (<a href="../bible/isa047.htm#verse13">Isaiah 47:13</a>). Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not work any change in the movements of the heavenly bodies.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it was more fitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in life and when teaching, than in death: both because, as it is written (<a href="../bible/2co013.htm#verse4">2 Corinthians 13:4</a>), "He was crucified through weakness, yet He liveth by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," by which He worked <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>; and because His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were in confirmation of His doctrine. But there is no record of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> having worked any <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in the heavenly bodies during His lifetime: nay, more; when the Pharisees asked Him to give "a sign from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>," He refused, as Matthew relates (12,16). Therefore it seems that neither in His death should He have worked any <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in the heavenly bodies.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse44">Luke 23:44-45</a>): "There was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour; and the sun was darkened."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 43, Article 4) it behooved <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> to be a sufficient <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of His Godhead. Now this is not so sufficiently <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by changes wrought in the lower bodies, which changes can be brought about by other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, as it is by changes wrought in the course of the heavenly bodies, which have been established by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone in an unchangeable order. This is what <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says in his epistle to Polycarp: "We must recognize that no alteration can take place in the order end movement of the heavens that is not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by Him who made all and changes all by His word." Therefore it was fitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> even in the heavenly bodies.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Just as it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to the lower bodies to be moved by the heavenly bodies, which are higher in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, so is it <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to any creature whatsoever to be changed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Faust. xxvi; quoted by the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse24">Romans 11:24</a>: "Contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> thou wert grafted," etc.): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a> and Author of all <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, does nothing contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: for whatsoever He does in each thing, that is its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." Consequently the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a heavenly body is not destroyed when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> changes its course: but it would be if the change were due to any other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The order of the seasons was not disturbed by the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> worked by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For, according to some, this gloom or darkening of the sun, which occurred at the time of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> passion, was <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the sun withdrawing its rays, without any change in the movement of the heavenly bodies, which measures the duration of the seasons. Hence <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on <a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse45">Matthew 27:45</a>: "It seems as though the 'greater light' withdrew its rays, lest it should look on its Lord hanging on the Cross, or bestow its radiancy on the impious blasphemers." And this withdrawal of the rays is not to be understood as though it were in the sun's power to send forth or withdraw its rays: for it sheds its light, not from choice, but by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv). But the sun is said to withdraw its rays in so far as the Divine power <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> the sun's rays not to reach the earth. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> says this was <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by clouds coming between (the earth and the sun). Hence on <a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse45">Matthew 27:45</a> he says: "We must therefore suppose that many large and very dense clouds were massed together over Jerusalem and the land of Judea; so that it was exceedingly dark from the sixth to the ninth hour. Hence I am of opinion that, just as the other signs which occurred at the time of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>"--namely, "the rending of the veil, the quaking of the earth," etc.--"took place in Jerusalem only, so this also: . . . or if anyone prefer, it may be extended to the whole of Judea," since it is said that "'there was darkness over the whole earth,' which expression refers to the land of Judea, as may be gathered from <a href="../bible/1ki018.htm#verse10">1 Kings 18:10</a>, where Abdias says to Elias: 'As the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> liveth, there is no nation or kingdom whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee': which shows that they sought him among the nations in the neighborhood of Judea."

<p>On this point, however, credence is to be given rather to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a>, who is an eyewitness as to this having occurred by the moon eclipsing the sun. For he says (Ep. ad Polycarp): "Without any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> we saw the moon encroach on the sun," he being in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> at the time, as he says in the same letter. And in this he points out four <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. The first is that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> eclipse of the sun by interposition of the moon never takes place except when the sun and moon are in conjunction. But then the sun and moon were in opposition, it being the fifteenth day, since it was the Jewish Passover. Wherefore he says: "For it was not the time of conjunction."--The second <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> is that whereas at the sixth hour the moon was seen, together with the sun, in the middle of the heavens, in the evening it was seen to be in its place, i.e. in the east, opposite the sun. Wherefore he says: "Again we saw it," i.e. the moon, "return supernaturally into opposition with the sun," so as to be diametrically opposite, having withdrawn from the sun "at the ninth hour," when the darkness ceased, "until evening." From this it is clear that the wonted course of the seasons was not disturbed, because the Divine power <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> the moon both to approach the sun supernaturally at an unwonted season, and to withdraw from the sun and return to its proper place according to the season. The third <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> was that the eclipse of the sun <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> always begins in that part of the sun which is to the west and spreads towards the east: and this is because the moon's proper movement from west to east is more rapid than that of the sun, and consequently the moon, coming up from the west, overtakes the sun and passes it on its eastward course. But in this case the moon had already passed the sun, and was distant from it by the length of half the heavenly circle, being opposite to it: consequently it had to return eastwards towards the sun, so as to come into apparent contact with it from the east, and continue in a westerly direction. This is what he refers to when he says: "Moreover, we saw the eclipse begin to the east and spread towards the western edge of the sun," for it was a total eclipse, "and afterwards pass away." The fourth <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> consisted in this, that in a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> eclipse that part of the sun which is first eclipsed is the first to reappear (because the moon, coming in front of the sun, by its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> movement passes on to the east, so as to come away first from the western portion of the sun, which was the first part to be eclipsed), whereas in this case the moon, while returning <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> from the east to the west, did not pass the sun so as to be to the west of it: but having reached the western edge of the sun returned towards the east: so that the last portion of the sun to be eclipsed was the first to reappear. Consequently the eclipse began towards the east, whereas the sun began to reappear towards the west. And to this he refers by saying: "Again we observed that the occultation and emersion did not begin from the same point," i.e. on the same side of the sun, "but on opposite sides."

<p><a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> adds a fifth <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> (Hom. lxxxviii in Matth.), saying that "the darkness in this case lasted for three hours, whereas an eclipse of the sun lasts but a short time, for it is soon over, as those <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> who have seen one." Hence we are given to understand that the moon was stationary below the sun, except we prefer to say that the duration of the darkness was measured from the first moment of occultation of the sun to the moment when the sun had completely emerged from the eclipse.

<p>But, as <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> says (on <a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse45">Matthew 27:45</a>), "against this the children of this world object: How is it such a phenomenal occurrence is not related by any writer, whether Greek or barbarian?" And he says that someone of the name of Phlegon "relates in his chronicles that this took place during the reign of Tiberius Caesar, but he does not say that it occurred at the full moon." It may be, therefore, that because it was not the time for an eclipse, the various <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomers</a> living then throughout the world were not on the look-out for one, and that they ascribed this darkness to some disturbance of the atmosphere. But in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, where clouds are few on account of the tranquillity of the air, <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> and his companions were considerably astonished so as to make the aforesaid observations about this darkness.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Then, above all, was there need for <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Godhead, when the weakness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was most apparent in Him. Hence it was that at His birth a new star appeared in the heavens. Wherefore Maximus says (Serm. de Nativ. viii): "If thou disdain the manger, raise thine eyes a little and gaze on the new star in the heavens, proclaiming to the world the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>." But in His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> yet greater weakness appeared in His manhood. Therefore there was need for yet greater <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in the greater lights of the world. And, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. lxxxviii in Matth.): "This is the sign which He promised to them who sought for one saying: 'An <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulterous</a> generation seeketh a sign; and a sign shall not be given it, but the sign of <a href="../cathen/08497b.htm">Jonah the prophet</a>,' referring to His Cross . . . and <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> . . . For it was much more wonderful that this should happen when He was crucified than when He was walking on earth."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether Christ worked miracles fittingly on men?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> worked <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> unfittingly on men. For in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is of more import than the body. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> worked many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> on bodies, but we do not read of His working any <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> on <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>: for neither did He convert any unbelievers to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> mightily, but by persuading and convincing them with outward <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, nor is it related of Him that He made wise men out of fools. Therefore it seems that He worked <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> on men in an unfitting manner.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as stated above (Question 43, Article 2), <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> worked <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> by Divine power: to which it is proper to work suddenly, perfectly, and without any assistance. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not always heal men suddenly as to their bodies: for it is written (<a href="../bible/mar008.htm#verse22">Mark 8:22-25</a>) that, "taking the blind <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by the hand, He led him out of the town; and, spitting upon his eyes, laying His hands on him, He asked him if he saw anything. And, looking up, he said: I see men as it were trees walking. After that again He laid His hands upon his eyes, and he began to see, and was restored, so that he saw all things clearly." It is clear from this that He did not heal him suddenly, but at first imperfectly, and by means of His spittle. Therefore it seems that He worked <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> on men unfittingly.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, there is no need to remove at the same time things which do not follow from one another. Now bodily ailments are not always the result of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as appears from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> words (<a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse3">John 9:3</a>): "Neither hath this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, nor his parents, that he should be born blind." It was unseemly, therefore, for Him to forgive the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of those who sought the healing of the body, as He is related to have done in the case of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> sick of the palsy (<a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse2">Matthew 9:2</a>): the more that the healing of the body, being of less account than the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, does not seem a sufficient argument for the power of forgiving <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were worked in order to confirm His doctrine, and witness to His Godhead, as stated above (Question 43, Article 4). Now no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should hinder the purpose of his own work. Therefore it seems unfitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> commanded those who had been healed <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> to tell no one, as appears from <a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse30">Matthew 9:30</a> and <a href="../bible/mar008.htm#verse26">Mark 8:26</a>: the more so, since He commanded others to proclaim the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> worked on them; thus it is related (<a href="../bible/mar005.htm#verse19">Mark 5:19</a>) that, after delivering a man from the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, He said to him: "Go into thy house to thy friends, and tell them, how great things the Lord hath done for thee."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mar007.htm#verse37">Mark 7:37</a>): "He hath done all things well: He hath made both the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The means should be proportionate to the end. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> came into the world and taught in order to save <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse17">John 3:17</a>: "For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent not His Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world may be saved by Him." Therefore it was fitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> healing men in particular, should <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> Himself to be the universal and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> Saviour of all.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The means are distinct from the end. Now the end for which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were worked was the health of the rational part, which is healed by the light of wisdom, and the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of righteousness: the former of which presupposes the latter, since, as it is written (<a href="../bible/wis001.htm#verse4">Wisdom 1:4</a>): "Wisdom will not enter into a malicious <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, nor dwell in a body subject to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." Now it was unfitting that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be made righteous unless he willed: for this would be both against the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of righteousness, which implies rectitude of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and contrary to the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, which requires to be led to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, not by force. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, therefore, justified <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> inwardly by the Divine power, but not against <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will. Nor did this pertain to His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, but to the end of His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. In like manner by the Divine power He infused wisdom into the simple minds of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: hence He said to them (<a href="../bible/luk021.htm#verse15">Luke 21:15</a>): "I will give you a mouth and wisdom" which "all your adversaries will not be able to resist and gainsay." And this, in so far as the enlightenment was inward, is not to be reckoned as a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, but only as regards the outward action--namely, in so far as men saw that those who had been unlettered and simple spoke with such wisdom and constancy. Wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse13">Acts 4:13</a>) that the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, "seeing the constancy of Peter and of John, understanding that they were illiterate and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> men . . . wondered."--And though such like <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> effects are different from visible <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, yet do they testify to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> doctrine and power, according to <a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse4">Hebrews 2:4</a>: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> also bearing them witness by signs and wonders and divers <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and distributions of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>."

<p>Nevertheless <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did work some <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, principally by changing its lower powers. Hence <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse9">Matthew 9:9</a>, "He rose up and followed Him," says: "Such was the splendor and majesty of His hidden Godhead, which shone forth even in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> countenance, that those who gazed on it were drawn to Him at first sight." And on <a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse12">Matthew 21:12</a>, "(<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>) cast out all them that sold and bought," the same <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says: "Of all the signs worked by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>, this seems to me the most wondrous--that one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, at that time despised, could, with the blows of one scourge, cast out such a multitude. For a fiery and heavenly light flashed from His eyes, and the majesty of His Godhead shone in His countenance." And <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> says on <a href="../bible/joh002.htm#verse15">John 2:15</a> that "this was a greater <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> than when He changed water into wine, for there He shows His power over inanimate <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, whereas here He tames the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of thousands of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>." Again, on <a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse6">John 18:6</a>, "They went backward and fell to the ground," <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says: "Though that crowd was fierce in <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> and terrible with arms, yet did that one word . . . without any weapon, smite them through, drive them back, lay them prostrate: for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> lay hidden in that flesh." Moreover, to this must be referred what Luke says (<a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse30">4:30</a>) -- namely, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, "passing through the midst of them, went His way," on which <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> observes (Hom. xlviii in Joan.): "That He stood in the midst of those who were lying in wait for Him, and was not seized by them, shows the power of His Godhead"; and, again, that which is written <a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse59">John 8:59</a>, "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> hid Himself and went out of the Temple," on which Theophylact says: "He did not hide Himself in a corner of the Temple, as if afraid, or take shelter behind a wall or pillar; but by His heavenly power making Himself invisible to those who were threatening Him, He passed through the midst of them."

<p>From all these instances it is clear that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, when He willed, changed the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> by His Divine power, not only by the bestowal of righteousness and the infusion of wisdom, which pertains to the end of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, but also by outwardly drawing men to Himself, or by terrifying or stupefying them, which pertains to the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> itself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> came to save the world, not only by Divine power, but also through the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>. Consequently in healing the sick He frequently not only made use of His Divine power, healing by way of command, but also by applying something pertaining to His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence on <a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse40">Luke 4:40</a>, "He, laying His hands on every one of them, healed them," Cyril says: "Although, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He might, by one word, have driven out all diseases, yet He touched them, showing that His own flesh was endowed with a healing <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>." And on <a href="../bible/mar008.htm#verse23">Mark 8:23</a>, "Spitting upon his eyes, laying His hands on him," etc., <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> [Victor of Antioch] says: "He spat and laid His hands upon the blind <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, wishing to show that His Divine word, accompanied by His operation, works wonders: for the hand signifies operation; the spittle signifies the word which proceeds from the mouth." Again, on <a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse6">John 9:6</a>, "He made clay of the spittle, and spread the clay upon the eyes of the blind <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says: "Of His spittle He made clay--because 'the Word was made flesh.'" Or, again, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says, to signify that it was He who made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of "the slime of the earth."

<p>It is furthermore to be observed concerning <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> that generally what He did was most perfect. Hence on <a href="../bible/joh002.htm#verse10">John 2:10</a>, "Every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> at first setteth forth <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> wine," <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says: "Christ's <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are such as to far surpass the works of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in splendor and usefulness." Likewise in an instant He conferred perfect health on the sick. Hence on <a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse15">Matthew 8:15</a>, "She arose and ministered to them," <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says: "Health restored by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> returns wholly and instantly."

<p>There was, however, special reason for the contrary happening in the case of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> born blind, and this was his want of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> [Victor of Antioch] says. Or as <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> observes on <a href="../bible/mar008.htm#verse23">Mark 8:23</a>: "Whom He might have healed wholly and instantly by a single word, He heals little by little, to show the extent of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> blindness, which hardly, and that only by degrees, can come back to the light: and to point out that each step forward in the way of perfection is due to the help of His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (Question 43, Article 2), <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> worked <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> by Divine power. Now "the works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are perfect" (<a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse4">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>). But nothing is perfect except it attain its end. Now the end of the outward healing worked by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the healing of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Consequently it was not fitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should heal a man's body without healing his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Wherefore on <a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse23">John 7:23</a>, "I have healed the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> on a Sabbath day," <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says: "Because he was cured, so as to be whole in body; he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, so as to be whole in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>." To the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> sick of the palsy it is said specially, "Thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven thee," because, as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> observes on <a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse5">Matthew 9:5-6</a>: "We are hereby given to understand that ailments of the body are frequently due to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: for which reason, perhaps, first are his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> forgiven, that the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the ailment being removed, health may return." Wherefore, also (<a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse14">John 4:14</a>), it is said: "Sin no more, lest some worse thing happen to thee." Whence, says <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>, "we learn that his sickness was the result of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>."

<p>Nevertheless, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says on <a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse5">Matthew 9:5</a>: "By how much a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is of more account than a body, by so much is the forgiving of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> a greater work than healing the body; but because the one is unseen He does the lesser and more manifest thing in order to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the greater and more unseen."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> On <a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse30">Matthew 9:30</a>, "See that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this," <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says: "If in another place we find Him saying, 'Go and declare the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>' (cf. <a href="../bible/mar005.htm#verse19">Mark 5:19</a>; <a href="../bible/luk008.htm#verse39">Luke 8:39</a>), that is not contrary to this. For He instructs us to forbid them that would praise us on our own account: but if the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> be referred to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then we must not forbid, but command, that it be done."

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether Christ worked miracles fittingly on irrational creatures?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> worked <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> unfittingly on irrational creatures. For brute animals are more noble than plants. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> worked a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> on plants as when the fig-tree withered away at His command (<a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse19">Matthew 21:19</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should have worked <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> also on brute animals.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, punishment is not <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> inflicted save for fault. But it was not the fault of the fig-tree that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> found no fruit on it, when fruit was not in season (<a href="../bible/mar011.htm#verse13">Mark 11:13</a>). Therefore it seems unfitting that He withered it up.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, air and water are between <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> worked some <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in the heavens, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), and likewise in the earth, when it quaked at the time of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> (<a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse51">Matthew 27:51</a>). Therefore it seems that He should also have worked <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in the air and water, such as to divide the sea, as did <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> (<a href="../bible/exo014.htm#verse21">Exodus 14:21</a>); or a river, as did <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Josue</a> (<a href="../bible/jos003.htm#verse16">Joshua 3:16</a>) and Elias (<a href="../bible/2ki002.htm#verse8">2 Kings 2:8</a>); and to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> thunder to be heard in the air, as occurred on <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Mount Sinai</a> when the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> was given (<a href="../bible/exo019.htm#verse16">Exodus 19:16</a>), and like to what Elias did (<a href="../bible/1ki018.htm#verse45">1 Kings 18:45</a>).

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> works pertain to the work of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a> in governing the world. But this work presupposes creation. It seems, therefore, unfitting that in His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> made use of creation: when, to wit, He multiplied the loaves. Therefore His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in regard to irrational creatures seem to have been unfitting.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is "the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse24">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>), of whom it is said (<a href="../bible/wis008.htm#verse1">Wisdom 8:1</a>) that "she ordereth all things sweetly."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were ordained to the end that He should be recognized as having Divine power, unto the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. Now it belongs to the Divine power that every creature be subject thereto. Consequently it behooved Him to work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> on every kind of creature, not only on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but also on irrational creatures.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Brute animals are akin generically to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, wherefore they were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> on the same day as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. And since He had worked many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> on the bodies of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, there was no need for Him to work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> on the bodies of brute animals. and so much the less that, as to their sensible and corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the same reason applies to both men and animals, especially terrestrial. But fish, from living in water, are more alien from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; wherefore they were made on another day. On them <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> worked a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> in the plentiful draught of fishes, related <a href="../bible/luk005.htm">Luke 5</a> and <a href="../bible/joh021.htm">John 21</a>; and, again, in the fish caught by Peter, who found a stater in it (<a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse26">Matthew 17:26</a>). As to the swine who were cast headlong into the sea, this was not the effect of a Divine <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, but of the action of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> permitting.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says on <a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse19">Matthew 21:19</a>: "When <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> does any such like thing" on plants or brute animals, "ask not how it was just to wither up the fig-tree, since it was not the fruit season; to ask such a question is foolish in the extreme," because such things cannot commit a fault or be punished: "but look at the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, and wonder at the worker." Nor does the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a> "inflict" any hurt on the owner, if He choose to make use of His own creature for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of others; rather, as <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says on <a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse19">Matthew 21:19</a>, "we should see in this a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, for when He wished to afford an example of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> as being procured by Him, He exercised His mighty power on the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body: but when He wished to picture to them His severity towards those who wilfully disobey Him, He foreshadows their doom by His sentence on the tree." This is the more noteworthy in a fig-tree which, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> observes (on <a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse19">Matthew 21:19</a>), "being full of moisture, makes the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> all the more remarkable."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> also worked <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> befitting to Himself in the air and water: when, to wit, as related <a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse26">Matthew 8:26</a>, "He commanded the winds, and the sea, and there came a great calm." But it was not befitting that He who came to restore all things to a state of peace and calm should <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> either a disturbance in the atmosphere or a division of waters. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse18">Hebrews 12:18</a>): "You are not come to a fire that may be touched and approached [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'a mountain that might be touched, and a burning fire', and a whirlwind, and darkness, and storm."

<p>At the time of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, however, the "veil was rent," to signify the unfolding of the mysteries of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>; "the graves were opened," to signify that His death gave life to the dead; "the earth quaked and the rocks were rent," to signify that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> stony heart would be softened, and the whole world changed for the better by the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The multiplication of the loaves was not effected by way of creation, but by an addition of extraneous <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> transformed into loaves; hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says on <a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse1">John 6:1-14:</a> "Whence He multiplieth a few grains into harvests, thence in His hands He multiplied the five loaves": and it is clearly by a process of transformation that grains are multiplied into harvests.
