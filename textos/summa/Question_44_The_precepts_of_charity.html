<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether any precept should be given about charity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that no precept should be given about <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> imposes the mode on all acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since it is the form of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> as stated above (Question 23, Article 8), while the precepts are about the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> themselves. Now, according to the common saying, the mode is not included in the precept. Therefore no precepts should be given about <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which "is poured forth in our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans 5:5</a>), makes us free, since "where the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> is, there is liberty" (<a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse17">2 Corinthians 3:17</a>). Now the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> that arises from a precept is opposed to liberty, since it imposes a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. Therefore no precept should be given about <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is the foremost among all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, to which the precepts are directed, as shown above (I-II, 90, 2; I-II, 100, 09). If, therefore, any precepts were given about <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, they should have a place among the chief precepts which are those of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>.

<p>But they have no place there. Therefore no precepts should be given about <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Whatever <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> requires of us is included in a precept. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> requires that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should love Him, according to <a href="../bible/deu010.htm#verse12">Deuteronomy 10:12</a>. Therefore it behooved precepts to be given about the love of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which is the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (16, 1; I-II, 99, 1), a precept implies the notion of something due. Hence a thing is a matter of precept, in so far as it is something due. Now a thing is due in two ways, for its own sake, and for the sake of something else. On every affair, it is the end that is due for its own sake, because it has the character of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for its own sake: while that which is directed to the end is due for the sake of something else: thus for a physician, it is due for its own sake, that he should heal, while it is due for the sake of something else that he should give a medicine in order to heal. Now the end of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life is that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and this union is effected by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, while all things pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life are ordained to this union, as to their end. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse5">1 Timothy 1:5</a>): "The end of the commandment is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> from a pure heart, and a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and an unfeigned <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>." For all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, about whose acts the precepts are given, are directed either to the freeing of the heart from the whirl of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>--such are the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> that regulate the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>--or at least to the possession of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>--such are the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> that regulate operations--or to the having of a right <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>--such are those which pertain to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and these three things are required of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that he may love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For an impure heart is withdrawn from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, on account of the passion that inclines it to earthly things; an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> gives <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> a horror for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, through fear of His punishments; and an <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> draws <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> affections to an <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a> representation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and separates him from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now in every genus that which is for its own sake takes precedence of that which is for the sake of another, wherefore the greatest precept is that of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as stated in <a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse39">Matthew 22:39</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (I-II, 100, 10) when we were treating of the commandments, the mode of love does not come under those precepts which are about the other acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: for instance, this precept, "Honor thy father and thy mother," does not prescribe that this should be done out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. The act of love does, however, fall under special precepts.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of a precept is not opposed to liberty, except in one whose mind is averted from that which is prescribed, as may be seen in those who keep the precepts through fear alone. But the precept of love cannot be fulfilled save of one's own will, wherefore it is not opposed to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> All the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> are directed to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of our neighbor: and therefore the precepts of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> had not to be enumerated among the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>, since they are included in all of them.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether there should have been given two precepts of charity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there should not have been given two precepts of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> are directed to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated above (1, Objection 3). Now <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as shown above (Question 33, Article 5). Therefore only one precept of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> should have been given.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 22,27), <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> loves none but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in our neighbor. Now we are sufficiently directed to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the precept, "Thou shalt love the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>." Therefore there was no need to add the precept about <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> our neighbor.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, different <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are opposed to different precepts. But it is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to put aside the love of our neighbor, provided we put not aside the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; indeed, it is written (<a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse26">Luke 15:26</a>): "If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> come to Me, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> not his father, and mother . . . he cannot be My disciple." Therefore the precept of the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not distinct from the precept of the love of our neighbor.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse8">Romans 13:8</a>): "He that loveth his neighbor hath fulfilled the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>." But a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is not fulfilled unless all its precepts be observed. Therefore all the precepts are included in the love of our neighbor: and consequently the one precept of the love of our neighbor suffices. Therefore there should not be two precepts of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse21">1 John 4:21</a>): "This commandment we have from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that he who loveth <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, love also his brother."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (I-II, 91, 3; I-II, 94, 2) when we were treating of the commandments, the precepts are to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> what propositions are to speculative <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, for in these latter, the conclusions are virtually contained in the first principles. Hence whoever <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the principles as to their entire virtual extent has no need to have the conclusions put separately before him. Since, however, some who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the principles are unable to consider all that is virtually contained therein, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, for their sake, that scientific conclusions should be traced to their principles. Now in practical matters wherein the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> direct us, the end has the character of principle, as stated above (23, 07, ad 2; 26, 1, ad 1): and the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the end to which the love of our neighbor is directed. Therefore it behooved us to receive precepts not only of the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> but also of the love of our neighbor, on account of those who are less <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a>, who do not easily understand that one of these precepts is included in the other.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, yet it has two acts, one of which is directed to the other as to its end. Now precepts are given about acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and so there had to be several precepts of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is loved in our neighbor, as the end is loved in that which is directed to the end; and yet there was need for an explicit precept about both, for the reason given above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The means derive their <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> from their relation to the end, and accordingly aversion from the means derives its <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> from the same source and from no other

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Love of our neighbor includes love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the end is included in the means, and vice versa: and yet it behooved each precept to be given explicitly, for the reason given above.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether two precepts of charity suffice?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that two precepts of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> do not suffice. For precepts are given about acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now acts are distinguished by their objects. Since, then, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is bound to love four things out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, namely, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, himself, his neighbor and his own body, as shown above (25, 12; 26), it seems that there ought to be four precepts of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, so that two are not sufficient.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, love is not the only <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, but also <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, peace and beneficence. But precepts should be given about the acts of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Therefore two precepts of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> do not suffice.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> consists not only in doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> but also in avoiding <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Now we are led by the positive precepts to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and by the negative precepts to avoid <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore there ought to have been not only positive, but also negative precepts about <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; and so two precepts of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> are not sufficient.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse40">Matthew 22:40</a>): "On these two commandments dependeth the whole Law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a>, as stated above (Question 23, Article 1), is a kind of friendship. Now friendship is between one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and another, wherefore <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. in Ev. xvii): "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> is not possible between less than two": and it has been explained how one may love oneself out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> (25, 4). Now since <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is the object of dilection and love, and since <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is either an end or a means, it is fitting that there should be two precepts of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, one whereby we are induced to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as our end, and another whereby we are led to love our neighbor for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake, as for the sake of our end

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 23), "though four things are to be loved out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, there was no need of a precept as regards the second and fourth," i.e. love of oneself and of one's own body. "For however much a man may stray from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the love of himself and of his own body always remains in him." And yet the mode of this love had to be prescribed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, namely, that he should love himself and his own body in an ordinate manner, and this is done by his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and his neighbor.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above (28, 4; 29, 3), the other acts of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> result from the act of love as effects from their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Hence the precepts of love virtually include the precepts about the other acts. And yet we find that, for the sake of the laggards, special precepts were given about each act--about <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> (<a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse4">Philippians 4:4</a>): "Rejoice in the Lord always"--about peace (<a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse14">Hebrews 12:14</a>): "Follow peace with all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>"--about beneficence (<a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse10">Galatians 6:10</a>): "Whilst we have time, let us work <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>"--and <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> contains precepts about each of the parts of beneficence, as may be seen by anyone who considers the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> carefully.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> To do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is more than to avoid <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and therefore the positive precepts virtually include the negative precepts. Nevertheless we find explicit precepts against the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: for, against <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> it is written (<a href="../bible/lev012.htm#verse17">Leviticus 12:17</a>): "Thou shalt not <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> thy brother in thy heart"; against sloth (<a href="../bible/sir006.htm#verse26">Sirach 6:26</a>): "Be not grieved with her bands"; against <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse26">Galatians 5:26</a>): "Let us not be made desirous of vainglory, provoking one another, envying one another"; against discord (<a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse10">1 Corinthians 1:10</a>): "That you all speak the same thing, and that there be no schisms among you"; and against <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> (<a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse13">Romans 14:13</a>): "That you put not a stumbling-block or a <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> in your brother's way."

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether it is fittingly commanded that man should love God with his whole heart?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is unfittingly commanded that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with his whole heart. For the mode of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> act is not a matter of precept, as shown above (1, ad 1; I-II, 100, 09). Now the words "with thy whole heart" signify the mode of the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore it is unfittingly commanded that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with his whole heart.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "A thing is whole and perfect when it lacks nothing" (Phys. iii, 6). If therefore it is a matter of precept that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be loved with the whole heart, whoever does something not pertaining to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, acts counter to the precept, and consequently <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally. Now a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not pertain to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is absurd.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with one's whole heart belongs to perfection, since according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Phys. iii, text. 64), "to be whole is to be perfect." But that which belongs to perfection is not a matter of precept, but a matter of counsel. Therefore we ought not to be commanded to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with our whole heart.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse5">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>): "Thou shalt love the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> with thy whole heart."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since precepts are given about acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, an act is a matter of precept according as it is an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now it is requisite for an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that not only should it fall on its own <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but also that it should be endued with its due circumstances, whereby it is adapted to that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is to be loved as the last end, to which all things are to be referred. Therefore some kind of totality was to be indicated in connection with the precept of the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The commandment that prescribes an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> does not prescribe the mode which that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> derives from another and higher <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but it does prescribe the mode which belongs to its own proper <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and this mode is signified in the words "with thy whole heart."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> To love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with one's whole heart has a twofold signification. First, actually, so that a man's whole heart be always actually directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: this is the perfection of heaven. Secondly, in the sense that a man's whole heart be <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a> directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so that it consent to nothing contrary to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and this is the perfection of the way. Venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not contrary to this latter perfection, because it does not destroy the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, since it does not tend to a contrary object, but merely hinders the use of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> That perfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> to which the counsels are directed, is between the two perfections mentioned in the preceding reply: and it consists in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> renouncing, as much as possible, temporal things, even such as are lawful, because they occupy the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> and hinder the actual movement of the heart towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether to the words, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart," it was fitting to add "and with thy whole soul, and with thy whole strength"?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it was unfitting to the words, "Thou shalt love the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>, with thy whole heart," to add, "and with thy whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and with thy whole strength" (<a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse5">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>). For heart does not mean here a part of the body, since to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not a bodily action: and therefore heart is to be taken here in a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> sense. Now the heart understood spiritually is either the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself or part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore it is superfluous to mention both heart and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a man's strength whether <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> or corporal depends on the heart. Therefore after the words, "Thou shalt love the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> with thy whole heart," it was unnecessary to add, "with all thy strength."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in <a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse37">Matthew 22:37</a> we read: "With all thy mind," which words do not occur here. Therefore it seems that this precept is unfittingly worded in <a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse5">Deuteronomy 6</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary</strong> stands the authority of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> This precept is differently worded in various places: for, as we said in the first objection, in <a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse5">Deuteronomy 6</a> three points are mentioned: "with thy whole heart," and "with thy whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>," and "with thy whole strength." On <a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse37">Matthew 22</a> we find two of these mentioned, viz. "with thy whole heart" and "with thy whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>," while "with thy whole strength" is omitted, but "with thy whole mind" is added. Yet in <a href="../bible/mar012.htm">Mark 12</a> we find all four, viz. "with thy whole heart," and "with thy whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>," and "with thy whole mind," and "with thy whole force" which is the same as "strength." Moreover, these four are indicated in <a href="../bible/luk010.htm">Luke 10</a>, where in place of "strength" or "force" we read "with all thy might." [<a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> is explaining the <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> text which reads "ex tota fortitudine tua" (<a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse5">Deuteronomy</a>), "ex tota <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> tua" (<a href="../bible/mar012.htm">Mark</a>), and "ex omnibus tuis" (<a href="../bible/luk010.htm">Luke</a>), although the Greek in all three cases has <em>ex holes tes ischyos</em>, which the <a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a> renders "with thy whole strength."]

<p>Accordingly these four have to be explained, since the fact that one of them is omitted here or there is due to one implying another. We must therefore observe that love is an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> which is here denoted by the "heart," because just as the bodily heart is the principle of all the movements of the body, so too the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, especially as regards the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the last end which is the object of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, is the principle of all the movements of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Now there are three principles of action that are moved by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, namely, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> which is signified by "the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>," the lower <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, signified by "the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>"; and the exterior executive power signified by "strength," "force" or "might." Accordingly we are commanded to direct our whole <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and this is signified by the words "with thy whole heart"; to submit our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and this is expressed in the words "with thy whole mind"; to regulate our <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the words "with thy whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>"; and to obey <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in our external actions, and this is to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with our whole "strength," "force" or "might."

<p><a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> [The quotation is from an anonymous author's unfinished work (Opus imperf. Hom. xlii, in Matth.) which is included in <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom's</a> works], on the other hand, takes "heart" and "<a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>" in the contrary sense; and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (<a href="../fathers/12021.htm#21"><em>On Christian Doctrine</em> I:21</a>) refers "heart" to the thought, "<a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>" to the manner of life, and "mind" to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Again some explain "with thy whole heart" as denoting the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, "with thy whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>" as signifying the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, "with thy mind" as pointing to the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>. And again, according to <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> (De Hom. Opif. viii), "heart" signifies the vegetative <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, "<a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>" the sensitive, and "mind" the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, because our nourishment, sensation, and understanding ought all to be referred by us to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether it is possible in this life to fulfil this precept of the love of God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in this life it is possible to fulfil this precept of the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For according to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> [Pelagius, Exposit. Cath. Fid.] "<a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">accursed</a> is he who says that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has commanded anything impossible." But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave this commandment, as is clear from <a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse5">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>. Therefore it is possible to fulfil this precept in this life.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whoever does not fulfil a precept <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally, since according to <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> (De Parad. viii) <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is nothing else than "a transgression of the Divine Law, and disobedience of the heavenly commandments." If therefore this precept cannot be fulfilled by wayfarers, it follows that in this life no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can be without mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and this is against the saying of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse8">1 Corinthians 1:8</a>): "(Who also) will confirm you unto the end without crime," and (<a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse10">1 Timothy 3:10</a>): "Let them minister, having no crime."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, precepts are given in order to direct <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the way of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa018.htm#verse9">Psalm 18:9</a>: "The commandment of the Lord is lightsome, enlightening the eyes." Now it is useless to direct anyone to what is impossible. Therefore it is not impossible to fulfill this precept in this life.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Perfect. Justit. viii): "In the fulness of heavenly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> this precept will be fulfilled: Thou shalt love the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>," etc. For as long as any carnal <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> remains, that can be restrained by <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with all his heart.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A precept can be fulfilled in two ways; perfectly, and imperfectly. A precept is fulfilled perfectly, when the end intended by the author of the precept is reached; yet it is fulfilled, imperfectly however, when although the end intended by its author is not reached, nevertheless the order to that end is not departed from. Thus if the commander of an army order his soldiers to fight, his command will be perfectly obeyed by those who fight and conquer the foe, which is the commander's <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>; yet it is fulfilled, albeit imperfectly, by those who fight without gaining the victory, provided they do nothing contrary to military discipline. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> intends by this precept that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be entirely united to Him, and this will be realized in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will be "all in all," according to <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse28">1 Corinthians 15:28</a>. Hence this precept will be observed fully and perfectly in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>; yet it is fulfilled, though imperfectly, on the way. Nevertheless on the way one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will fulfil it more perfectly than another, and so much the more, as he approaches by some kind of likeness to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument proves that the precept can be fulfilled after a fashion on the way, but not perfectly.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Even as the soldier who fights legitimately without conquering is not blamed nor deserves to be punished for this, so too he that does not fulfil this precept on the way, but does nothing against the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> mortally.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Perfect. Justit. viii), "why should not this perfection be prescribed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, although no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> attains it in this life? For one cannot run straight unless one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> whither to run. And how would one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this if no precept pointed it out."

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the precept of love of our neighbor is fittingly expressed?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the precept of the love of our neighbor is unfittingly expressed. For the love of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> extends to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, even to our enemies, as may be seen in <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse44">Matthew 5:44</a>. But the word "neighbor" denotes a kind of "nighness" which does not seem to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> towards all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Therefore it seems that this precept is unfittingly expressed.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. ix, 8) "the origin of our friendly relations with others lies in our relation to ourselves," whence it seems to follow that love of self is the origin of one's love for one's neighbor. Now the principle is greater than that which results from it. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ought not to love his neighbor as himself.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> loves himself, but not his neighbor, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>. Therefore it is unfitting that he should be commanded to love his neighbor as himself.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse39">Matthew 22:39</a>): "The second" commandment "is like to this: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> This precept is fittingly expressed, for it indicates both the reason for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> and the mode of love. The reason for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> is indicated in the word "neighbor," because the reason why we ought to love others out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is because they are nigh to us, both as to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and as to the capacity for <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Nor does it matter whether we say "neighbor," or "brother" according to <a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse21">1 John 4:21</a>, or "friend," according to <a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse18">Leviticus 19:18</a>, because all these words express the same affinity.

<p>The mode of love is indicated in the words "as thyself." This does not mean that a man must love his neighbor equally as himself, but in like manner as himself, and this in three ways. First, as regards the end, namely, that he should love his neighbor for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake, even as he loves himself for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake, so that his love for his neighbor is a "<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>" love. Secondly, as regards the rule of love, namely, that a man should not give way to his neighbor in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but only in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, even as he ought to gratify his will in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things alone, so that his love for his neighbor may be a "righteous" love. Thirdly, as regards the reason for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a>, namely, that a man should love his neighbor, not for his own profit, or pleasure, but in the sense of wishing his neighbor well, even as he wishes himself well, so that his love for his neighbor may be a "<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>" love: since when a man loves his neighbor for his own profit or pleasure, he does not love his neighbor <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, but loves himself.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether the order of charity is included in the precept?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the order of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not included in the precept. For whoever transgresses a precept does a wrong. But if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> loves some one as much as he ought, and loves any other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> more, he wrongs no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore he does not transgress the precept. Therefore the order of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not included in the precept.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever is a matter of precept is sufficiently delivered to us in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>. Now the order of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> which was given above (<a href="#26">Article 26</a>) is nowhere indicated in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>. Therefore it is not included in the precept.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, order implies some kind of distinction. But the love of our neighbor is prescribed without any distinction, in the words, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." Therefore the order of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not included in the precept.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Whatever <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> works in us by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, He teaches us first of all by His Law, according to <a href="../bible/jer031.htm#verse33">Jeremiah 31:33</a>: "I will give My Law in their heart [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'in their bowels, and I will write it in their heart']." Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> in us the order of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, according to <a href="../bible/son002.htm#verse4">Canticles 2:4</a>: "He set in order <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> in me." Therefore the order of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> comes under the precept of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (4, ad 1), the mode which is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> comes under the precept which prescribes that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> act. Now the order of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since it is based on the proportion of love to the thing beloved, as shown above (25, 12; 26, 1 and 2). It is therefore evident that the order of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> must come under the precept.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> gratifies more the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> he loves more, so that if he loved less one whom he ought to love more, he would wish to gratify more one whom he ought to gratify less, and so he would do an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> to the one he ought to love more.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The order of those four things we have to love out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is expressed in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>. For when we are commanded to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with our "whole heart," we are given to understand that we must <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him above all things. When we are commanded to love our neighbor "as ourselves," the love of self is set before love of our neighbor. On like manner where we are commanded (<a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse16">1 John 3:16</a>) "to lay down our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>," i.e. the life of our bodies, "for the brethren," we are given to understand that a man ought to love his neighbor more than his own body; and again when we are commanded (<a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse10">Galatians 6:10</a>) to "work <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> . . . especially to those who are of the household of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>," and when a man is blamed (<a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse8">1 Timothy 5:8</a>) if he "have not care of his own, and especially of those of his house," it means that we ought to love most those of our neighbors who are more <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> or more closely united to us.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It follows from the very words, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor" that those who are nearer to us are to be loved more.
