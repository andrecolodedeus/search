<h1>Question 44. The procession of creatures from God, and of the first cause of all things</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1044.htm#article1"> Is God the efficient cause of all beings?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1044.htm#article2"> Is primary matter created by God, or is an independent coordinate principle with Him?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1044.htm#article3"> Is God the exemplar cause of beings or are there other exemplar causes?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1044.htm#article4"> Is He the final cause of things?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether it is necessary that every being be created by God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that every being be <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For there is nothing to prevent a thing from being without that which does not belong to its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, as a man can be found without whiteness. But the relation of the thing <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> to its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> does not appear to be <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to beings, for some beings can be understood without it; therefore they can <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> without it; and therefore it is possible that some beings should not be <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a thing requires an efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> in order to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>. Therefore whatever cannot but <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> does not require an efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But no <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> thing can not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, because whatever <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> cannot but <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>. Therefore as there are many <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> things in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, it appears that not all beings are from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whatever things have a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, can be demonstrated by that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But in mathematics demonstration is not made by the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as appears from the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. iii, text 3); therefore not all beings are from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as from their efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse36">Romans 11:36</a>): "Of Him, and by Him, and in Him are all things."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It must be said that every being in any way <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For whatever is found in anything by participation, must be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in it by that to which it belongs <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, as iron becomes ignited by fire. Now it has been shown above (Question 3, Article 4) when treating of the divine simplicity that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> self-subsisting Being; and also it was shown (11, 3,4) that subsisting being must be one; as, if whiteness were self-subsisting, it would be one, since whiteness is multiplied by its recipients. Therefore all beings apart from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are not their own being, but are beings by participation. Therefore it must be that all things which are diversified by the diverse participation of being, so as to be more or less perfect, are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by one First Being, Who possesses being most perfectly.

<p>Hence <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> said (Parmen. xxvi) that unity must come before multitude; and <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> said (Metaph. ii, text 4) that whatever is greatest in being and greatest in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of every being and of every <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; just as whatever is the greatest in heat is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all heat.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Though the relation to its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is not part of the definition of a thing <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a>, still it follows, as a consequence, on what belongs to its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; because from the fact that a thing has being by participation, it follows that it is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a>. Hence such a being cannot be without being <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a>, just as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot be without having the faculty of laughing. But, since to be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> does not enter into the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of being as such, therefore is it possible for us to find a being uncaused.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This objection has led some to say that what is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> has no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> (Phys. viii, text 46). But this is manifestly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> in the demonstrative <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, where <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> principles are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> conclusions. And therefore <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> says (Metaph. v, text 6), that there are some <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> things which have a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of their <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. But the reason why an efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is required is not merely because the effect is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, but because the effect might not be if the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> were not. For this conditional proposition is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, whether the antecedent and consequent be possible or impossible.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The science of mathematics treats its object as though it were something abstracted <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mentally</a>, whereas it is not abstract in reality. Now, it is becoming that everything should have an efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> in proportion to its being. And so, although the object of mathematics has an efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, still, its relation to that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is not the reason why it is brought under the consideration of the mathematician, who therefore does not demonstrate that object from its efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether primary matter is created by God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is not <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For whatever is made is composed of a subject and of something else (Phys. i, text 62). But primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> has no subject. Therefore primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> cannot have been made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, action and passion are opposite members of a division. But as the first active principle is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so the first passive principle is <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> are two principles divided against each other, neither of which is from the other.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every agent produces its like, and thus, since every agent acts in proportion to its <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a>, it follows that everything made is in some degree actual. But primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is only in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, formally considered in itself. Therefore it is against the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to be a thing made.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. xii, 7), Two "things hast Thou made, O Lord; one nigh unto Thyself"--viz. <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>--"the other nigh unto nothing"--viz. primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The ancient <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> gradually, and as it were step by step, advanced to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. At first being of grosser mind, they failed to realize that any beings <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> except sensible bodies. And those among them who admitted movement, did not consider it except as regards certain <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, for instance, in relation to rarefaction and condensation, by union and separation. And supposing as they did that corporeal <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> itself was uncreated, they assigned certain <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> for these <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> changes, as for instance, affinity, discord, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, or something of that kind. An advance was made when they understood that there was a distinction between the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form and <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, which latter they <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagined</a> to be uncreated, and when they perceived transmutation to take place in bodies in regard to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> forms. Such transmutations they attributed to certain universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, such as the oblique circle [The zodiac], according to <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> (De Gener. ii), or <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>. But we must take into consideration that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is contracted by its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> to a determinate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, belonging to a certain <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, is contracted by a supervening <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> to a determinate mode of being; for instance, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by whiteness. Each of these opinions, therefore, considered "being" under some particular aspect, either as "this" or as "such"; and so they assigned particular efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> to things. Then others there were who arose to the consideration of "being," as being, and who assigned a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to things, not as "these," or as "such," but as "beings."

<p>Therefore whatever is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of things considered as beings, must be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of things, not only according as they are "such" by <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> forms, nor according as they are "these" by <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> forms, but also according to all that belongs to their being at all in any way. And thus it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to say that also primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by the universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Phys. i, text 62), is speaking of "becoming" in particular--that is, from form to form, either <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> or <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a>. But here we are speaking of things according to their emanation from the universal principle of being; from which emanation <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> itself is not excluded, although it is excluded from the former mode of being made.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> is an effect of action. Hence it is reasonable that the first passive principle should be the effect of the first active principle, since every imperfect thing is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by one perfect. For the first principle must be most perfect, as <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> says (Metaph. xii, text 40).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The reason adduced does not show that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is not <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>, but that it is not <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> without form; for though everything <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> is actual, still it is not <a href="../cathen/01125b.htm">pure act</a>. Hence it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that even what is <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a> in it should be <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>, if all that belongs to its being is <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the exemplar cause is anything besides God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the exemplar <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is something besides <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the effect is like its exemplar <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But creatures are far from being like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not their exemplar <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever is by participation is reduced to something self-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a>, as a thing ignited is reduced to fire, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). But whatever <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in sensible things <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> only by participation of some <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. This appears from the fact that in all sensible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is found not only what belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but also individuating principles added to the principles of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Therefore it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to admit self-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as for instance, a "per se" <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and a "per se" horse, and the like, which are called the exemplars. Therefore exemplar <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> besides <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> and definitions are concerned with <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> themselves, but not as these are in particular things, because there is no science or definition of particular things. Therefore there are some beings, which are beings or <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in singular things, and these are called exemplars. Therefore the same conclusion follows as above.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, this likewise appears from <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a>, who says (Div. Nom. v) that self-subsisting being is before self-subsisting life, and before self-subsisting wisdom.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The exemplar is the same as the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>. But <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (QQ. 83, qu. 46), are "the master forms, which are contained in the divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>." Therefore the exemplars of things are not outside <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the first exemplar <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all things. In <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> whereof we must consider that if for the production of anything an exemplar is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, it is in order that the effect may receive a determinate form. For an artificer produces a determinate form in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> by reason of the exemplar before him, whether it is the exemplar beheld externally, or the exemplar interiorily conceived in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. Now it is manifest that things made by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> receive determinate forms. This determination of forms must be reduced to the divine wisdom as its first principle, for divine wisdom devised the order of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, which order consists in the variety of things. And therefore we must say that in the divine wisdom are the types of all things, which types we have called <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>--i.e. exemplar forms <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the divine mind (15, 1). And these <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, though multiplied by their relations to things, in reality are not apart from the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, according as the likeness to that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> can be shared diversely by different things. In this manner therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself is the first exemplar of all things. Moreover, in things <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> one may be called the exemplar of another by the reason of its likeness thereto, either in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, or by the analogy of some kind of imitation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although creatures do not attain to a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> likeness to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> according to similitude of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as a man begotten is like to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> begetting, still they do attain to likeness to Him, forasmuch as they represent the divine <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, as a material house is like to the house in the architect's mind.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is of a man's <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to be in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and so a man without <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is impossible. Therefore although this particular <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is a man by participation of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, he cannot be reduced to anything self-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but to a superior <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, such as separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. The same applies to other sensible things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although every science and definition is concerned only with beings, still it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that a thing should have the same mode in reality as the thought of it has in our understanding. For we abstract universal <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> by force of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> from the particular <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>; but it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the universals should <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> outside the particulars in order to be their exemplars.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv), by "self-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> life and self-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> wisdom" he sometimes denotes <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, sometimes the powers given to things themselves; but not any self-subsisting things, as the ancients asserted.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether God is the final cause of all things?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all things. For to act for an end seems to imply need of the end. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> needs nothing. Therefore it does not become Him to act for an end.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the end of generation, and the form of the thing generated, and the agent cannot be identical (Phys. ii, text 70), because the end of generation is the form of the thing generated. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the first agent producing all things. Therefore He is not the final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all things.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, all things desire their end. But all things do not desire <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for all do not even <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the end of all things.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is the first of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. If, therefore, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and the final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, it follows that before and after <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in Him; which is impossible.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/pro016.htm#verse4">Proverbs 16:4</a>): "The Lord has made all things for Himself."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Every agent acts for an end: otherwise one thing would not follow more than another from the action of the agent, unless it were by chance. Now the end of the agent and of the patient considered as such is the same, but in a different way respectively. For the impression which the agent intends to produce, and which the patient intends to receive, are one and the same. Some things, however, are both agent and patient at the same time: these are imperfect agents, and to these it belongs to intend, even while acting, the acquisition of something. But it does not belong to the First Agent, Who is agent only, to act for the acquisition of some end; He intends only to communicate His perfection, which is His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>; while every creature intends to acquire its own perfection, which is the likeness of the divine perfection and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Therefore the divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is the end of all things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> To act from need belongs only to an imperfect agent, which by its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is both agent and patient. But this does not belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and therefore He alone is the most perfectly liberal giver, because He does not act for His own profit, but only for His own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The form of the thing generated is not the end of generation, except inasmuch as it is the likeness of the form of the generator, which intends to communicate its own likeness; otherwise the form of the thing generated would be more noble than the generator, since the end is more noble than the means to the end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> All things desire <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as their end, when they desire some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thing, whether this desire be <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> or sensible, or <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, i.e. without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; because nothing is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and desirable except forasmuch as it participates in the likeness to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the efficient, the exemplar and the final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all things, and since primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is from Him, it follows that the first principle of all things is one in reality. But this does not prevent us from <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mentally</a> considering many things in Him, some of which come into our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> before others.
