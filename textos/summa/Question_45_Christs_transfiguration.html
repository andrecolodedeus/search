<h1>Question 45. Christ's transfiguration</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/4045.htm#article1"> Was it fitting that Christ should be transfigured?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4045.htm#article2"> Was the clarity of the transfiguration the clarity of glory?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4045.htm#article3"> The witnesses of the transfiguration</a> <li><a href="../summa/4045.htm#article4"> The testimony of the Father's voice</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether it was fitting that Christ should be transfigured?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it was not fitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should be transfigured. For it is not fitting for a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body to be changed into various shapes [figuras, but only for an <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> body. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was not <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a>, but real, as stated above (Question 5, Article 1). Therefore it seems that it should not have been transfigured.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, figure is in the fourth <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, whereas clarity is in the third, since it is a sensible <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>. Therefore Christ's assuming clarity should not be called a <a href="../cathen/15019a.htm">transfiguration</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a glorified body has four <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, as we shall state farther on (XP, 82), viz. impassibility, agility, subtlety, and clarity. Therefore His <a href="../cathen/15019a.htm">transfiguration</a> should not have consisted in an assumption of clarity rather than of the other <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse2">Matthew 17:2</a>) that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> "was transfigured" in the presence of three of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>, after foretelling His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, had exhorted them to follow the path of His sufferings (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse21">Matthew 16:21-24</a>). Now in order that anyone go straight along a road, he must have some <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the end: thus an archer will not shoot the arrow straight unless he first see the target. Hence Thomas said (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse5">John 14:5</a>): "Lord, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whither Thou goest; and how can we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the way?" Above all is this <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> when hard and rough is the road, heavy the going, but delightful the end. Now by His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> Christ achieved <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, not only of His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, not only of His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which He had from the first moment of His conception, but also of His body; according to Luke (24:26): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> ought [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'ought not Christ'] to have suffered these things, and so to enter into His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> (?)." To which <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> He brings those who follow the footsteps of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, according to <a href="../bible/act014.htm#verse21">Acts 14:21</a>: "Through many tribulations we must enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>." Therefore it was fitting that He should show His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His clarity (which is to be transfigured), to which He will configure those who are His; according to <a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse21">Philippians 3:21</a>: "(Who) will reform the body of our lowness configured [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'made like'] to the body of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>." Hence <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> says on <a href="../bible/mar008.htm#verse39">Mark 8:39</a>: "By His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> foresight He allowed them to taste for a short time the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, so that they might bear <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> bravely."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on <a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse2">Matthew 17:2</a>: "Let no one suppose that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>," through being said to be transfigured, "laid aside His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> shape and countenance, or substituted an <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> or aerial body for His real body. The Evangelist describes the manner of His <a href="../cathen/15019a.htm">transfiguration</a> when he says: 'His face did shine as the sun, and His garments became white as snow.' Brightness of face and whiteness of garments argue not a change of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, but a putting on of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Figure is seen in the outline of a body, for it is "that which is enclosed by one or more boundaries" [Euclid, bk i, def. xiv]. Therefore whatever has to do with the outline of a body seems to pertain to the figure. Now the clarity, just as the color, of a non-transparent body is seen on its surface, and consequently the assumption of clarity is called <a href="../cathen/15019a.htm">transfiguration</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Of those four <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, clarity alone is a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of the very <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in himself; whereas the other three are not perceptible, save in some action or movement, or in some passion. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, then, did show in Himself certain indications of those three <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>--of agility, for instance, when He walked on the waves of the sea; of subtlety, when He came forth from the closed womb of the Virgin; of impassibility, when He escaped unhurt from the hands of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> who wished to hurl Him down or to stone Him. And yet He is not said, on account of this, to be transfigured, but only on account of clarity, which pertains to the aspect of His Person.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether this clarity was the clarity of glory?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that this clarity was not the clarity of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. For a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> on <a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse2">Matthew 17:2</a>, "He was transfigured before them," says: "In His mortal body He shows forth, not the state of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, but clarity like to that of future <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>." But the clarity of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is the clarity of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. Therefore the clarity which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> showed to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> was not the clarity of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, on <a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse27">Luke 9:27</a> "(That) shall not taste death unless [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'till'] they see the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>," <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede's</a> <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "That is, the glorification of the body in an <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision of future beatitude." But the image of a thing is not the thing itself. Therefore this was not the clarity of beatitude.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the clarity of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is only in a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body. But this clarity of the <a href="../cathen/15019a.htm">transfiguration</a> was seen not only in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, but also in His garments, and in "the bright cloud" which "overshaded" the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. Therefore it seems that this was not the clarity of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on the words "He was transfigured before them" (<a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse2">Matthew 17:2</a>): "He appeared to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> such as He will appear on the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">day of judgment</a>." And on <a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse28">Matthew 16:28</a>, "Till they see the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> coming in His kingdom," <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says: "Wishing to show with what kind of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> He is afterwards to come, so far as it was possible for them to learn it, He showed it to them in their present life, that they might not grieve even over the death of their Lord."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The clarity which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> assumed in His <a href="../cathen/15019a.htm">transfiguration</a> was the clarity of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> as to its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, but not as to its mode of being. For the clarity of the glorified body is derived from that of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. ad Diosc. cxviii). And in like manner the clarity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body in His <a href="../cathen/15019a.htm">transfiguration</a> was derived from His <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. head, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (Orat. de Transfig.) and from the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. That the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> did not overflow into His body from the first moment of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> conception was due to a certain Divine dispensation, that, as stated above (14, 1, ad 2), He might fulfil the mysteries of our redemption in a passible body. This did not, however, deprive <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> of His power of outpouring the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> into His body. And this He did, as to clarity, in His <a href="../cathen/15019a.htm">transfiguration</a>, but otherwise than in a glorified body. For the clarity of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> overflows into a glorified body, by way of a permanent <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> affecting the body. Hence bodily refulgence is not <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> in a glorified body. But in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/15019a.htm">transfiguration</a> clarity overflowed from His Godhead and from His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> into His body, not as an immanent <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> affecting His very body, but rather after the manner of a transient passion, as when the air is lit up by the sun. Consequently the refulgence, which appeared in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body then, was <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a>: just as was the fact of His walking on the waves of the sea. Hence <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Ep. ad Cai. iv): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> excelled <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in doing that which is proper to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: this is shown in His <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> conception of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> and in the unstable waters bearing the weight of material and earthly feet."

<p>Wherefore we must not say, as <a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugh of St. Victor</a> [<a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, De Myst. Miss. iv] said, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> assumed the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of clarity in the <a href="../cathen/15019a.htm">transfiguration</a>, of agility in walking on the sea, and of subtlety in coming forth from the Virgin's closed womb: because the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are immanent <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> of a glorified body.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> whatever pertained to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, that He had <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a>. The same is to be said, as to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, of the vision in which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> saw <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a>, as we have stated in the II-II, 175, 3, ad 2.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The words quoted <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>, not that the clarity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not that of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, but that it was not the clarity of a glorified body, since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was not as yet <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>. And just as it was by dispensation that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> should not overflow into the body so was it possible that by dispensation it might overflow as to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of clarity and not as to that of impassibility.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This clarity is said to have been <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a>, not as though it were not really the clarity of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, but because it was a kind of image representing that perfection of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, in virtue of which the body will be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Just as the clarity which was in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was a representation of His body's future clarity, so the clarity which was in His garments signified the future clarity of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, which will be surpassed by that of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, just as the brightness of the snow is surpassed by that of the sun. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxii) that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> garments became resplendent, "because in the height of heavenly clarity all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will cling to Him in the refulgence of righteousness. For His garments signify the righteous, because He will unite them to Himself," according to <a href="../bible/isa049.htm#verse18">Isaiah 49:18</a>: "Thou shalt be clothed with all these as with an ornament."

<p>The bright cloud signifies the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> or the "power of the Father," as <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> says (Tract. iii in Matth.), by which in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to come the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will be covered. Or, again, it may be said fittingly that it signifies the clarity of the world redeemed, which clarity will cover the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> as a tent. Hence when Peter proposed to make tents, "a bright cloud overshaded" the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the witnesses of the transfiguration were fittingly chosen?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15019a.htm">transfiguration</a> were unfittingly chosen. For everyone is a better witness of things that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>. But at the time of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/15019a.htm">transfiguration</a> no one but the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> had as yet any <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from experience of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to come. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15019a.htm">transfiguration</a> should have been <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> rather than men.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, not fiction, is becoming in a witness of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Now, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elias were there, not really, but only in appearance; for a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse30">Luke 9:30</a>, "They were <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elias," says: "It must be observed that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elias were there neither in body nor in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>"; but that those bodies were formed "of some available <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. It is also credible that this was the result of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> ministries, through the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> impersonating them." Therefore it seems that they were unsuitable <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is said (<a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse43">Acts 10:43</a>) that "all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> give testimony" to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore not only <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elias, but also all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, should have been present as <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is promised as a reward to all the faithful (<a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse18">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>; <a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse21">Philippians 3:21</a>), in whom He wished by His <a href="../cathen/15019a.htm">transfiguration</a> to enkindle a desire of that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Therefore He should have taken not only Peter, James, and John, but all His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, to be <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> of His <a href="../cathen/15019a.htm">transfiguration</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary</strong> is the authority of the Gospel.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> wished to be transfigured in order to show men His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and to arouse men to a desire of it, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are brought to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> beatitude by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>--not only those who lived after Him, but also those who preceded Him; therefore, when He was approaching His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, both "the multitude that followed" and that "which went before, cried saying: 'Hosanna,'" as related <a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse9">Matthew 21:9</a>, beseeching Him, as it were, to save them. Consequently it was fitting that <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> should be present from among those who preceded Him--namely, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elias--and from those who followed after Him--namely, Peter, James, and John--that "in the mouth of two or three <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>" this word might stand.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> By His <a href="../cathen/15019a.htm">transfiguration</a> Christ manifested to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His body, which belongs to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> only. It was therefore fitting that He should choose men and not <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> as <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> is said to be taken from a book entitled On the Marvels of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Scripture</a>. It is not an authentic work, but is wrongly ascribed to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>; consequently we need not stand by it. For <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on <a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse3">Matthew 17:3</a>: "Observe that when the Scribes and Pharisees asked for a sign from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, He refused to give one; whereas here in order to increase the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles'</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, He gives a sign from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, Elias coming down thence, whither he had ascended, and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> arising from the nether world." This is not to be understood as though the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was reunited to his body, but that his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> appeared through some assumed body, just as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do. But Elias appeared in his own body, not that he was brought down from the empyrean <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, but from some place on high whither he was taken up in the fiery chariot.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says on <a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse3">Matthew 17:3</a>: "<a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elias are brought forward for many reasons." And, first of all, "because the multitude said He was Elias or <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremias</a> or one of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, He brings the leaders of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> with Him; that hereby at least they might see the difference between the servants and their Lord." Another reason was " . . . that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> gave the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> . . . while Elias . . . was jealous for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore by appearing together with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, they show how <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> "accused Him of transgressing the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, and of blasphemously appropriating to Himself the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." A third reason was "to show that He has power of death and life, and that He is the judge of the dead and the living; by bringing with Him <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> who had died, and Elias who still lived." A fourth reason was because, as Luke says (<a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse31">9:31</a>), "they spoke" with Him "of His decease that He should accomplish in Jerusalem," i.e. of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> and death. Therefore, "in order to strengthen the hearts of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> with a view to this," He sets before them those who had exposed themselves to death for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake: since <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> braved death in opposing <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>, and Elias in opposing <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>. A fifth reason was that "He wished His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to imitate the meekness of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the zeal of Elias." <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> adds a sixth reason--namely, in order to signify that He had been foretold by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, which <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> gave them, and by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, of whom Elias was the principal.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Lofty mysteries should not be immediately explained to everyone, but should be handed down through superiors to others in their proper turn. Consequently, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (on <a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse3">Matthew 17:3</a>), "He took these three as being superior to the rest." For "Peter excelled in the love" he bore to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and in the power bestowed on him; John in the privilege of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> love for him on account of his <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, and, again, on account of his being privileged to be an Evangelist; James on account of the privilege of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. Nevertheless He did not wish them to tell others what they had seen before His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>; "lest," as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on <a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse19">Matthew 17:19</a>, "such a wonderful thing should seem incredible to them; and lest, after hearing of so great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, they should be scandalized at the Cross" that followed; or, again, "lest [the Cross] should be entirely hindered by the people" [<a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>, Hom. xviii; cf. Catena Aurea; and "in order that they might then be <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things when they should be filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>" [<a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a>, in Matth. xvii].

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the testimony of the Father's voice, saying, "This is My beloved Son," was fittingly added?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the testimony of the Father's voice, saying, "This is My beloved Son," was not fittingly added; for, as it is written (<a href="../bible/job033.htm#verse14">Job 33:14</a>), "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> speaketh once, and repeateth not the selfsame thing the second time." But the Father's voice had testified to this at the time of (Christ's) <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Therefore it was not fitting that He should bear witness to it a second time.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, at the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> appeared under the form of a dove at the same time as the Father's voice was heard. But this did not happen at the <a href="../cathen/15019a.htm">transfiguration</a>. Therefore it seems that the testimony of the Father was made in an unfitting manner.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> began to teach after His baptism. Nevertheless, the Father's voice did not then command men to hear him. Therefore neither should it have so commanded at the <a href="../cathen/15019a.htm">transfiguration</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, things should not be said to those who cannot bear them, according to <a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse12">John 16:12</a>: "I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now." But the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> could not bear the Father's voice; for it is written (<a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse6">Matthew 17:6</a>) that "the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> hearing, fell upon their face, and were very much afraid." Therefore the Father's voice should not have been addressed to them.

<p><strong>On the contrary</strong> is the authority of the Gospel.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The adoption of the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is through a certain conformity of image to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Now this takes place in two ways: first, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the wayfarer, which is imperfect conformity; secondly, by <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, which is perfect conformity, according to <a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse2">1 John 3:2</a>: "We are now the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and it hath not yet appeared what we shall be: we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that, when He shall appear, we shall be like to Him, because we shall see Him as He is." Since, therefore, it is in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> that we acquire <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, while the clarity of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to come was foreshadowed in the <a href="../cathen/15019a.htm">transfiguration</a>, therefore both in His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and in His <a href="../cathen/15019a.htm">transfiguration</a> the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> sonship of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was fittingly made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the testimony of the Father: because He alone with the Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is perfectly conscious of that perfect generation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The words quoted are to be understood of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> speaking, by which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father uttered the only-begotten and co-eternal Word. Nevertheless, it can be said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> uttered the same thing twice in a bodily voice, yet not for the same purpose, but in order to show the divers modes in which men can be partakers of the likeness of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Sonship.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the first regeneration was proclaimed, the operation of the whole <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> was made manifest, because the Son Incarnate was there, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> appeared under the form of a dove, and the Father made Himself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in the voice; so also in the <a href="../cathen/15019a.htm">transfiguration</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the second regeneration, the whole <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> appears--the Father in the voice, the Son in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> in the bright cloud; for just as in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> He confers innocence, signified by the simplicity of the dove, so in the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> will He give His <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> the clarity of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and refreshment from all sorts of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, which are signified by the bright cloud.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> came to give <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> actually, and to promise <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> by His words. Therefore it was fitting at the time of His <a href="../cathen/15019a.htm">transfiguration</a>, and not at the time of His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, that men should be commanded to hear Him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> It was fitting that the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> should be afraid and fall down on hearing the voice of the Father, to show that the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which was then being revealed surpasses in excellence the sense and faculty of all mortal beings; according to <a href="../bible/exo033.htm#verse20">Exodus 33:20</a>: "Man shall not see Me and live." This is what <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on <a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse6">Matthew 17:6</a>: "Such is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> frailty that it cannot bear to gaze on such great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>." But men are healed of this frailty by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> when He brings them into <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. And this is signified by what He says to them: "Arise, and fear not."
