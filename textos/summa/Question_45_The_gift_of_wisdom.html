<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether wisdom should be reckoned among the gifts of the Holy Ghost?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that wisdom ought not to be reckoned among the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are more perfect than the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as stated above (I-II, 68, 8). Now <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is directed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> alone, wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Lib. Arb. ii, 19) that "no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> makes bad use of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>." Much more therefore are the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> directed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> alone. But wisdom is directed to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> also, for it is written (<a href="../bible/jam003.htm#verse15">James 3:15</a>) that a certain wisdom is "earthly, sensual, devilish." Therefore wisdom should not be reckoned among the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. xii, 14) "wisdom is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Divine things." Now that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Divine things which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can acquire by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> endowments, belongs to the wisdom which is an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Divine things belongs to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as explained above (4, 5; I-II, 62, 3). Therefore wisdom should be called a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> rather than a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/job028.htm#verse28">Job 28:28</a>): "Behold the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, and to depart from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, that is understanding." And in this passage according to the rendering of the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> which <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> follows (De Trin. xii, 14; xiv, 1) we read: "Behold piety, that is wisdom." Now both fear and piety are <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Therefore wisdom should not be reckoned among the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as though it were distinct from the others.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse2">Isaiah 11:2</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> shall rest upon Him; the spirit of wisdom and of understanding."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. i: 2), it belongs to wisdom to consider the highest <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. By means of that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> we are able to form a most certain judgment about other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, and according thereto all things should be set in order. Now the highest <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> may be understood in two ways, either simply or in some particular genus. Accordingly he that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the highest <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> in any particular genus, and by its means is able to judge and set in order all the things that belong to that genus, is said to be wise in that genus, for instance in medicine or <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architecture</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse10">1 Corinthians 3:10</a>: "As a wise architect, I have laid a foundation." On the other hand, he who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that is simply the highest, which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is said to be wise simply, because he is able to judge and set in order all things according to Divine rules.

<p>Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> obtains this judgment through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse15">1 Corinthians 2:15</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> judgeth all things," because as stated in the same chapter (<a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse10">1 Corinthians 2:10</a>), "the Spirit searcheth all things, yea the deep things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Wherefore it is evident that wisdom is a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A thing is said to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in two senses: first in the sense that it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and simply perfect, secondly, by a kind of likeness, being perfect in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; thus we speak of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or a perfect <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> observes (Metaph. v, text. 21). And just as with regard to those things which are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, we find a highest <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, namely the sovereign <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is the last end, by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> which, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is said to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> wise, so too in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things something is to be found to which all others are to be referred as to a last end, by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> which, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is said to be wise unto <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> doing, according to <a href="../bible/jer004.htm#verse22">Jeremiah 4:22</a>: "They are wise to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, but to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> they have no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>." Now whoever turns away from his due end, must needs fix on some undue end, since every agent acts for an end. Wherefore, if he fixes his end in external earthly things, his "wisdom" is called "earthly," if in the goods of the body, it is called "sensual wisdom," if in some excellence, it is called "devilish wisdom" because it imitates the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, of which it is written (<a href="../bible/job041.htm#verse25">Job 41:25</a>): "He is king over all the children of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The wisdom which is called a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, differs from that which is an acquired <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, for the latter is attained by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> effort, whereas the latter is "descending from above" (<a href="../bible/jam003.htm#verse15">James 3:15</a>). On like manner it differs from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, since <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> assents to the Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in itself, whereas it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of wisdom to judge according to the Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of wisdom presupposes <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, because "a man judges well what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>" (Ethic. i, 3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Just as piety which pertains to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a manifestation of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in so far as we make profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by worshipping <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so too, piety manifests wisdom. For this reason piety is stated to be wisdom, and so is fear, for the same reason, because if a man fear and worship <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, this shows that he has a right judgment about Divine things.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether wisdom is in the intellect as its subject?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that wisdom is not in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> as its subject. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. cxx) that "wisdom is the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as its subject, and not in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as stated above (Question 24, Article 1). Therefore wisdom is not in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> as its subject.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/sir006.htm#verse23">Sirach 6:23</a>): "The wisdom of doctrine is according to her name," for wisdom [sapientia] may be described as "sweet-tasting science [sapida scientia]," and this would seem to regard the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, to which it belongs to taste <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> pleasure or sweetness. Therefore wisdom is in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> rather than in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> power is sufficiently perfected by the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding. Now it is superfluous to require two things where one suffices for the purpose. Therefore wisdom is not in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. ii, 49) that "wisdom is contrary to folly." But folly is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore wisdom is also.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), wisdom denotes a certain rectitude of judgment according to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">Eternal</a> Law. Now rectitude of judgment is twofold: first, on account of perfect use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, secondly, on account of a certain connaturality with the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> about which one has to judge. Thus, about matters of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, a man after inquiring with his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> forms a right judgment, if he has learnt the science of morals, while he who has the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> judges of such matters by a kind of connaturality.

<p>Accordingly it belongs to the wisdom that is an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to pronounce right judgment about Divine things after reason has made its inquiry, but it belongs to wisdom as a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> to judge aright about them on account of connaturality with them: thus <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. ii) that "<a href="../cathen/07345b.htm">Hierotheus</a> is perfect in Divine things, for he not only learns, but is patient of, Divine things."

<p>Now this sympathy or connaturality for Divine things is the result of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which unites us to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse17">1 Corinthians 6:17</a>: "He who is joined to the Lord, is one spirit." Consequently wisdom which is a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, has its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, but it has its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, whose act is to judge aright, as stated above (I-II, 14, 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is speaking of wisdom as to its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, whence also wisdom [sapientia] takes its name, in so far as it denotes a certain sweetness [saporem].

<p>Hence the Reply to the Second Objection is evident, that is if this be the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> meaning of the text quoted. For, apparently this is not the case, because such an exposition of the text would only fit the <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> word for wisdom, whereas it does not apply to the Greek and perhaps not in other languages. Hence it would seem that in the text quoted wisdom stands for the renown of doctrine, for which it is praised by all.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> exercises a twofold act, perception and judgment. The <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding regards the former; the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of wisdom regards the latter according to the Divine <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether wisdom is merely speculative, or practical also?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that wisdom is not practical but merely speculative. For the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of wisdom is more excellent than the wisdom which is an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But wisdom, as an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, is merely speculative. Much more therefore is wisdom, as a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, speculative and not practical.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is about matters of operation which are <a href="../cathen/04331a.htm">contingent</a>. But wisdom is about Divine things which are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Therefore wisdom cannot be practical.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. vi, 37) that "in <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> we seek the Beginning which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but in action we labor under a mighty bundle of wants." Now wisdom regards the vision of Divine things, in which there is no toiling under a load, since according to <a href="../bible/wis008.htm#verse16">Wisdom 8:16</a>, "her conversation hath no bitterness, nor her company any tediousness." Therefore wisdom is merely contemplative, and not practical or active.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/col004.htm#verse5">Colossians 4:5</a>): "Walk with wisdom towards them that are without." Now this pertains to action. Therefore wisdom is not merely speculative, but also practical.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xii, 14), the higher part of the reason is the province of wisdom, while the lower part is the domain of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Now the higher reason according to the same authority (De Trin. xii, 7) "is intent on the consideration and consultation of the heavenly," i.e. Divine, "types" [Cf. I, 79, 09; I-II, 74, 7]; it considers them, in so far as it contemplates Divine things in themselves, and it consults them, in so far as it judges of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> by Divine things, and directs <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> according to Divine rules.

<p>Accordingly wisdom as a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, is not merely speculative but also practical.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The higher a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is, the greater the number of things to which it extends, as stated in De Causis, prop. x, xvii. Wherefore from the very fact that wisdom as a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> is more excellent than wisdom as an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since it attains to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more intimately by a kind of union of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with Him, it is able to direct us not only in <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> but also in action.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Divine things are indeed <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> in themselves, yet they are the rules of the contingent things which are the subject-<a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A thing is considered in itself before being compared with something else. Wherefore to wisdom belongs first of all <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> which is the vision of the Beginning, and afterwards the direction of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> according to the Divine rules. Nor from the direction of wisdom does there result any bitterness or toil in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>; on the contrary the result of wisdom is to make the bitter sweet, and labor a rest.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether wisdom can be without grace, and with mortal sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that wisdom can be without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and with mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> chiefly in such things as are incompatible with mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/2co001.htm#verse12">2 Corinthians 1:12</a>: "Our <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is this, the testimony of our <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>." Now one ought not to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in one's wisdom, according to <a href="../bible/jer009.htm#verse23">Jeremiah 9:23</a>: "Let not the wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in his wisdom." Therefore wisdom can be without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and with mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, wisdom denotes <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Divine things, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Now one in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse18">Romans 1:18</a>: "(Those men that) detain the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>." Therefore wisdom is compatible with mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xv, 18) while speaking of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: "Nothing surpasses this <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is this alone that divides the children of the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal kingdom</a> from the children of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> perdition." But wisdom is distinct from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore it does not divide the children of the kingdom from the children of perdition. Therefore it is compatible with mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/wis001.htm#verse4">Wisdom 1:4</a>): "Wisdom will not enter into a malicious <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, nor dwell in a body subject to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The wisdom which is a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), enables us to judge aright of Divine things, or of other things according to Divine rules, by reason of a certain connaturalness or union with Divine things, which is the effect of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as stated above (2; 23, 5). Hence the wisdom of which we are speaking presupposes <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is incompatible with mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as shown above (Question 24, Article 12). Therefore it follows that the wisdom of which we are speaking cannot be together with mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> These words are to be understood as referring to worldly wisdom, or to wisdom in Divine things acquired through <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> reasons. On such wisdom the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> do not <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, according to <a href="../bible/pro030.htm#verse2">Proverbs 30:2</a>: "The wisdom of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> is not with Me": But they do <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in Divine wisdom according to <a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse30">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>: "(Who) of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is made unto us wisdom."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument considers, not the wisdom of which we speak but that which is acquired by the study and research of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, and is compatible with mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although wisdom is distinct from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, it presupposes it, and for that very reason divides the children of perdition from the children of the kingdom.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether wisdom is in all who have grace?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that wisdom is not in all who have <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For it is more to have wisdom than to hear wisdom. Now it is only for the perfect to hear wisdom, according to <a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse6">1 Corinthians 2:6</a>: "We speak wisdom among the perfect." Since then not all who have <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> are perfect, it seems that much less all who have <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> have wisdom.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "The wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> sets things in order," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Metaph. i, 2): and it is written (<a href="../bible/jam003.htm#verse17">James 3:17</a>) that the wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> "judges without dissimulation [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'The wisdom that is from above . . . is . . . without judging, without dissimulation']". Now it is not for all that have <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, to judge, or put others in order, but only for those in authority. Therefore wisdom is not in all that have <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "Wisdom is a remedy against folly," as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. ii, 49). Now many that have <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> foolish, for instance <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madmen</a> who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> or those who without being guilty of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> have become insane. Therefore wisdom is not in all that have <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Whoever is without mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is beloved of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; since he has <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, whereby he loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> loves them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him (<a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse17">Proverbs 8:17</a>). Now it is written (<a href="../bible/wis007.htm#verse28">Wisdom 7:28</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> loveth none but him that dwelleth with wisdom." Therefore wisdom is in all those who have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and are without mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The wisdom of which we are speaking, as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>), denotes a certain rectitude of judgment in the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> and consultation of Divine things, and as to both of these men obtain various degrees of wisdom through union with Divine things. For the measure of right judgment attained by some, whether in the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of Divine things or in directing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs according to Divine rules, is no more than suffices for their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. This measure is wanting to none who is without mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through having <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, since if <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> does not fail in necessaries, much less does <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> fail: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse27">1 John 2:27</a>): "(His) unction teacheth you of all things."

<p>Some, however, receive a higher degree of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of wisdom, both as to the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of Divine things (by both <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> more exalted mysteries and being able to impart this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to others) and as to the direction of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs according to Divine rules (by being able to direct not only themselves but also others according to those rules). This degree of wisdom is not common to all that have <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, but belongs rather to the gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> dispenses as He will, according to <a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse8">1 Corinthians 12:8</a>: "To one indeed by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> is given the word of wisdom," etc.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> speaks there of wisdom, as extending to the hidden mysteries of Divine things, as indeed he says himself (<a href="../bible/2co001.htm#verse7">2 Corinthians 1:7</a>): "We speak the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, a wisdom which is hidden."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although it belongs to those alone who are in authority to direct and judge other men, yet every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is competent to direct and judge his own actions, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> declares (Ep. ad Demophil.).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Baptized idiots, like little children, have the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of wisdom, which is a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, but they have not the act, on account of the bodily impediment which hinders the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> in them.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the seventh beatitude corresponds to the gift of wisdom?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the seventh beatitude does not correspond to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of wisdom. For the seventh beatitude is: "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Now both these things belong to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: since of peace it is written (<a href="../bible/psa118.htm#verse165">Psalm 118:165</a>): "Much peace have they that love Thy <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>," and, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans 5:5</a>), "the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is poured forth in our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> Who is given to us," and Who is "the Spirit of adoption of sons, whereby we cry: <a href="../cathen/01006d.htm">Abba</a> [Father]" (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse15">Romans 8:15</a>). Therefore the seventh beatitude ought to be ascribed to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> rather than to wisdom.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a thing is declared by its proximate effect rather than by its remote effect. Now the proximate effect of wisdom seems to be <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, according to <a href="../bible/wis007.htm#verse27">Wisdom 7:27</a>: "Through nations she conveyeth herself into <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; she maketh the friends of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>": whereas peace and the adoption of sons seem to be remote effects, since they result from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as stated above (Question 29, Article 3). Therefore the beatitude corresponding to wisdom should be determined in respect of the love of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> rather than in respect of peace.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/jam003.htm#verse17">James 3:17</a>): "The wisdom, that is from above, first indeed is chaste, then peaceable, modest, easy to be persuaded, consenting to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, full of mercy and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> fruits, judging without dissimulation [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'without judging, without dissimulation']." Therefore the beatitude corresponding to wisdom should not refer to peace rather than to the other effects of heavenly wisdom.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 4) that "wisdom is becoming to peacemakers, in whom there is no movement of rebellion, but only obedience to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The seventh beatitude is fittingly ascribed to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of wisdom, both as to the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> and as to the reward. The <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> is denoted in the words, "Blessed are the peacemakers." Now a peacemaker is one who makes peace, either in himself, or in others: and in both cases this is the result of setting in due order those things in which peace is established, for "peace is the tranquillity of order," according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei xix, 13). Now it belongs to wisdom to set things in order, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> declares (Metaph. i, 2), wherefore peaceableness is fittingly ascribed to wisdom. The reward is expressed in the words, "they shall be called the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are called the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in so far as they participate in the likeness of the only-begotten and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse29">Romans 8:29</a>, "Whom He foreknew . . . to be made conformable to the image of His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>," Who is Wisdom Begotten. Hence by participating in the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of wisdom, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> attains to the sonship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It belongs to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> to be at peace, but it belongs to wisdom to make peace by setting things in order. Likewise the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is called the "Spirit of adoption" in so far as we receive from Him the likeness of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> Son, Who is the Begotten Wisdom.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> These words refer to the Uncreated Wisdom, which in the first place unites itself to us by the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and consequently reveals to us the mysteries the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of which is infused wisdom. Hence, the infused wisdom which is a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> but the effect of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>) it belongs to wisdom, as a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, not only to contemplate Divine things, but also to regulate <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>. Now the first thing, to be effected in this direction of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> is the removal of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> opposed to wisdom: wherefore fear is said to be "the beginning of wisdom," because it makes us shun <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, while the last thing is like an end, whereby all things are reduced to their right order; and it is this that constitutes peace. Hence James said with reason that "the wisdom that is from above" (and this is the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>) "first indeed is chaste," because it avoids the corruption of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and "then peaceable," wherein lies the ultimate effect of wisdom, for which reason peace is numbered among the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a>. As to the things that follow, they declare in becoming order the means whereby wisdom leads to peace. For when a man, by <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, avoids the corruption of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the first thing he has to do is, as far as he can, to be moderate in all things, and in this respect wisdom is said to be modest. Secondly, in those matters in which he is not sufficient by himself, he should be guided by the advice of others, and as to this we are told further that wisdom is "easy to be persuaded." These two are <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> required that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may be at peace with himself. But in order that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may be at peace with others it is furthermore required, first that he should not be opposed to their <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; this is what is meant by "consenting to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." Secondly, that he should bring to his neighbor's deficiencies, sympathy in his heart, and succor in his actions, and this is denoted by the words "full of mercy and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> fruits." Thirdly, he should strive in all <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> to correct the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of others, and this is indicated by the words "judging without dissimulation [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'The wisdom that is from above . . . is . . . without judging, without dissimulation']," lest he should purpose to sate his <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> under cover of correction.
