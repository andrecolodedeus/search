<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether anger is a special passion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is not a special passion. For the irascible power takes its name from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> [ira]. But there are several <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> in this power, not only one. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is not one special passion.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to every special passion there is a contrary passion; as is evident by going through them one by one. But no passion is contrary to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, as stated above (Question 23, Article 3). Therefore <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is not a special passion.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, one special passion does not include another. But <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> includes several <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>: since it accompanies sorrow, pleasure, and hope, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Rhet. ii, 2). Therefore <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is not a special passion.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. ii, 16) calls <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> a special passion: and so does Cicero (De Quaest. Tusc. iv, 7).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing is said to be general in two ways. First, by predication; thus "animal" is general in respect of all animals. Secondly, by <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>; thus the sun is the general <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all things generated here below, according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. iv). Because just as a genus contains <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a> many differences, according to a likeness of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; so an efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> contains many effects according to its active power. Now it happens that an effect is produced by the concurrence of various <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>; and since every <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> remains somewhat in its effect, we may say that, in yet a third way, an effect which is due to the concurrence of several <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, has a certain generality, inasmuch as several <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> are, in a fashion, actually <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> therein.

<p>Accordingly in the first way, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is not a general passion but is condivided with the other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, as stated above (Question 23, Article 4). In like manner, neither is it in the second way: since it is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. But in this way, love may be called a general passion, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> declares (De Civ. Dei xiv, 7,9), because love is the primary root of all the other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, as stated above (Question 27, Article 4). But, in a third way, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> may be called a general passion, inasmuch as it is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by a concurrence of several <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Because the movement of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> does not arise save on account of some pain inflicted, and unless there be desire and hope of revenge: for, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 2), "the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hopes to punish; since he craves for revenge as being possible." Consequently if the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, who inflicted the injury, excel very much, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> does not ensue, but only sorrow, as <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a> states (De Anima iv, 6).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The irascible power takes its name from "ira" [<a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>], not because every movement of that power is one of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; but because all its movements terminate in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; and because, of all these movements, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is the most patent.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> From the very fact that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by contrary <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, i.e. by hope, which is of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and by sorrow, which is of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, it includes in itself contrariety: and consequently it has no contrary outside itself. Thus also in mixed colors there is no contrariety, except that of the simple colors from which they are made.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Anger includes several <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, not indeed as a genus includes several <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; but rather according to the inclusion of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and effect.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the object of anger is good or evil?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the object of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> says [Nemesius, De Nat. Hom. xxi.] that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is "the sword-bearer of desire," inasmuch, to wit, as it assails whatever obstacle stands in the way of desire. But an obstacle has the character of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> regards <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as its object.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> agree in their effect, since each seeks to inflict harm on another. But <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> regards <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as its object, as stated above (Question 29, Article 1). Therefore <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> does also.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> arises from sorrow; wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. viii, 6) that "<a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> acts with sorrow." But <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is the object of sorrow. Therefore it is also the object of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. ii, 6) that "<a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> craves for revenge." But the desire for revenge is a desire for something <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: since revenge belongs to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Therefore the object of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p>Moreover, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is always accompanied by hope, wherefore it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> pleasure, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 2). But the object of hope and of pleasure is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is also the object of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power follows an act of the apprehensive power. Now the apprehensive power apprehends a thing in two ways. First, by way of an incomplex object, as when we understand what a man is; secondly, by way of a complex object, as when we understand that whiteness is in a man. Consequently in each of these ways the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power can tend to both <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: by way of a simple and incomplex object, when the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> simply follows and adheres to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, or recoils from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: and such movements are desire, hope, pleasure, sorrow, and so forth: by way of a complex object, as when the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is concerned with some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> being in, or being done to, another, either seeking this or recoiling from it. This is evident in the case of love and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>: for we love someone, in so far as we wish some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to be in him; and we <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> someone, in so far as we wish some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to be in him. It is the same with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; for when a man is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, he wishes to be avenged on someone. Hence the movement of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> has a twofold tendency: viz. to vengeance itself, which it desires and hopes for as being a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, wherefore it takes pleasure in it; and to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> on whom it seeks vengeance, as to something contrary and hurtful, which bears the character of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p>We must, however, observe a twofold difference in this respect, between <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> on the one side, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> and love on the other. The first difference is that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> always regards two objects: whereas love and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> sometimes regard but one object, as when a man is said to love wine or something of the kind, or to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> it. The second difference is, that both the objects of love are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: since the lover wishes <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to someone, as to something agreeable to himself: while both the objects of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> bear the character of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a>, wishes <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to someone, as to something disagreeable to him. Whereas <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> regards one object under the aspect of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, viz. the noxious <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, on whom it seeks to be avenged. Consequently it is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> somewhat made up of contrary <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether anger is in the concupiscible faculty?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty. For Cicero says (De Quaest. Tusc. iv, 9) that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is a kind of "desire." But desire is in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is too.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in his Rule, that "<a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> grows into <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>": and Cicero says (De Quaest. Tusc. iv, 9) that "<a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is inveterate <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>." But <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, like love, is a <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> passion. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. ii, 16) and <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> [Nemesius, De Nat. Hom. xxi.] say that "<a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is made up of sorrow and desire." Both of these are in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is a <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> passion.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> is distinct from the irascible faculty. If, therefore, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> were in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> power, the irascible would not take its name from it.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 23, Article 1), the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the irascible part differ from the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty, in that the objects of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> absolutely considered, whereas the objects of the irascible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in a certain elevation or arduousness. Now it has been stated (2) that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> regards two objects: viz. the vengeance that it seeks; and the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> on whom it seeks vengeance; and in respect of both, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> requires a certain arduousness: for the movement of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> does not arise, unless there be some magnitude about both these objects; since "we make no ado about things that are naught or very minute," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> observes (Rhet. ii, 2). It is therefore evident that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is not in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>, but in the irascible faculty.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Cicero gives the name of desire to any kind of craving for a future <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, without discriminating between that which is arduous and that which is not. Accordingly he reckons <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> as a kind of desire, inasmuch as it is a desire of vengeance. In this sense, however, desire is common to the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculties.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Anger is said to grow into <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, not as though the same passion which at first was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, afterwards becomes <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> by becoming inveterate; but by a process of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>. For <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> when it lasts a long time engenders <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Anger is said to be composed of sorrow and desire, not as though they were its parts, but because they are its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>: and it has been said above (Question 25, Article 2) that the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of the irascible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether anger requires an act of reason?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> does not require an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. For, since <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, it is in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. But the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> follows an apprehension, not of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, but of the sensitive faculty. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> does not require an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, dumb animals are devoid of reason: and yet they are seen to be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> does not require an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, drunkenness fetters the reason; whereas it is conducive to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> does not require an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 6) that "<a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> listens to reason somewhat."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is a desire for vengeance. Now vengeance implies a comparison between the punishment to be inflicted and the hurt done; wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 6) that "<a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, as if it had drawn the inference that it ought to quarrel with such a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, is therefore immediately exasperated." Now to compare and to draw an inference is an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, in a fashion, requires an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power may follow an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> in two ways. In the first way, it follows the reason in so far as the reason commands: and thus the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> follows reason, wherefore it is called the rational <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. In another way, it follows reason in so far as the reason denounces, and thus <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> follows reason. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Problem. xxviii, 3) that "<a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> follows reason, not in obedience to reason's command, but as a result of reason's denouncing the injury." Because the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is subject to the reason, not immediately but through the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Dumb animals have a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> instinct imparted to them by the Divine <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason</a>, in virtue of which they are gifted with movements, both internal and external, like unto rational movements, as stated above (Question 40, Article 3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated in Ethic. vii, 6, "<a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> listens somewhat to reason" in so far as reason denounces the injury inflicted, "but listens not perfectly," because it does not observe the rule of reason as to the measure of vengeance. Anger, therefore, requires an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>; and yet proves a hindrance to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Problem. iii, 2,27) that whose who are very drunk, so as to be incapable of the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, do not get <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>: but those who are slightly drunk, do get <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, through being still able, though hampered, to form a judgment of reason.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether anger is more natural than desire?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is not more <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> than desire. Because it is proper to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> a gentle animal. But "gentleness is contrary to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Rhet. ii, 3). Therefore <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is no more <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> than desire, in fact it seems to be altogether unnatural to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, reason is contrasted with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: since those things that act according to reason, are not said to act according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now "<a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> requires an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, but desire does not," as stated in Ethic. vii, 6. Therefore desire is more <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> than <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is a craving for vengeance: while desire is a craving for those things especially which are pleasant to the touch, viz. for pleasures of the table and for sexual pleasures. But these things are more <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> than vengeance. Therefore desire is more <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> than <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 6) that "<a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is more <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> than desire."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> By "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>" we mean that which is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as stated in Phys. ii, 1. Consequently the question as to whether a particular passion is more or less <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> cannot be decided without reference to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of that passion. Now the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, as stated above (Question 36, Article 2), may be considered in two ways: first, on the part of the object; secondly, on the part of the subject. If then we consider the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and of desire, on the part of the object, thus desire, especially of pleasures of the table, and of sexual pleasures, is more <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> than <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; in so far as these pleasures are more <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> than vengeance.

<p>If, however, we consider the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> on the part of the subject, thus <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, in a manner, is more <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>; and, in a manner, desire is more <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>. Because the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may be considered either as to the generic, or as to the specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, or again as to the particular temperament of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. If then we consider the generic <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> considered as an animal; thus desire is more <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> than <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; because it is from this very generic <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is inclined to desire those things which tend to preserve in him the life both of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. If, however, we consider the specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as a rational being; then <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is more <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> than desire, in so far as <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> follows reason more than desire does. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 5) that "revenge" which pertains to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> "is more <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> than meekness": for it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to everything to rise up against things contrary and hurtful. And if we consider the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, in respect of his particular temperament, thus <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is more <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> than desire; for the reason that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is prone to ensue from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> tendency to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, more than desire, or any other passion, is to ensue from a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> tendency to desire, which tendencies result from a man's <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> temperament. Because disposition to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is due to a bilious temperament; and of all the humors, the bile moves quickest; for it is like fire. Consequently he that is temperamentally disposed to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is sooner <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incensed</a> with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, than he that is temperamentally disposed to desire, is inflamed with desire: and for this reason the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 6) that a disposition to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is more liable to be transmitted from parent to child, than a disposition to desire.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> We may consider in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> both the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> temperament on the part of the body, and the reason. On the part of the bodily temperament, a man, considered specifically, does not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> excel others either in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> or in any other passion, on account of the moderation of his temperament. But other animals, for as much as their temperament recedes from this moderation and approaches to an extreme disposition, are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> disposed to some excess of passion, such as the lion in daring, the hound in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, the hare in fear, and so forth. On the part of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, however, it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, both to be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> and to be gentle: in so far as reason somewhat <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, by denouncing the injury which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; and somewhat appeases <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, in so far as the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> "does not listen perfectly to the command of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>," as stated above (4, ad 3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason</a> itself belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: wherefore from the very fact that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> requires an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, it follows that it is, in a manner, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument regards <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and desire on the part of the object.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether anger is more grievous than hatred?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is more grievous than <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/pro027.htm#verse4">Proverbs 27:4</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> hath no mercy, nor fury when it breaketh forth." But <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> sometimes has mercy. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is more grievous than <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is worse to suffer <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and to grieve for it, than merely to suffer it. But when a man <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a>, he is contented if the object of his <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> suffer <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: whereas the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not satisfied unless the object of his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it and be aggrieved thereby, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 4). Therefore, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is more grievous than <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a thing seems to be so much the more firm according as more things concur to set it up: thus a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is all the more settled through being <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by several acts. But <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the concurrence of several <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>): whereas <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is not. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is more settled and more grievous than <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, in his Rule, compares <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> to "a beam," but <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> to "a mote."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> are taken from its object. Now the object of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is the same in <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> as the object of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>; since, just as the hater wishes <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to him whom he <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a>, so does the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> wish <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to him with whom he is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>. But there is a difference of aspect: for the hater wishes <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to his enemy, as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, whereas the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> wishes <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to him with whom he is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, not as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> but in so far as it has an aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, that is, in so far as he reckons it as <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, since it is a means of vengeance. Wherefore also it has been said above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>) that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> implies application of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, whereas <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> denotes application of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Now it is evident that to seek <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> under the aspect of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, is a lesser <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, than simply to seek <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to someone. Because to wish <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to someone under the aspect of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, may be according to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, if it be in conformity with the order of reason; and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> fails only in this, that it does not obey the precept of reason in taking vengeance. Consequently it is evident that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is far worse and graver than <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> two points may be considered: namely, the thing desired, and the intensity of the desire. As to the thing desired, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> has more mercy than <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> has. For since <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> desires another's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil's</a> sake, it is satisfied with no particular measure of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: because those things that are desired for their own sake, are desired without measure, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Polit. i, 3), instancing a miser with regard to <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/sir012.htm#verse16">Sirach 12:16</a>): "An enemy . . . if he find an opportunity, will not be satisfied with blood." Anger, on the other hand, seeks <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> only under the aspect of a just means of vengeance. Consequently when the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> inflicted goes beyond the measure of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> according to the estimate of the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, then he has mercy. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 4) that "the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is appeased if many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> befall, whereas the hater is never appeased."

<p>As to the intensity of the desire, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> excludes mercy more than <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> does; because the movement of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is more impetuous, through the heating of the bile. Hence the passage quoted continues: "Who can bear the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of one provoked?"

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above, an <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> wishes <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to someone, in so far as this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is a means of just vengeance. Now vengeance is wrought by the infliction of a punishment: and the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of punishment consists in being contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, painful, and inflicted for some fault. Consequently an <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> desires this, that the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> whom he is hurting, may feel it and be in pain, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this has befallen him on account of the harm he has done the other. The hater, on the other hand, cares not for all this, since he desires another's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as such. It is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, however, that an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is worse through giving pain: because "<a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> and imprudence, although <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>," yet, being <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, "do not grieve those in whom they are," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> observes (Rhet. ii, 4).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> That which proceeds from several <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, is more settled when these <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> are of one kind: but it may be that one <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> prevails over many others. Now <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> ensues from a more lasting <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> than <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> does. Because <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> arises from an emotion of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> due to the wrong inflicted; whereas <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> ensues from a disposition in a man, by reason of which he considers that which he <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> to be contrary and hurtful to him. Consequently, as passion is more transitory than disposition or <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, so <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is less lasting than <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>; although <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> itself is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> ensuing from this disposition. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 4) that "<a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is more incurable than <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>."

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether anger is only towards those to whom one has an obligation of justice?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is not only towards those to whom one has an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. For there is no <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> between <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and irrational beings. And yet sometimes one is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with irrational beings; thus, out of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, a writer throws away his pen, or a rider strikes his horse. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is not only towards those to whom one has an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "there is no <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> towards oneself . . . nor is there <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> towards one's own" (Ethic. v, 6). But sometimes a man is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with himself; for instance, a penitent, on account of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; hence it is written (<a href="../bible/psa004.htm#verse5">Psalm 4:5</a>): "Be ye <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not." Therefore <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is not only towards those with whom one has a relation of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> can be of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> towards an entire class, or a whole community: for instance, when the state injures an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. But <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is not towards a class but only towards an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Rhet. ii, 4). Therefore properly speaking, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is not towards those with whom one is in relation of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> or <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>.

<p>The contrary, however, may be gathered from the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Rhet. ii, 2,3).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#6">Article 6</a>), <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> desires <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as being a means of just vengeance. Consequently, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is towards those to whom we are just or <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>: since vengeance is an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and wrong-doing is an act of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>. Therefore both on the part of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, viz. the harm done by another, and on the part of the vengeance sought by the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, it is evident that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> concerns those to whom one is just or <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (4, ad 2), <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, though it follows an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, can nevertheless be in dumb animals that are devoid of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, in so far as through their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> instinct they are moved by their <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> to something like rational action. Since then in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> there is both reason and <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, the movement of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> can be aroused in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in two ways. First, when only his <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> denounces the injury: and, in this way, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is aroused to a movement of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> even against irrational and inanimate beings, which movement is like that which occurs in animals against anything that injures them. Secondly, by the reason denouncing the injury: and thus, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Rhet. ii, 3), "it is impossible to be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with insensible things, or with the dead": both because they feel no pain, which is, above all, what the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> seeks in those with whom he is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>: and because there is no question of vengeance on them, since they can do us no harm.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. v, 11), "metaphorically speaking there is a certain <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> between a man and himself," in so far as the reason rules the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And in this sense a man is said to be avenged on himself, and consequently, to be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with himself. But properly, and in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of things, a man is never <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with himself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Rhet. ii, 4) assigns as one difference between <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, that "<a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> may be felt towards a class, as we <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the entire class of thieves; whereas <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is directed only towards an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>." The reason is that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> arises from our considering a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> as disagreeing with our disposition; and this may refer to a thing in general or in particular. Anger, on the other hand, ensues from someone having injured us by his action. Now all actions are the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>: and consequently <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is always pointed at an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. When the whole state hurts us, the whole state is reckoned as one <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> [Cf. 29, 6].

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether the species of anger are suitably assigned?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. ii, 16) unsuitably assigns three <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>--"wrath," "ill-will" and "rancor." For no genus derives its specific differences from <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>. But these three are diversified in respect of an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>: because "the beginning of the movement of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is called wrath <em>cholos</em>, if <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> continue it is called ill-will <em>menis</em>; while rancor <em>kotos</em> is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> waiting for an opportunity of vengeance." Therefore these are not different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, Cicero says (De Quaest. Tusc. iv, 9) that "excandescentia [irascibility] is what the Greeks call <em>thymosis</em>, and is a kind of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> that arises and subsides intermittently"; while according to <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> <em>thymosis</em>, is the same as the Greek <em>kotos</em> [rancor]. Therefore <em>kotos</em> does not bide its time for taking vengeance, but in course of time spends itself.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxi, 4) gives three degrees of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, namely, "<a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> without utterance, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> with utterance, and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> with perfection of speech," corresponding to the three degrees mentioned by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse22">Matthew 5:22</a>): "Whosoever is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with his brother" [thus implying "<a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> without utterance"], and then, "whosoever shall say to his brother, 'Raca'" [implying "<a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> with utterance yet without full expression"], and lastly, "whosoever shall say 'Thou fool'" [where we have "perfection of speech"]. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene's</a> division is imperfect, since it takes no account of utterance.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> stands the authority of <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. ii, 16) and <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> [Nemesius, De Nat. Hom. xxi.].

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> given by <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> and <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> are taken from those things which give increase to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. This happens in three ways. First from facility of the movement itself, and he calls this kind of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> <em>cholos</em> [bile] because it quickly aroused. Secondly, on the part of the grief that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and which dwells some time in the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>; this belongs to <em>menis</em> [ill-will] which is derived from <em>menein</em> [to dwell]. Thirdly, on the part of that which the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> seeks, viz. vengeance; and this pertains to <em>kotos</em> [rancor] which never rests until it is avenged [<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse31">Ephesians 4:31</a>: "Let all bitterness and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and indignation . . . be put away from you."]. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iv, 5) calls some <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> <em>akrocholoi</em> [choleric], because they are easily angered; some he calls <em>pikroi</em> [bitter], because they retain their <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> for a long time; and some he calls <em>chalepoi</em> [ill-tempered], because they never rest until they have retaliated [Cf. II-II, 158, 5].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> All those things which give <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> some kind of perfection are not altogether <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; and consequently nothing prevents them from <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> a certain specific difference thereof.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Irascibility, which Cicero mentions, seems to pertain to the first <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, which consists in a certain quickness of temper, rather than to rancor [furor]. And there is no reason why the Greek <em>thymosis</em>, which is denoted by the <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> "furor," should not signify both quickness to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and firmness of purpose in being avenged.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> These degrees are distinguished according to various effects of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; and not according to degrees of perfection in the very movement of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.
