<h1>Question 46. Folly which is opposed to wisdom</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3046.htm#article1"> Is folly contrary to wisdom?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3046.htm#article2"> Is folly a sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3046.htm#article3"> To which capital sin is it reducible?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether folly is contrary to wisdom?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that folly is not contrary to wisdom. For seemingly unwisdom is directly opposed to wisdom. But folly does not seem to be the same as unwisdom, for the latter is apparently about Divine things alone, whereas folly is about both Divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> things. Therefore folly is not contrary to wisdom.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, one contrary is not the way to arrive at the other. But folly is the way to arrive at wisdom, for it is written (<a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse18">1 Corinthians 3:18</a>): "If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> among you seem to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise." Therefore folly is not opposed to wisdom.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, one contrary is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the other. But wisdom is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of folly; for it is written (<a href="../bible/jer010.htm#verse14">Jeremiah 10:14</a>): "Every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is become a fool for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>," and wisdom is a kind of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Moreover, it is written (<a href="../bible/isa047.htm#verse10">Isaiah 47:10</a>): "Thy wisdom and thy <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, this hath deceived thee." Now it belongs to folly to be deceived. Therefore folly is not contrary to wisdom.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. x, under the letter S) that "a fool is one whom shame does not incite to sorrow, and who is unconcerned when he is injured." But this pertains to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> wisdom, according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. x, 49). Therefore folly is not opposed to wisdom.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. ii, 26) that "the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of wisdom is given as a remedy against folly."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Stultitia [Folly] seems to take its name from "stupor"; wherefore <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. x, under the letter of S): "A fool is one who through dullness [stuporem] remains unmoved." And folly differs from fatuity, according to the same authority (Etym. x), in that folly implies apathy in the heart and dullness in the senses, while fatuity denotes entire privation of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> sense. Therefore folly is fittingly opposed to wisdom.

<p>For "sapiens" [wise] as <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. x) "is so named from sapor [savor], because just as the taste is quick to distinguish between savors of meats, so is a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in discerning things and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>." Wherefore it is manifest that "folly" is opposed to "wisdom" as its contrary, while "fatuity" is opposed to it as a pure negation: since the fatuous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> lacks the sense of judgment, while the fool has the sense, though dulled, whereas the wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has the sense acute and penetrating.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> (Etym. x), "unwisdom is contrary to wisdom because it lacks the savor of discretion and sense"; so that unwisdom is seemingly the same as folly. Yet a man would appear to be a fool chiefly through some deficiency in the verdict of that judgment, which is according to the highest <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, for if a man fails in judgment about some trivial <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, he is not for that reason called a fool.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as there is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> wisdom, as stated above (45, 1, ad 1), called "worldly wisdom," because it takes for the highest <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and last end some worldly <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, so too there is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> folly opposed to this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> wisdom, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> despises worldly things: and it is of this folly that the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> speaks.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is the wisdom of the world that deceives and makes us foolish in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sight, as is evident from the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle's</a> words (<a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse19">1 Corinthians 3:19</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> To be unconcerned when one is injured is sometimes due to the fact that one has no taste for worldly things, but only for heavenly things. Hence this belongs not to worldly but to Divine wisdom, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> declares (Moral. x, 49). Sometimes however it is the result of a man's being simply stupid about everything, as may be seen in idiots, who do not discern what is injurious to them, and this belongs to folly simply.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether folly is a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that folly is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> arises in us from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But some are fools <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>. Therefore folly is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "Every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>," according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Vera Relig. xiv). But folly is not <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. Therefore it is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is contrary to a Divine precept. But folly is not contrary to any precept. Therefore folly is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/pro001.htm#verse32">Proverbs 1:32</a>): "The prosperity of fools shall destroy them." But no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is destroyed save for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore folly is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Folly, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), denotes dullness of sense in judging, and chiefly as regards the highest <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, which is the last end and the sovereign <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now a man may in this respect contract dullness in judgment in two ways. First, from a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> indisposition, as in the case of idiots, and such like folly is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Secondly, by plunging his sense into earthly things, whereby his sense is rendered incapable of perceiving Divine things, according to <a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse14">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>, "The sensual <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> perceiveth not these things that are of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>," even as sweet things have no savor for a man whose taste is infected with an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> humor: and such like folly is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Though no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> wishes to be a fool, yet he wishes those things of which folly is a consequence, viz. to withdraw his sense from <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things and to plunge it into earthly things. The same thing happens in regard to other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; for the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lustful</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> desires pleasure, without which there is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, although he does not desire <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> simply, for he would wish to enjoy the pleasure without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Folly is opposed to the precepts about the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, of which we have spoken above (<a href="#16">Article 16</a>) when we were treating of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and understanding.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether folly is a daughter of lust?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that folly is not a daughter of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi, 45) enumerates the daughters of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, among which however he makes no mention of folly. Therefore folly does not proceed from <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse19">1 Corinthians 3:19</a>): "The wisdom of this world is foolishness with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Now, according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. x, 29) "the wisdom of this world consists in covering the heart with crafty devices;" and this savors of duplicity. Therefore folly is a daughter of duplicity rather than of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> especially is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of fury and <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> in some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; and this pertains to folly. Therefore folly arises from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> rather than from <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/pro007.htm#verse22">Proverbs 7:22</a>): "Immediately he followeth her," i.e. the harlot . . . "not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that he is drawn like a fool to bonds."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As already stated (2), folly, in so far as it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> sense being dulled, so as to be incapable of judging <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> sense is plunged into earthly things chiefly by <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, which is about the greatest of pleasures; and these absorb the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> more than any others. Therefore the folly which is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, arises chiefly from <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is part of folly that a man should have a distaste for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> mentions two daughters of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, pertaining to folly, namely, "<a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" and "<a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> of the life to come"; thus he divides folly into two parts as it were.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> These words of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> are to be understood, not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causally</a> but <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, because, to wit, worldly wisdom itself is folly with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence it does not follow that whatever belongs to worldly wisdom, is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of this folly.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Anger by reason of its keenness, as stated above (I-II, 48, 2,3,4), produces a great change in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the body, wherefore it conduces very much to the folly which results from a bodily impediment. On the other hand the folly which is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> impediment, viz. by the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> being plunged into earthly things, arises chiefly from <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, as stated above.
