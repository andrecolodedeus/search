<h1>Question 46. The beginning of the duration of creatures</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1046.htm#article1"> Have creatures always existed?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1046.htm#article2"> Is it an article of Faith that they began to exist?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1046.htm#article3"> How is God said to have created heaven and earth in the beginning?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the universe of creatures always existed?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> of creatures, called the world, had no beginning, but <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. For everything which begins to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, is a possible being before it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>: otherwise it would be impossible for it to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>. If therefore the world began to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, it was a possible being before it began to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>. But possible being is <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, which is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, which results from a form, and to non-existence, which results from privation of form. If therefore the world began to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> must have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> before the world. But <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> without form: while the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the world with its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> is the world. Therefore the world <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> before it began to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>: which is impossible.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, nothing which has power to be always, sometimes is and sometimes is not; because so far as the power of a thing extends so long is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>. But every incorruptible thing has power to be always; for its power does not extend to any determinate time. Therefore no incorruptible thing sometimes is, and sometimes is not: but everything which has a beginning at some time is, and at some time is not; therefore no incorruptible thing begins to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>. But there are many incorruptible things in the world, as the celestial bodies and all <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. Therefore the world did not begin to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, what is unbegotten has no beginning. But the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Phys. i, text 82) proves that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is unbegotten, and also (De Coelo et Mundo i, text 20) that the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is unbegotten. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> did not begin to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, a vacuum is where there is not a body, but there might be. But if the world began to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, there was first no body where the body of the world now is; and yet it could be there, otherwise it would not be there now. Therefore before the world there was a vacuum; which is impossible.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, nothing begins anew to be moved except through either the mover or the thing moved being otherwise than it was before. But what is otherwise now than it was before, is moved. Therefore before every new movement there was a previous movement. Therefore movement always was; and therefore also the thing moved always was, because movement is only in a movable thing.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, every mover is either <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> or <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. But neither begins to move except by some pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> movement. For <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> always moves in the same manner: hence unless some change precede either in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the mover, or in the movable thing, there cannot arise from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> mover a movement which was not there before. And the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, without itself being changed, puts off doing what it proposes to do; but this can be only by some <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagined</a> change, at least on the part of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Thus he who wills to make a house tomorrow, and not today, awaits something which will be tomorrow, but is not today; and at least awaits for today to pass, and for tomorrow to come; and this cannot be without change, because time is the measure of movement. Therefore it remains that before every new movement, there was a previous movement; and so the same conclusion follows as before.

<p><strong>Objection 7.</strong> Further, whatever is always in its beginning, and always in its end, cannot cease and cannot begin; because what begins is not in its end, and what ceases is not in its beginning. But time always is in its beginning and end, because there is no time except "now" which is the end of the past and the beginning of the future. Therefore time cannot begin or end, and consequently neither can movement, the measure of what is time.

<p><strong>Objection 8.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is before the world either in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> only, or also by duration. If in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> only, therefore, since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, the world also is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. But if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is prior by duration; since what is prior and posterior in duration constitutes time, it follows that time <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> before the world, which is impossible.

<p><strong>Objection 9.</strong> Further, if there is a sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, there is an effect; for a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to which there is no effect is an imperfect <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, requiring something else to make the effect follow. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the world; being the final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, by reason of His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, the exemplar <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> by reason of His wisdom, and the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, by reason of His power as appears from the above (44, 2,3,4). Since therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, the world is also <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 10.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> action postulates an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> effect. But the action of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is His <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. Therefore the world is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse5">John 17:5</a>), "Glorify Me, O Father, with Thyself with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which I had before the world was"; and (<a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse22">Proverbs 8:22</a>), "The Lord possessed Me in the beginning of His ways, before He made anything from the beginning."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Nothing except <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. And this statement is far from impossible to uphold: for it has been shown above (Question 19, Article 4) that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of things. Therefore things are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, according as it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to will them, since the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of the effect depends on the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> (Metaph. v, text 6). Now it was shown above (Question 19, Article 3), that, absolutely speaking, it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should will anything except Himself. It is not therefore <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to will that the world should always <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>; but the world <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> forasmuch as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills it to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, since the being of the world depends on the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as on its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. It is not therefore <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the world to be always; and hence it cannot be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by demonstration.

<p>Nor are <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> reasons (Phys. viii) simply, but relatively, demonstrative--viz. in order to contradict the reasons of some of the ancients who asserted that the world began to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in some quite impossible manner. This appears in three ways.

<p>Firstly, because, both in Phys. viii and in De Coelo i, text 101, he premises some opinions, as those of Anaxagoras, Empedocles and <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, and brings forward reasons to refute them.

<p>Secondly, because wherever he speaks of this subject, he quotes the testimony of the ancients, which is not the way of a demonstrator, but of one persuading of what is probable.

<p>Thirdly, because he expressly says (Topic. i, 9), that there are dialectical problems, about which we have nothing to say from <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, as, "whether the world is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Before the world <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> it was possible for the world to be, not, indeed, according to a passive power which is <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but according to the active power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and also, according as a thing is called absolutely possible, not in relation to any power, but from the sole habitude of the terms which are not repugnant to each other; in which sense possible is opposed to impossible, as appears from the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. v, text 17).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Whatever has power always to be, from the fact of having that power, cannot sometimes be and sometimes not be; but before it received that power, it did not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>.

<p>Hence this reason which is given by <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> (De Coelo i, text 120) does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> simply that incorruptible things never began to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>; but that they did not begin by the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> mode whereby things generated and corruptible begin.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> (Phys. i, text 82) proves that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is unbegotten from the fact that it has not a subject from which to derive its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; and (De Coelo et Mundo i, text 20) he proves that <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is ungenerated, forasmuch as it has no contrary from which to be generated. Hence it appears that no conclusion follows either way, except that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> did not begin by generation, as some said, especially about <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. But we say that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> were produced into being by creation, as appears above (44, 1, ad 2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The notion of a vacuum is not only "in which is nothing," but also implies a space capable of holding a body and in which there is not a body, as appears from <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> (Phys. iv, text 60). Whereas we hold that there was no place or space before the world was.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The first mover was always in the same state: but the first movable thing was not always so, because it began to be whereas hitherto it was not. This, however, was not through change, but by creation, which is not change, as said above (45, 2, as 2). Hence it is evident that this reason, which <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> gives (Phys. viii), is valid against those who admitted the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> movable things, but not <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> movement, as appears from the opinions of Anaxagoras and Empedocles. But we hold that from the moment that movable things began to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> movement also <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> The first agent is a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> agent. And although He had the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> will to produce some effect, yet He did not produce an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> effect. Nor is it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for some change to be presupposed, not even on account of <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> time. For we must take into consideration the difference between a particular agent, that presupposes something and produces something else, and the universal agent, who produces the whole. The particular agent produces the form, and presupposes the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; and hence it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that it introduce the form in due proportion into a suitable <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Hence it is correct to say that it introduces the form into such <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and not into another, on account of the different kinds of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But it is not correct to say so of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who produces form and <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> together: whereas it is correct to say of Him that He produces <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> fitting to the form and to the end. Now, a particular agent presupposes time just as it presupposes <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Hence it is correctly described as acting in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> "after" and not in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> "before," according to an <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> succession of time after time. But the universal agent who produces the thing and time also, is not correctly described as acting now, and not before, according to an <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> succession of time succeeding time, as if time were presupposed to His action; but He must be considered as giving time to His effect as much as and when He willed, and according to what was fitting to demonstrate His power. For the world leads more evidently to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the divine creating power, if it was not always, than if it had always been; since everything which was not always manifestly has a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; whereas this is not so manifest of what always was.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 7.</strong> As is stated (Phys. iv, text 99), "before" and "after" belong to time, according as they are in movement. Hence beginning and end in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> must be taken in the same way as in movement. Now, granted the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of movement, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that any given moment in movement be a beginning and an end of movement; which need not be if movement be a beginning. The same applies to the "now" of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Thus it appears that the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the instant "now," as being always the beginning and end of time, presupposes the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of time and movement. Hence <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> brings forward this reason (Phys. viii, text 10) against those who asserted the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of time, but denied the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of movement.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 8.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is prior to the world by priority of duration. But the word "prior" signifies priority not of time, but of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. Or we may say that it signifies the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> time, and not of time really <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a>; thus, when we say that above <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> there is nothing, the word "above" signifies only an <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> place, according as it is possible to <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> other dimensions beyond those of the heavenly body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 9.</strong> As the effect follows from the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that acts by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, according to the mode of its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, so likewise it follows from the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> agent, according to the form preconceived and determined by the agent, as appears from what was said above (19, 4; 41, 2). Therefore, although <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> the sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the world, we should not say that the world was produced by Him, except as preordained by His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>--that is, that it should have being after not being, in order more manifestly to declare its author.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 10.</strong> Given the action, the effect follows according to the requirement of the form, which is the principle of action. But in agents acting by will, what is conceived and preordained is to be taken as the form, which is the principle of action. Therefore from the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> action of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> effect did not follow; but such an effect as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> willed, an effect, to wit, which has being after not being.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether it is an article of faith that the world began?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is not an <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">article of faith</a> but a demonstrable conclusion that the world began. For everything that is made has a beginning of its duration. But it can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> demonstratively that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the effective <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the world; indeed this is asserted by the more approved <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>. Therefore it can be demonstratively <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that the world began.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to say that the world was made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it must therefore have been made from nothing or from something. But it was not made from something; otherwise the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the world would have preceded the world; against which are the arguments of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> (De Coelo i), who held that <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> was ungenerated. Therefore it must be said that the world was made from nothing; and thus it has being after not being. Therefore it must have begun.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, everything which works by <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> works from some principle, as appears in all kinds of craftsmen. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> acts by <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>: therefore His work has a principle. The world, therefore, which is His effect, did not always <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it appears manifestly that certain arts have developed, and certain countries have begun to be inhabited at some fixed time. But this would not be the case if the world had been always. Therefore it is manifest that the world did not always <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that nothing can be equal to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But if the world had always been, it would be equal to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in duration. Therefore it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that the world did not always <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, if the world always was, the consequence is that <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> days preceded this present day. But it is impossible to pass through an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> medium. Therefore we should never have arrived at this present day; which is manifestly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 7.</strong> Further, if the world was <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, generation also was <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. Therefore one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was begotten of another in an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> series. But the father is the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the son (Phys. ii, text 5). Therefore in efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> there could be an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> series, which is disproved (Metaph. ii, text 5).

<p><strong>Objection 8.</strong> Further, if the world and generation always were, there have been an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>: therefore an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> would actually now <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, which is impossible. Therefore it can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> that the world began, and not only is it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> demonstratively, because <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is of things "that appear not" (<a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse1">Hebrews 11:1</a>). But that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a> of the world: hence that the world began, is an <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">article of faith</a>; for we say, "I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," etc. And again, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. i in Ezech.), that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophesied</a> of the past, saying, "In the beginning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth": in which words the newness of the world is stated. Therefore the newness of the world is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> only by <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>; and therefore it cannot be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> demonstratively.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> By <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone do we hold, and by no demonstration can it be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, that the world did not always <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, as was said above of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> (32, 1). The reason of this is that the newness of the world cannot be demonstrated on the part of the world itself. For the principle of demonstration is the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of a thing. Now everything according to its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is abstracted from "here" and "now"; whence it is said that universals are everywhere and always. Hence it cannot be demonstrated that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, or <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, or a stone were not always. Likewise neither can it be demonstrated on the part of the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, which acts by will. For the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be investigated by reason, except as regards those things which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> must will of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>; and what He wills about creatures is not among these, as was said above (Question 19, Article 3). But the divine will can be manifested by <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>, on which <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> rests. Hence that the world began to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> is an object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but not of demonstration or science. And it is useful to consider this, lest anyone, presuming to demonstrate what is of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, should bring forward reasons that are not cogent, so as to give occasion to unbelievers to laugh, thinking that on such grounds we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> things that are of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xi, 4), the opinion of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> who asserted the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of the world was twofold. For some said that the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the world was not from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is an intolerable <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; and therefore it is refuted by <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> that are cogent. Some, however, said that the world was <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, although made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For they hold that the world has a beginning, not of time, but of creation, so that in a certain hardly intelligible way it was always made. "And they try to explain their meaning thus (De Civ. Dei x, 31): for as, if the foot were always in the dust from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, there would always be a footprint which without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> was <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by him who trod on it, so also the world always was, because its Maker always <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>." To understand this we must consider that the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, which acts by motion, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> precedes its effect in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>; because the effect is only in the end of the action, and every agent must be the principle of action. But if the action is instantaneous and not successive, it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the maker to be prior to the thing made in duration as appears in the case of illumination. Hence they say that it does not follow <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the active <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the world, that He should be prior to the world in duration; because creation, by which He produced the world, is not a successive change, as was said above (Question 45, Article 2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Those who would say that the world was <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, would say that the world was made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from nothing, not that it was made after nothing, according to what we understand by the word creation, but that it was not made from anything; and so also some of them do not reject the word creation, as appears from <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a> (Metaph. ix, text 4).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This is the argument of Anaxagoras (as quoted in Phys. viii, text 15). But it does not lead to a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> conclusion, except as to that <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> which deliberates in order to find out what should be done, which is like movement. Such is the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, but not the divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> (14, 7,12).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Those who hold the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of the world hold that some region was changed an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of times, from being uninhabitable to being inhabitable and "vice versa," and likewise they hold that the arts, by reason of various corruptions and <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, were subject to an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> variety of advance and decay. Hence <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> says (Meteor. i), that it is absurd from such particular changes to hold the opinion of the newness of the whole world.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Even supposing that the world always was, it would not be equal to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Consol. v, 6); because the divine Being is all being simultaneously without succession; but with the world it is otherwise.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> Passage is always understood as being from term to term. Whatever bygone day we choose, from it to the present day there is a finite number of days which can be passed through. The objection is founded on the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that, given two extremes, there is an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of mean terms.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 7.</strong> In efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> it is impossible to proceed to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> "per se"--thus, there cannot be an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> that are "per se" required for a certain effect; for instance, that a stone be moved by a stick, the stick by the hand, and so on to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>. But it is not impossible to proceed to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> "<a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>" as regards efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>; for instance, if all the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> thus <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> multiplied should have the order of only one <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, their multiplication being <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>, as an artificer acts by means of many hammers <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, because one after the other may be broken. It is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>, therefore, that one particular hammer acts after the action of another; and likewise it is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to this particular <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as generator to be generated by another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; for he generates as a man, and not as the son of another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> generating hold one grade in efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>--viz. the grade of a particular generator. Hence it is not impossible for a man to be generated by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>; but such a thing would be impossible if the generation of this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> depended upon this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and on an elementary body, and on the sun, and so on to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 8.</strong> Those who hold the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of the world evade this reason in many ways. For some do not think it impossible for there to be an actual <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, as appears from the Metaphysics of Algazel, who says that such a thing is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>. But this was disproved above (Question 7, Article 4). Some say that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is corrupted with the body. And some say that of all <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> only one will remain. But others, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says [Serm. xiv, De Temp. 4,5; De Haeres., haeres. 46; De Civ. Dei xii. 13, asserted on this account a circuit of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>--viz. that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> separated from their bodies return again thither after a course of time; a fuller consideration of which matters will be given later (75, 2; 118, 6). But be it noted that this argument considers only a particular case. Hence one might say that the world was <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, or least some creature, as an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, but not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But we are considering the question in general, as to whether any creature can <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the creation of things was in the beginning of time?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the creation of things was not in the beginning of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. For whatever is not in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, is not of any part of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. But the creation of things was not in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>; for by the creation the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of things was brought into being; and time does not measure the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of things, and especially of incorporeal things. Therefore creation was not in the beginning of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proves (Phys. vi, text 40) that everything which is made, was being made; and so to be made implies a "before" and "after." But in the beginning of time, since it is indivisible, there is no "before" and "after." Therefore, since to be <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> is a kind of "being made," it appears that things were not <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in the beginning of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, even time itself is <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>. But time cannot be <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in the beginning of time, since time is divisible, and the beginning of time is indivisible. Therefore, the creation of things was not in the beginning of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse1">Genesis 1:1</a>): "In the beginning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The words of Genesis, "In the beginning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth," are expounded in a threefold sense in order to exclude three <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. For some said that the world always was, and that time had no beginning; and to exclude this the words "In the beginning" are expounded--viz. "of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>." And some said that there are two principles of creation, one of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things and the other of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things, against which "In the beginning" is expounded--"in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>." For as the efficient principle is appropriated to the Father by reason of power, so the exemplar principle is appropriated to the Son by reason of wisdom, in order that, as it is said (<a href="../bible/psa103.htm#verse24">Psalm 103:24</a>), "Thou hast made all things in wisdom," it may be understood that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made all things in the beginning--that is, in the Son; according to the word of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse16">Colossians 1:16</a>), "In Him"--viz. the Son--"were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> all things." But others said that corporeal things were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through the medium of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> creation; and to exclude this it is expounded thus: "In the beginning"--i.e. before all things--"<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth." For four things are stated to be <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> together--viz. the empyrean <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, by which is meant the earth, time, and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Things are said to be <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in the beginning of time, not as if the beginning of time were a measure of creation, but because together with time <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This saying of the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> is understood "of being made" by means of movement, or as the term of movement. Because, since in every movement there is "before" and "after," before any one point in a given movement--that is, whilst anything is in the process of being moved and made, there is a "before" and also an "after," because what is in the beginning of movement or in its term is not in "being moved." But creation is neither movement nor the term of movement, as was said above (45, 2,3). Hence a thing is <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in such a way that it was not being <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> before.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Nothing is made except as it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>. But nothing <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> of time except "now." Hence time cannot be made except according to some "now"; not because in the first "now" is time, but because from it time begins.
