<h1>Question 46. The consent to which an oath or carnal intercourse is appended</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5046.htm#article1"> Does an oath added to the consent that is expressed in words of the future tense make a marriage?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5046.htm#article2"> Does carnal intercourse supervening to such a consent make a marriage?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether an oath added to the consent that is expressed in words of the future tense makes a marriage?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that if an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> be added to a consent that is expressed in words of the future tense it makes a marriage. For no one can bind himself to act against the Divine Law. But the fulfilling of an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is of <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> according to <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse33">Matthew 5:33</a>, "Thou shalt perform thy oaths to the Lord." Consequently no subsequent <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> can relieve a man of the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to keep an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> previously taken. If, therefore, after consenting to marry a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> by words expressive of the future and confirming that consent with an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, a man binds himself to another <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> by words expressive of the present, it would seem that none the less he is bound to keep his former <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. But this would not be the case unless that <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> made the marriage complete. Therefore an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> affixed to a consent expressed in words of the future tense makes a marriage.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is stronger than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Now an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> confirms a thing with the Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Since then words expressive of consent in the present in which there is mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> complete a marriage, it would seem that much more is this the case with words of the future confirmed by an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/heb006.htm#verse16">Hebrews 6:16</a>), "An <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> for confirmation is the end of all . . . controversy"; wherefore in a court of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> at any rate one must stand by an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> rather than by a mere affirmation. Therefore if a man consent to marry a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> by a simple affirmation expressed in words of the present, after having consented to marry another in words of the future confirmed by <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, it would seem that in the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> he should be compelled to take the first and not the second as his wife.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the simple uttering of words relating to the future makes a <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothal</a>. But the addition of an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> must have some effect. Therefore it makes something more than a <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothal</a>. Now beyond a <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothal</a> there is nothing but marriage. Therefore it makes a marriage.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> What is future is not yet. Now the addition of an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> does not make words of the future tense signify anything else than consent to something future. Therefore it is not a marriage yet.

<p>Further, after a marriage is complete, no further consent is required for the marriage. But after the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> there is yet another consent which makes the marriage, else it would be useless to swear to a future marriage. Therefore it does not make a marriage.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> An <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is employed in confirmation of one's words; wherefore it confirms that only which is signified by the words, nor does it change their signification. Consequently, since it belongs to words of the future tense, by their very signification, not to make a marriage, since what is promised in the future is not done yet, even though an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> be added to the promise, the marriage is not made yet, as the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> says in the text (Sent. iv, D, 28).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The fulfilling of a lawful <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is of <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, but not the fulfilling of an unlawful <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. Wherefore if a subsequent <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> makes that <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> unlawful, whereas it was lawful before, he who does not keep the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> he took previously does not disobey the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>. And so it is in the case in point; since he swears unlawfully who promises unlawfully; and a promise about another's property is unlawful. Consequently the subsequent consent by words of the present, whereby a man transfers the power over his body to another <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, makes the previous <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> unlawful which was lawful before.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is most efficacious in confirming that to which it is applied. Hence the Reply to the Third Objection is clear.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> has some effect, not by <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> a new <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, but confirming that which is already made, and thus he who violates it <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> more grievously.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether carnal intercourse after consent expressed in words of the future makes a marriage?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that carnal intercourse after consent expressed in words of the future makes a marriage. For consent by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> is greater than consent by word. But he who has carnal intercourse consents by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> to the promise he has previously made. Therefore it would seem that much more does this make a marriage than if he were to consent to mere words referring to the present.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, not only explicit but also interpretive consent makes a marriage. Now there can be no better interpretation of consent than carnal intercourse. Therefore marriage is completed thereby.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, all carnal union outside marriage is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, seemingly, does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by admitting her <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> to carnal intercourse. Therefore it makes a marriage.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, "Sin is not forgiven unless restitution be made," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. cliii ad Macedon.). Now a man cannot reinstate a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> whom he has violated under the pretense of marriage unless he marry her. Therefore it would seem that even if, after his carnal intercourse, he happen to contract with another by words of the present tense, he is bound to return to the first; and this would not be the case unless he were <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> to her. Therefore carnal intercourse after consent referring to the future makes a marriage.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Pope Nicholas I says (Resp. ad Consult. Bulg. iii; Cap. Tuas dudum, De clandest. despons.), "Without the consent to marriage, other things, including coition, are of no effect."

<p>Further, that which follows a thing does not make it. But carnal intercourse follows the actual marriage, as effect follows <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Therefore it cannot make a marriage.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We may speak of marriage in two ways. First, in reference to the tribunal of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and thus in very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> carnal intercourse cannot complete a marriage the promise of which has previously been made in words expressive of the future, if inward consent is lacking, since words, even though expressive of the present, would not make a marriage in the absence of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> consent, as stated above (Question 45, Article 4). Secondly, in reference to the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and since in the external tribunal judgment is given in accordance with external evidence, and since nothing is more expressly significant of consent than carnal intercourse, it follows that in the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> carnal intercourse following on <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothal</a> is declared to make a marriage, unless there appear clear signs of deceit or <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> [According to the pre-Tridentine legislation] (De sponsal. et matrim., cap. Is qui fidem).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In reality he who has carnal intercourse consents by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> to the act of sexual union, and does not merely for this reason consent to marriage except according to the interpretation of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This interpretation does not alter the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but changes the judgment which is about external things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> admit her <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a>, thinking that he wishes to consummate the marriage, she is excused from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, unless there be clear signs of <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a>; for instance if they differ considerably in birth or fortune, or some other evident sign appear. Nevertheless the affianced husband is guilty of fornication, and should be punished for this <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> he has committed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> In a case of this kind the affianced husband, before his marriage with the other <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, is bound to marry the one to whom he was <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a>, if she be his equal or superior in rank. But if he has <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> another <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, he is no longer able to fulfill his <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, wherefore it suffices if he provide for her marriage. Nor is he bound even to do this, according to some, if her affianced husband is of much higher rank than she, or if there be some evident sign of <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a>, because it may be presumed that in all probability she was not deceived but pretended to be.
