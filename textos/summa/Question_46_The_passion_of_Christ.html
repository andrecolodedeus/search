<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether it was necessary for Christ to suffer for the deliverance of the human race?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it was not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to suffer for the deliverance of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> could not be delivered except by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/isa045.htm#verse21">Isaiah 45:21</a>: "Am not I the Lord, and there is no <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> else besides Me? A just <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and a Saviour, there is none besides Me." But no <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> can compel <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for this would be repugnant to His omnipotence. Therefore it was not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to suffer.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, what is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> is opposed to what is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> suffered of His own will; for it is written (<a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse7">Isaiah 53:7</a>): "He was offered because it was His own will." Therefore it was not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for Him to suffer.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as is written (<a href="../bible/psa024.htm#verse10">Psalm 24:10</a>): "All the ways of the Lord are mercy and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." But it does not seem <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that He should suffer on the part of the Divine mercy, which, as it bestows <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> freely, so it appears to condone debts without satisfaction: nor, again, on the part of Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, according to which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had deserved everlasting condemnation. Therefore it does not seem <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should have suffered for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> deliverance.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is more excellent than the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, as appears from <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. iv). But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not suffer to repair the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>. Therefore, apparently, neither was it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for Him to suffer for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse14">John 3:14</a>): "As <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> lifted up the serpent in the desert, so must the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> be lifted up, that whosoever <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> in Him may not perish, but may have life everlasting."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> teaches (Metaph. v), there are several acceptations of the word "<a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>." In one way it means anything which of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> cannot be otherwise; and in this way it is evident that it was not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> either on the part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or on the part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to suffer. In another sense a thing may be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> from some <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> quite apart from itself; and should this be either an efficient or a moving <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> then it brings about the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of compulsion; as, for instance, when a man cannot get away owing to the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of someone else holding him. But if the external factor which induces <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> be an end, then it will be said to be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> from presupposing such end--namely, when some particular end cannot <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> at all, or not conveniently, except such end be presupposed. It was not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, then, for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to suffer from <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of compulsion, either on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> part, who ruled that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should suffer, or on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> own part, who suffered <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>. Yet it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> from <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of the end proposed; and this can be accepted in three ways. First of all, on our part, who have been delivered by His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, according to John (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse14">3:14</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> must be lifted up, that whosoever <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> in Him may not perish, but may have life everlasting." Secondly, on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> part, who <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of being exalted, through the lowliness of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>: and to this must be referred <a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse26">Luke 24:26</a>: "Ought not <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to have suffered these things, and so to enter into His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>?" Thirdly, on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> part, whose determination regarding the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion of Christ</a>, foretold in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> and prefigured in the observances of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, had to be fulfilled. And this is what St. Luke says (<a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse22">22:22</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> indeed goeth, according to that which is determined"; and (<a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse44">Luke 24:44-46</a>): "These are the words which I spoke to you while I was yet with you, that all things must needs be fulfilled which are written in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and in the psalms concerning Me: for it is thus written, and thus it behooved <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to suffer, and to rise again from the dead."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument is based on the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of compulsion on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> part.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument rests on the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of compulsion on the part of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> That <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be delivered by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> was in keeping with both His mercy and His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. With His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, because by His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> Christ made satisfaction for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>; and so <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was set free by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: and with His mercy, for since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of himself could not satisfy for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as was said above (Question 1, Article 2), <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave him His Son to satisfy for him, according to <a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse24">Romans 3:24-25</a>: "Being justified freely by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, through the redemption that is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath proposed to be a propitiation, through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in His blood." And this came of more copious mercy than if He had forgiven <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> without satisfaction. Hence it is said (<a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse4">Ephesians 2:4</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is rich in mercy, for His exceeding <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> wherewith He loved us, even when we were dead in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, hath quickened us together in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> was irreparable; not so the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> (I, 64, 2).

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether there was any other possible way of human deliverance besides the Passion of Christ?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there was no other possible way of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> deliverance besides <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> says (<a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse24">John 12:24</a>): "<a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, amen I say to you, unless the grain of wheat falling into the ground dieth, itself remaineth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit." Upon this <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> (Tract. li) observes that "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> called Himself the seed." Consequently, unless He suffered death, He would not otherwise have produced the fruit of our redemption.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> addresses the Father (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse42">Matthew 26:42</a>): "My Father, if this <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> may not pass away but I must drink it, Thy will be done." But He spoke there of the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> could not pass away; hence <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (Comm. 31 in Matth.): "Therefore the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> cannot pass except He drink of it, because we cannot be restored except through His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> required that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should satisfy by the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> in order that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> might be delivered from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> cannot let His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> pass; for it is written (<a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse13">2 Timothy 2:13</a>): "If we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not, He continueth faithful, He cannot deny Himself." But He would deny Himself were He to deny His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, since He is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> itself. It seems impossible, then, for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be delivered otherwise than by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, there can be no falsehood underlying <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But the Fathers of old <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> would suffer. Consequently, it seems that it had to be that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should suffer.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiii): "We assert that the way whereby <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> deigned to deliver us by the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, who is mediator between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, is both <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and befitting the Divine dignity; but let us also show that other possible means were not lacking on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> part, to whose power all things are equally subordinate."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing may be said to be possible or impossible in two ways: first of all, simply and absolutely; or secondly, from supposition. Therefore, speaking simply and absolutely, it was possible for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to deliver <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> otherwise than by the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion of Christ</a>, because "no word shall be impossible with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse37">Luke 1:37</a>). Yet it was impossible if some supposition be made. For since it is impossible for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> foreknowledge to be deceived and His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> or ordinance to be frustrated, then, supposing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> foreknowledge and ordinance regarding <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, it was not possible at the same time for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> not to suffer, and for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> to be delivered otherwise than by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. And the same holds good of all things foreknown and preordained by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as was laid down in I, 14, 13.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> is speaking there presupposing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> foreknowledge and predetermination, according to which it was resolved that the fruit of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> should not follow unless <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> suffered.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In the same way we must understand what is here objected to in the second instance: "If this <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> may not pass away but I must drink of it"--that is to say, because Thou hast so ordained it--hence He adds: "Thy will be done."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Even this <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> depends on the Divine will, requiring satisfaction for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. But if He had willed to free <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> without any satisfaction, He would not have acted against <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. For a judge, while preserving <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, cannot pardon fault without penalty, if he must visit fault committed against another--for instance, against another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, or against the State, or any Prince in higher authority. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has no one higher than Himself, for He is the sovereign and common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. Consequently, if He forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which has the formality of fault in that it is committed against Himself, He wrongs no one: just as anyone else, overlooking a personal trespass, without satisfaction, acts mercifully and not <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>. And so David exclaimed when he sought mercy: "To Thee only have I <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>" (<a href="../bible/psa050.htm#verse6">Psalm 50:6</a>), as if to say: "Thou canst pardon me without <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Human</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and even the <a href="../bible/index.html">Divine Scriptures</a> upon which <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is based, are both based on the Divine foreknowledge and ordinance. And the same reason holds good of that <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> which comes of supposition, and of the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> which arises of the Divine foreknowledge and will.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether there was any more suitable way of delivering the human race than by Christ's Passion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there was some other more suitable way of delivering the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> besides <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>. For <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in its operation imitates the Divine work, since it is moved and regulated by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> never employs two agents where one will suffice. Therefore, since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> could have liberated <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> solely by His Divine will, it does not seem fitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> should have been added for the deliverance of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> actions are more suitably performed than <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, because <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> is "a severance or lapse from what is according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>," as is said in De Coelo ii. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> brought about His death by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. Therefore it would have been more appropriate had <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> died a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> death rather than suffer for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> deliverance.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it seems most fitting that whatsoever keeps something <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> and by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, should be deprived of it by some superior power; hence Isaias says (52:3): "You were sold gratis, and you shall be redeemed without money." But the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> possessed no right over <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, whom he had deceived by guile, and whom he held subject in servitude by a sort of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. Therefore it seems most suitable that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should have despoiled the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> solely by His power and without the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiii): "There was no other more suitable way of healing our misery" than by the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion of Christ</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Among means to an end that one is the more suitable whereby the various concurring means employed are themselves helpful to such end. But in this that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was delivered by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, many other things besides deliverance from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> concurred for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. In the first place, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> thereby how much <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> loves him, and is thereby stirred to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him in return, and herein lies the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse8">Romans 5:8</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> commendeth His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> towards us; for when as yet we were sinners . . . <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> died for us." Secondly, because thereby He set us an example of obedience, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, constancy, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> displayed in the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, which are requisite for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse21">1 Peter 2:21</a>): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> also suffered for us, leaving you an example that you should follow in His steps." Thirdly, because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> not only delivered <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but also <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> justifying <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> for him and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of bliss, as shall be shown later (48, 1; 49, 1, 5). Fourthly, because by this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is all the more bound to refrain from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse20">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>: "You are bought with a great price: glorify and bear <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in your body." Fifthly, because it redounded to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> greater dignity, that as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was overcome and deceived by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, so also it should be a man that should overthrow the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; and as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> deserved death, so a man by dying should vanquish death. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse57">1 Corinthians 15:57</a>): "Thanks be to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who hath given us the victory through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>." It was accordingly more fitting that we should be delivered by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> than simply by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>-will.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Even <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> uses several means to one intent, in order to do something more fittingly: as two eyes for seeing; and the same can be observed in other matters.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> [<a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, Orat. De Incarn. Verb.] says: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had come in order to destroy death, not His own, (for since He is life itself, death could not be His), but men's death. Hence it was not by reason of His being bound to die that He laid His body aside, but because the death He endured was inflicted on Him by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. But even if His body had sickened and dissolved in the sight of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, it was not befitting Him who healed the infirmities of others to have his own body afflicted with the same. And even had He laid His body aside without any sickness, and had then appeared, men would not have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> Him when He spoke of His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>. For how could <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> victory over death appear, unless He endured it in the sight of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and so <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that death was vanquished by the incorruption of His body?"

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> assailed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>, nevertheless, on account of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> left by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> under the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> bondage. And therefore it was fitting that through <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be delivered from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> bondage by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> making satisfaction on his behalf in the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. This was also a fitting means of overthrowing the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, "who is a deserter from <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and covetous of sway"; in that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> "should vanquish him and deliver <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, not merely by the power of His Godhead, but likewise by the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and lowliness of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiii).

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether Christ ought to have suffered on the cross?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> ought not to have suffered on the cross. For the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> ought to conform to the figure. But in all the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> which prefigured <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the beasts were slain with a sword and afterwards consumed by fire. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> ought not to have suffered on a cross, but rather by the sword or by fire.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii) that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> ought not to assume "dishonoring afflictions." But death on a cross was most dishonoring and ignominious; hence it is written (<a href="../bible/wis002.htm#verse20">Wisdom 2:20</a>): "Let us condemn Him to a most shameful death." Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> ought not to have undergone the death of the cross.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it was said of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse9">Matthew 21:9</a>): "Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord." But death upon the cross was a death of malediction, as we read <a href="../bible/deu021.htm#verse23">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>: "He is <a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">accursed</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that hangeth on a tree." Therefore it does not seem fitting for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be crucified.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse8">Philippians 2:8</a>): "He became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It was most fitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should suffer the death of the cross.

<p>First of all, as an example of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> thus writes (QQ. lxxxiii, qu. 25): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> Wisdom became <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to give us an example in righteousness of living. But it is part of righteous living not to stand in fear of things which ought not to be feared. Now there are some men who, although they do not fear death in itself, are yet troubled over the manner of their death. In order, then, that no kind of death should trouble an upright <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the cross of this Man had to be set before him, because, among all kinds of death, none was more execrable, more fear-inspiring, than this."

<p>Secondly, because this kind of death was especially suitable in order to <a href="../cathen/02055a.htm">atone</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a>, which was the plucking of the apple from the forbidden tree against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> command. And so, to <a href="../cathen/02055a.htm">atone</a> for that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it was fitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should suffer by being fastened to a tree, as if restoring what <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> had purloined; according to <a href="../bible/psa068.htm#verse5">Psalm 68:5</a>: "Then did I pay that which I took not away." Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a sermon on the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> [Cf. Serm. ci De Tempore]: "<a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> despised the command, plucking the apple from the tree: but all that <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> lost, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> found upon the cross."

<p>The third reason is because, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says in a sermon on the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> (De Cruce et Latrone i, ii): "He suffered upon a high rood and not under a roof, in order that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the air might be purified: and the earth felt a like benefit, for it was cleansed by the flowing of the blood from His side." And on <a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse14">John 3:14</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> must be lifted up," Theophylact says: "When you hear that He was lifted up, understand His hanging on high, that He might sanctify the air who had sanctified the earth by walking upon it."

<p>The fourth reason is, because, by dying on it, He prepares for us an ascent into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> [<a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, vide A, III, ad 2] says. Hence it is that He says (<a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse32">John 12:32</a>): "If I be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all things to Myself."

<p>The fifth reason is because it is befitting the universal <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the entire world. Hence <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> observes (In Christ. Resurr., Orat. i) that "the shape of the cross extending out into four extremes from their central point of contact denotes the power and the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> diffused everywhere of Him who hung upon it." <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> [<a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, vide A. III, ad 2] also says that upon the cross "He dies with outstretched hands in order to draw with one hand the people of old, and with the other those who spring from the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>."

<p>The sixth reason is because of the various <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> denoted by this class of death. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> in his book on the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Old and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> (Ep. cxl) says: "Not without purpose did He choose this class of death, that He might be a teacher of that breadth, and height, and length, and depth," of which the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> speaks (<a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse18">Ephesians 3:18</a>): "For breadth is in the beam, which is fixed transversely above; this appertains to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works, since the hands are stretched out upon it. Length is the tree's extent from the beam to the ground; and there it is planted--that is, it stands and abides--which is the note of longanimity. Height is in that portion of the tree which remains over from the transverse beam upwards to the top, and this is at the head of the Crucified, because He is the supreme desire of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> hope. But that part of the tree which is hidden from view to hold it fixed, and from which the entire rood springs, denotes the depth of gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>." And, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. cxix in Joan.): "The tree upon which were fixed the members of Him dying was even the chair of the Master teaching."

<p>The seventh reason is because this kind of death responds to very many figures. For, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a sermon on the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> (Serm. ci De Tempore), an ark of wood preserved the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> from the waters of the <a href="../cathen/04702a.htm">Deluge</a>; at the exodus of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> people from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> with a rod divided the sea, overthrew <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> and saved the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. the same <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> dipped his rod into the water, changing it from bitter to sweet; at the touch of a wooden rod a salutary spring gushed forth from a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> rock; likewise, in order to overcome <a href="../cathen/01377c.htm">Amalec</a>, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> stretched forth his arms with rod in hand; lastly, <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">God's law</a> is entrusted to the wooden Ark of the Covenant; all of which are like steps by which we mount to the wood of the cross.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The altar of holocausts, upon which the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of animals were immolated, was constructed of timbers, as is set forth <a href="../bible/exo027.htm">Exodus 27</a>:, and in this respect the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> answers to the figure; but "it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for it to be likened in every respect, otherwise it would not be a likeness," but the reality, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii). But in particular, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> [<a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, vide A, III, ad 2] says: "His head is not cut off, as was done to John; nor was He sawn in twain, like Isaias, in order that His entire and indivisible body might obey death, and that there might be no excuse for them who want to divide the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>." While, instead of material fire, there was the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> fire of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> refused to undergo dishonorable sufferings which are allied with defects of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, or of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, or even of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but not those injuries inflicted from without--nay, more, as is written <a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse2">Hebrews 12:2</a>: "He endured the cross, despising the shame."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Faust. xiv), <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">accursed</a>, and, consequently, so is death, and mortality, which comes of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. "But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh was mortal, 'having the resemblance of the flesh of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>'"; and hence <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> calls it "<a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">accursed</a>," just as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> calls it "<a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>," saying (<a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse21">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>): "Him that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for us He hath made <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>"--namely, because of the penalty of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. "Nor is there greater ignominy on that account, because he said: 'He is <a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">accursed</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.'" For, "unless <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, He would never have sent His Son to take upon Himself our death, and to destroy it. Acknowledge, then, that it was for us He took the curse upon Himself, whom you confess to have died for us." Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse13">Galatians 3:13</a>): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> hath redeemed us from the curse of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, being made a curse for us."

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether Christ endured all suffering?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did endure all sufferings, because <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> (De Trin. x) says: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> only-begotten Son testifies that He endured every kind of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> sufferings in order to accomplish the sacrament of His death, when with bowed head He gave up the ghost." It seems, therefore, that He did endure all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> sufferings.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/isa052.htm#verse13">Isaiah 52:13</a>): "Behold My servant shall understand, He shall be exalted and extolled, and shall be exceeding high; as many as have been astonished at Him [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'thee', so shall His visage be inglorious among men, and His form among the sons of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was exalted in that He had all <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, at which many were astonished in admiration thereof. Therefore it seems that He was "inglorious," by enduring every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> suffering.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> was ordained for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> deliverance from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> came to deliver men from every kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore He ought to have endured every kind of suffering.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse32">John 19:32</a>): "The soldiers therefore came: and they broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified with Him; but after they were come to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, when they saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs." Consequently, He did not endure every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> suffering.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Human</a> sufferings may be considered under two aspects. First of all, specifically, and in this way it was not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to endure them all, since many are mutually exclusive, as burning and drowning; for we are dealing now with sufferings inflicted from without, since it was not beseeming for Him to endure those arising from within, such as bodily ailments, as already stated (14, 4). But, speaking generically, He did endure every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> suffering. This admits of a threefold acceptance. First of all, on the part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: for He endured something from <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> and from <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>; from men and from <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, as is clear from the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> servants who accused Peter. He suffered from the rulers, from their servants and from the mob, according to <a href="../bible/psa002.htm#verse1">Psalm 2:1-2</a>: "Why have the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> raged, and the people devised vain things? The kings of the earth stood up, and the princes met together, against the Lord and against His <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." He suffered from friends and acquaintances, as is manifest from <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> betraying and Peter denying Him.

<p>Secondly, the same is evident on the part of the sufferings which a man can endure. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> suffered from friends abandoning Him; in His reputation, from the blasphemies hurled at Him; in His <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, from the mockeries and the insults heaped upon Him; in things, for He was despoiled of His garments; in His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, from sadness, weariness, and fear; in His body, from wounds and scourgings.

<p>Thirdly, it may be considered with regard to His bodily members. In His head He suffered from the crown of piercing thorns; in His hands and feet, from the fastening of the nails; on His face from the blows and spittle; and from the lashes over His entire body. Moreover, He suffered in all His bodily senses: in touch, by being scourged and nailed; in taste, by being given vinegar and gall to drink; in smell, by being fastened to the gibbet in a place reeking with the stench of corpses, "which is called Calvary"; in hearing, by being tormented with the cries of blasphemers and scorners; in sight, by beholding the tears of His Mother and of the disciple whom He loved.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary's</a> words are to be understood as to all classes of sufferings, but not as to their kinds.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The likeness is sustained, not as to the number of the sufferings and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>, but as to their greatness; for, as He was uplifted above others in <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>, so was He lowered beneath others by the ignominy of His sufferings.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The very least one of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sufferings was sufficient of itself to redeem the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> from all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; but as to fittingness, it sufficed that He should endure all classes of sufferings, as stated above.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the pain of Christ's Passion was greater than all other pains?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the pain of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> was not greater than all other pains. For the sufferer's pain is increased by the sharpness and the duration of the suffering. But some of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> endured sharper and more prolonged pains than <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as is seen in St. Lawrence, who was roasted upon a gridiron; and in St. Vincent, whose flesh was torn with iron pincers. Therefore it seems that the pain of the suffering <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not the greatest.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, strength of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> mitigates pain, so much so that the Stoics held there was no sadness in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; and <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> (Ethic. ii) holds that moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> fixes the mean in the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had most perfect strength of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore it seems that the greatest pain did not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the more sensitive the sufferer is, the more acute will the pain be. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is more sensitive than the body, since the body feels in virtue of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; also, <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> in the state of innocence seems to have had a body more sensitive than <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had, who assumed a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body with its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> defects. Consequently, it seems that the pain of a sufferer in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>, or in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, or even <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam's</a> pain, if he suffered at all, was greater than <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the greater the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> lost, the greater the pain. But by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> the sinner loses a greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> than <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did when suffering; since the life of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is greater than the life of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: also, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who lost His life, but was to rise again after three days, seems to have lost less than those who lose their lives and abide in death. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> pain was not the greatest of all.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the victim's innocence lessens the sting of his sufferings. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> died innocent, according to <a href="../bible/jer009.htm#verse19">Jeremiah 9:19</a>: "I was as a meek lamb, that is carried to be a victim." Therefore it seems that the pain of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> was not the greatest.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, there was nothing superfluous in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> conduct. But the slightest pain would have sufficed to secure <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, because from His Divine Person it would have had <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore it would have been superfluous to choose the greatest of all pains.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/lam001.htm#verse12">Lamentations 1:12</a>) on behalf of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Person: "O all ye that pass by the way attend, and see if there be any sorrow like unto My sorrow."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As we have stated, when treating of the defects assumed by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (15, 5,6), there was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and sensible pain in the suffering <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by something hurtful to the body: also, there was internal pain, which is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> from the apprehension of something hurtful, and this is termed "sadness." And in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> each of these was the greatest in this present life. This arose from four <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>.

<p>First of all, from the sources of His pain. For the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the sensitive pain was the wounding of His body; and this wounding had its bitterness, both from the extent of the suffering already mentioned (5]) and from the kind of suffering, since the death of the crucified is most bitter, because they are pierced in nervous and highly sensitive parts--to wit, the hands and feet; moreover, the weight of the suspended body intensifies the agony. And besides this there is the duration of the suffering because they do not die at once like those slain by the sword. The <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the interior pain was, first of all, all the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, for which He made satisfaction by suffering; hence He ascribes them, so to speak, to Himself, saying (<a href="../bible/psa021.htm#verse2">Psalm 21:2</a>): "The words of my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>."

<p>Secondly, especially the fall of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> and of the others who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in His death chiefly of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, who were scandalized at His Passion. Thirdly, the loss of His bodily life, which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> horrible to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p>The magnitude of His suffering may be considered, secondly, from the susceptibility of the sufferer as to both <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body. For His body was endowed with a most perfect constitution, since it was fashioned <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> by the operation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; just as some other things made by <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are better than others, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. xxii in Joan.) respecting the wine into which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> changed the water at the wedding-feast. And, consequently, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sense of touch, the sensitiveness of which is the reason for our feeling pain, was most acute. His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> likewise, from its interior powers, apprehended most vehemently all the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of sadness.

<p>Thirdly, the magnitude of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> suffering can be estimated from the singleness of His pain and sadness. In other sufferers the interior sadness is mitigated, and even the exterior suffering, from some consideration of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, by some derivation or redundance from the higher powers into the lower; but it was not so with the suffering <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, because "He permitted each one of His powers to exercise its proper function," as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii).

<p>Fourthly, the magnitude of the pain of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> suffering can be reckoned by this, that the pain and sorrow were accepted <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>, to the end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> deliverance from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and consequently He embraced the amount of pain proportionate to the magnitude of the fruit which resulted therefrom.

<p>From all these <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> weighed together, it follows that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> pain was the very greatest.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument follows from only one of the considerations adduced--namely, from the bodily injury, which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sensitive pain; but the torment of the suffering <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is much more intensified from other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, as above stated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> lessens interior sadness in one way, and outward sensitive pain in quite another; for it lessens interior sadness directly by fixing the mean, as being its proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, within limits. But, as was laid down in I-II, 64, 2, moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> fixes the mean in the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, not according to mathematical <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, but according to <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of proportion, so that the passion shall not go beyond the rule of reason. And since the Stoics held all sadness to be unprofitable, they accordingly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> it to be altogether discordant with reason, and consequently to be shunned altogether by a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But in very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> some sadness is praiseworthy, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> proves (De Civ. Dei xiv)--namely, when it flows from <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> love, as, for instance, when a man is saddened over his own or others' <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Furthermore, it is employed as a useful means of satisfying for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, according to the saying of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/2co007.htm#verse10">2 Corinthians 7:10</a>): "The sorrow that is according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> worketh penance, steadfast unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>." And so to <a href="../cathen/02055a.htm">atone</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, Christ accepted sadness, the greatest in absolute <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, yet not exceeding the rule of reason. But moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> does not lessen outward sensitive pain, because such pain is not subject to reason, but follows the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the body; yet it lessens it indirectly by redundance of the higher powers into the lower. But this did not happen in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> case, as stated above (cf. 14, 1, ad 2; 45, 2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The pain of a suffering, separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> belongs to the state of future condemnation, which exceeds every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of this life, just as the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> surpasses every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the present life. Accordingly, when we say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> pain was the greatest, we make no comparison between His and the pain of a separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam's</a> body could not suffer, except he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>. so that he would become mortal, and passible. And, though actually suffering, it would have felt less pain than <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, for the reasons already stated. From all this it is clear that even if by impassibility <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> had suffered in the state of innocence, his pain would have been less than Christ's.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> grieved not only over the loss of His own bodily life, but also over the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of all others. And this grief in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> surpassed all grief of every <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a> heart, both because it flowed from a greater wisdom and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, by which the pang of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is intensified, and because He grieved at the one time for all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, according to <a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse4">Isaiah 53:4</a>: "Surely He hath carried our sorrows." But such was the dignity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> life in the body, especially on account of the Godhead united with it, that its loss, even for one hour, would be a matter of greater grief than the loss of another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> life for howsoever long a time. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii) that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> loves his life all the more in proportion as he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it to be better; and yet he exposes it for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue's</a> sake. And in like fashion <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> laid down His most beloved life for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, according to <a href="../bible/jer012.htm#verse7">Jeremiah 12:7</a>: "I have given My dear <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> into the hands of her enemies."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The sufferer's innocence does lessen numerically the pain of the suffering, since, when a guilty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> suffers, he grieves not merely on account of the penalty, but also because of the crime. whereas the innocent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> grieves only for the penalty: yet this pain is more intensified by reason of his innocence, in so far as he deems the hurt inflicted to be the more undeserved. Hence it is that even others are more deserving of blame if they do not compassionate him. according to <a href="../bible/isa057.htm#verse1">Isaiah 57:1</a>: "The just perisheth, and no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> layeth it to heart."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> willed to deliver the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not merely by His power, but also according to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. And therefore He did not simply weigh what great <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> His suffering would have from union with the Godhead, but also how much, according to His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, His pain would avail for so great a satisfaction.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether Christ suffered in His whole soul?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not suffer in His whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> suffers indirectly when the body suffers, inasmuch as it is the "act of the body." But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not, as to its every part, the "act of the body"; because the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the act of no body, as is said De Anima iii. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not suffer in His whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is passive in regard to its proper object. But the higher part of reason has for its object the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> types, "to the consideration and consultation of which it directs itself," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xii). But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> could suffer no hurt from the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> types, since they are nowise opposed to Him. Therefore it seems that He did not suffer in His whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a sensitive passion is said to be complete when it comes into contact with the reason. But there was none such in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but only "pro-<a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>"; as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> remarks on <a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse37">Matthew 26:37</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says in a letter to <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John the Evangelist</a> that "He endured only <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mentally</a> the sufferings inflicted upon Him." Consequently it does not seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> suffered in His whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, suffering <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> pain: but there is no pain in the speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, because, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Topic. i), "there is no sadness in opposition to the pleasure which comes of consideration." Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not suffer in His whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa087.htm#verse4">Psalm 87:4</a>) on behalf of Christ: "My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is filled with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>": upon which the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> adds: "Not with <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, but with woes, whereby the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> suffers with the flesh; or with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, viz. of a perishing people, by compassionating them." But His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> would not have been filled with these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> except He had suffered in His whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> suffered in His entire <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A whole is so termed with respect to its parts. But the parts of a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are its faculties. So, then, the whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is said to suffer in so far as it is afflicted as to its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, or as to all its faculties. But it must be borne in mind that a faculty of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> can suffer in two ways: first of all, by its own passion; and this comes of its being afflicted by its proper object; thus, sight may suffer from superabundance of the visible object. In another way a faculty suffers by a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> in the subject on which it is based; as sight suffers when the sense of touch in the eye is affected, upon which the sense of sight rests, as, for instance, when the eye is pricked, or is disaffected by heat.

<p>So, then, we say that if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be considered with respect to its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, it is evident that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> suffered. For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> whole <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is allied with the body, so that it is entire in the whole body and in its every part. Consequently, when the body suffered and was disposed to separate from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the entire <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> suffered. But if we consider the whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> according to its faculties, speaking thus of the proper <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the faculties, He suffered indeed as to all His lower powers; because in all the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> lower powers, whose operations are but temporal, there was something to be found which was a source of woe to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as is evident from what was said above (<a href="#6">Article 6</a>). But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> higher reason did not suffer thereby on the part of its object, which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, not of grief, but rather of delight and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Nevertheless, all the powers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> did suffer according as any faculty is said to be affected as regards its subject, because all the faculties of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> were rooted in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, to which suffering extended when the body, whose act it is, suffered.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> as a faculty is not the act of the body, still the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is the act of the body, and in it the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> faculty is rooted, as was shown in I, 77, 6,8.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument proceeds from passion on the part of the proper object, according to which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> higher reason did not suffer.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Grief is then said to be a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> passion, by which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is troubled, when the passion in the sensitive part <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> reason to deflect from the rectitude of its act, so that it then follows the passion, and has no longer <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> with regard to it. In this way passion of the sensitive part did not extend to reason in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but merely subjectively, as was stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can have no pain or sadness on the part of its object, which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> considered absolutely, and which is its perfection: nevertheless, both grief and its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> can reach it in the way mentioned above.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether Christ's entire soul enjoyed blessed fruition during the Passion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> entire <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> did not enjoy blessed fruition during the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. For it is not possible to be sad and glad at the one time, since sadness and gladness are contraries. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> suffered grief during the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, as was stated above (<a href="#7">Article 7</a>). Therefore His whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> could not enjoy fruition.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii) that, if sadness be vehement, it not only checks the contrary delight, but every delight; and conversely. But the grief of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> was the greatest, as shown above (<a href="#6">Article 6</a>); and likewise the enjoyment of fruition is also the greatest, as was laid down in the first volume of I-II, 34, 3. Consequently, it was not possible for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be suffering and rejoicing at the one time.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, beatific "fruition" comes of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and love of Divine things, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Doctr. Christ. i). But all the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> powers do not extend to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> did not enjoy fruition.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii): <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Godhead "permitted His flesh to do and to suffer what was proper to it." In like fashion, since it belonged to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, inasmuch as it was blessed, to enjoy fruition, His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> did not impede fruition.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#7">Article 7</a>), the whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> can be understood both according to its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and according to all its faculties. If it be understood according to its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, then His whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> did enjoy fruition, inasmuch as it is the subject of the higher part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, to which it belongs, to enjoy the Godhead: so that as passion, by reason of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, is attributed to the higher part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, so, on the other hand, by reason of the superior part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, fruition is attributed to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. But if we take the whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as comprising all its faculties, thus His entire <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> did not enjoy fruition: not directly, indeed, because fruition is not the act of any one part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; nor by any overflow of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, because, since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was still upon earth, there was no overflowing of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> from the higher part into the lower, nor from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> into the body. But since, on the contrary, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> higher part was not hindered in its proper acts by the lower, it follows that the higher part of His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> enjoyed fruition perfectly while <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was suffering.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of fruition is not opposed directly to the grief of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, because they have not the same object. Now nothing prevents contraries from being in the same subject, but not according to the same. And so the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of fruition can appertain to the higher part of reason by its proper act; but grief of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> according to the subject. Grief of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> belongs to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by reason of the body, whose form the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is; whereas the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of fruition (belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>) by reason of the faculty in which it is subjected.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher's</a> contention is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> because of the overflow which takes place <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> of one faculty of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> into another; but it was not so with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as was said above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Such argument holds good of the totality of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with regard to its faculties.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether Christ suffered at a suitable time?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not suffer at a suitable time. For <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> was prefigured by the sacrifice of the Paschal lamb: hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse7">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> our Pasch is sacrificed." But the paschal lamb was slain "on the fourteenth day at eventide," as is stated in <a href="../bible/exo012.htm#verse6">Exodus 12:6</a>. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> ought to have suffered then; which is manifestly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>: for He was then celebrating the Pasch with His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, according to Mark's account (<a href="../bible/mar014.htm#verse12">14:12</a>): "On the first day of the unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the Pasch"; whereas it was on the following day that He suffered.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> is called His uplifting, according to <a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse14">John 3:14</a>: "So must the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> be lifted up." And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is Himself called the Sun of Justice, as we read <a href="../bible/mal004.htm#verse2">Malachi 4:2</a>. Therefore it seems that He ought to have suffered at the sixth hour, when the sun is at its highest point, and yet the contrary appears from <a href="../bible/mar015.htm#verse25">Mark 15:25</a>: "It was the third hour, and they crucified Him."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as the sun is at its highest point in each day at the sixth hour, so also it reaches its highest point in every year at the summer solstice. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> ought to have suffered about the time of the summer solstice rather than about the vernal equinox.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the world was enlightened by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> presence in it, according to <a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse5">John 9:5</a>: "As long as I am in the world I am the light of the world." Consequently it was fitting for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should have lived longer in the world, so that He should have suffered, not in young, but in old, age.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse1">John 13:1</a>): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that His hour was come for Him to pass out of this world to the Father"; and (<a href="../bible/joh002.htm#verse4">John 2:4</a>): "My hour is not yet come." Upon which texts <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> observes: "When He had done as much as He deemed sufficient, then came His hour, not of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, but of will, not of <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, but of power." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> died at an opportune time.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was observed above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> was subject to His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. But His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> was ruled by the Divine wisdom which "ordereth all things" conveniently and "sweetly" (<a href="../bible/wis008.htm#verse1">Wisdom 8:1</a>). Consequently it must be said that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> was enacted at an opportune time. Hence it is written in De Qq. Vet. et Nov. Test., qu. lv: "The Saviour did everything in its proper place and season."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Some hold that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did die on the fourteenth day of the moon, when the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> sacrificed the Pasch: hence it is stated (<a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse28">John 18:28</a>) that the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> "went not into <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate's</a> hall" on the day of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, "that they might not be defiled, but that they might eat the Pasch." Upon this <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> observes (Hom. lxxxii in Joan.): "The <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> celebrated the Pasch then; but He celebrated the Pasch on the previous day, reserving His own slaying until the Friday, when the old Pasch was kept." And this appears to tally with the statement (<a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse1">John 13:1-5</a>) that "before the festival day of the Pasch . . . when supper was done" . . . Christ washed "the feet of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>."

<p>But Matthew's account (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse17">26:17</a>) seems opposed to this; that "on the first day of the Azymes the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> came to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, saying: Where wilt Thou that we prepare for Thee to eat the Pasch?" From which, as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says, "since the fourteenth day of the first month is called the day of the Azymes, when the lamb was slain, and when it was full moon," it is quite clear that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> kept the supper on the fourteenth and died on the fifteenth. And this comes out more clearly from <a href="../bible/mar014.htm#verse12">Mark 14:12</a>: "On the first day of the unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the Pasch," etc.; and from <a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse7">Luke 22:7</a>: "The day of the unleavened bread came, on which it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the Pasch should be killed."

<p>Consequently, then, others say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> ate the Pasch with His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> on the proper day--that is, on the fourteenth day of the moon--"showing thereby that up to the last day He was not opposed to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>," as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. lxxxi in Matth.): but that the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, being busied in compassing <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death against the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, put off celebrating the Pasch until the following day. And on this account it is said of them that on the day of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> they were unwilling to enter <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate's</a> hall, "that they might not be defiled, but that they might eat the Pasch."

<p>But even this solution does not tally with Mark, who says: "On the first day of the unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the Pasch." Consequently <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> celebrated the ancient Pasch at the one time. And as <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> says on <a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse7">Luke 22:7-8</a>: "Although <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> who is our Pasch was slain on the following day--that is, on the fifteenth day of the moon--nevertheless, on the night when the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a> was sacrificed, delivering to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to be celebrated, the mysteries of His body and blood, and being held and bound by the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, He hallowed the opening of His own immolation--that is, of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>."

<p>But the words (<a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse1">John 13:1</a>) "Before the festival day of the Pasch" are to be understood to refer to the fourteenth day of the moon, which then fell upon the Thursday: for the fifteenth day of the moon was the most <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> day of the Pasch with the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>: and so the same day which John calls "before the festival day of the Pasch," on account of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> distinction of days, Matthew calls the first day of the unleavened bread, because, according to the rite of the Jewish festivity, the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> began from the evening of the preceding day. When it is said, then, that they were going to eat the Pasch on the fifteenth day of the month, it is to be understood that the Pasch there is not called the Paschal lamb, which was sacrificed on the fourteenth day, but the Paschal food--that is, the unleavened bread--which had to be eaten by the clean. Hence <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> in the same passage gives another explanation, that the Pasch can be taken as meaning the whole feast of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, which lasted seven days.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Consensu Evang. iii): "'It was about the sixth hour' when the Lord was delivered up by <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> to be crucified," as John relates. For it "was not quite the sixth hour, but about the sixth--that is, it was after the fifth, and when part of the sixth had been entered upon until the sixth hour was ended--that the darkness began, when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> hung upon the cross. It is understood to have been the third hour when the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> clamored for the Lord to be crucified: and it is most clearly shown that they crucified Him when they clamored out. Therefore, lest anyone might divert the thought of so great a crime from the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> to the soldiers, he says: 'It was the third hour, and they crucified Him,' that they before all may be found to have crucified Him, who at the third hour clamored for His crucifixion. Although there are not wanting some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who wish the Parasceve to be understood as the third hour, which John recalls, saying: 'It was the Parasceve, about the sixth hour.' For 'Parasceve' is interpreted 'preparation.' But the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Pasch, which was celebrated in the Lord's <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, began to be prepared from the ninth hour of the night--namely, when the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> said: 'He is deserving of death.'" According to John, then, "the sixth hour of the Parasceve" lasts from that hour of the night down to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> crucifixion; while, according to Mark, it is the third hour of the day.

<p>Still, there are some who contend that this discrepancy is due to the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of a Greek transcriber: since the characters employed by them to represent 3 and 6 are somewhat alike.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> According to the author of De Qq. Vet. et Nov. Test., qu. lv, "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> willed to redeem and reform the world by His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, at the time of year at which He had <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> it--that is, at the equinox. It is then that day grows upon night; because by our Saviour's <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> we are brought from darkness to light." And since the perfect enlightening will come about at <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> second coming, therefore the season of His second coming is compared (<a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse32">Matthew 24:32-33</a>) to the summer in these words: "When the branch thereof is now tender, and the leaves come forth, you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that summer is nigh: so you also, when you shall see all these things, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> ye that it is nigh even at the doors." And then also shall be <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> greatest exaltation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> willed to suffer while yet young, for three reasons. First of all, to commend the more His love by giving up His life for us when He was in His most perfect state of life. Secondly, because it was not becoming for Him to show any decay of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> nor to be subject to disease, as stated above (Question 14, Article 4). Thirdly, that by dying and rising at an early age <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> might exhibit beforehand in His own <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> the future <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of those who rise again. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse13">Ephesians 4:13</a>): "Until we all meet into the unity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, unto a perfect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, unto the measure of the age of the fulness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>."

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether Christ suffered in a suitable place?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not suffer in a suitable place. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> suffered according to His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which was conceived in Nazareth and born in Bethlehem. Consequently it seems that He ought not to have suffered in Jerusalem, but in Nazareth or Bethlehem.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the reality ought to correspond with the figure. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> was prefigured by the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, and these were offered up in the Temple. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> ought to have suffered in the Temple, and not outside the city gate.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the medicine should correspond with the disease. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> was the medicine against <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was not buried in Jerusalem, but in Hebron; for it is written (<a href="../bible/jos014.htm#verse15">Joshua 14:15</a>): "The name of Hebron before was called Cariath-Arbe: <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> the greatest in the land of [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'among'] the Enacims was laid there."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/luk013.htm#verse33">Luke 13:33</a>): "It cannot be that a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> perish out of Jerusalem." Therefore it was fitting that He should die in Jerusalem.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to the author of De Qq. Vet. et Nov. Test., qu. lv, "the Saviour did everything in its proper place and season," because, as all things are in His hands, so are all places: and consequently, since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> suffered at a suitable time, so did He in a suitable place.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> died most appropriately in Jerusalem. First of all, because Jerusalem was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> chosen place for the offering of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to Himself: and these figurative <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> foreshadowed <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, which is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sacrifice, according to <a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse2">Ephesians 5:2</a>: "He hath delivered Himself for us, an oblation and a sacrifice to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for an odor of sweetness." Hence <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> says in a Homily (xxiii): "When the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> drew nigh, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> willed to draw nigh to the place of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>"--that is to say, to Jerusalem--whither He came five days before the Pasch; just as, according to the legal precept, the Paschal lamb was led to the place of immolation five days before the Pasch, which is the tenth day of the moon.

<p>Secondly, because the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> was to be spread over the whole world, He wished to suffer in the center of the habitable world--that is, in Jerusalem. Accordingly it is written (<a href="../bible/psa073.htm#verse12">Psalm 73:12</a>): "But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is our King before ages: He hath wrought <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in the midst of the earth"--that is, in Jerusalem, which is called "the navel of the earth" [Cf. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome's</a> comment on <a href="../bible/eze005.htm#verse5">Ezekiel 5:5</a>].

<p>Thirdly, because it was specially in keeping with His <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>: that, as He chose the most shameful manner of death, so likewise it was part of His <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> that He did not refuse to suffer in so celebrated a place. Hence Pope Leo says (Serm. I in Epiph.): "He who had taken upon Himself the form of a servant chose Bethlehem for His nativity and Jerusalem for His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>."

<p>Fourthly, He willed to suffer in Jerusalem, where the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> dwelt, to show that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of His slayers arose from the chiefs of the Jewish people. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse27">Acts 4:27</a>): "There assembled together in this city against Thy <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> child <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> whom Thou hast anointed, Herod, and <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> and the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> For three reasons <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> suffered outside the gate, and not in the Temple nor in the city. First of all, that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> might correspond with the figure. For the calf and the goat which were offered in most <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> sacrifice for expiation on behalf of the entire multitude were burnt outside the camp, as commanded in <a href="../bible/lev016.htm#verse27">Leviticus 16:27</a>. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse27">Hebrews 13:27</a>): "For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the holies by the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, are burned without the camp. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> also, that He might sanctify the people by His own blood, suffered without the gate."

<p>Secondly, to set us the example of shunning worldly conversation. Accordingly the passage continues: "Let us go forth therefore to Him without the camp, bearing His reproach."

<p>Thirdly, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says in a sermon on the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> (Hom. i De Cruce et Latrone): "The Lord was not willing to suffer under a roof, nor in the Jewish Temple, lest the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> might take away the saving sacrifice, and lest you might think He was offered for that people only. Consequently, it was beyond the city and outside the walls, that you may learn it was a universal sacrifice, an oblation for the whole world, a cleansing for all."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, in his commentary on <a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse33">Matthew 27:33</a>, "someone explained 'the place of Calvary' as being the place where <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was buried; and that it was so called because the skull of the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was buried there. A pleasing interpretation indeed, and one suited to catch the ear of the people, but, still, not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> one. For the spots where the condemned are beheaded are outside the city and beyond the gates, deriving thence the name of Calvary--that is, of the beheaded. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, accordingly, was crucified there, that the standards of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> might be uplifted over what was formerly the place of the condemned. But <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was buried close by Hebron and Arbe, as we read in the book of <a href="../bible/jos000.htm">Jesus Ben Nave</a>." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was to be crucified in the common spot of the condemned rather than beside <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam's</a> sepulchre, to make it manifest that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> cross was the remedy, not only for <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam's</a> personal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but also for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the entire world.

<h2 id="article11">Article 11. Whether it was fitting for Christ to be crucified with thieves?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem unfitting for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to have been crucified with thieves, because it is written (<a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse14">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>): "What participation hath <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> with <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>?" But for our sakes <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> "of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is made unto us <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>" (<a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse30">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>); whereas <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> applies to thieves. Therefore it was not fitting for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be crucified with thieves.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, on <a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse35">Matthew 26:35</a>, "Though I should die with Thee, I will not deny Thee," <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> (Tract. xxxv in Matth.) observes: "It was not men's lot to die with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, since He died for all." Again, on <a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse33">Luke 22:33</a>, "I am ready to go with Thee, both into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> and death," <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> has followers, but not equals." It seems, then, much less fitting for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to suffer with thieves.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse44">Matthew 27:44</a>) that "the thieves who were crucified with Him reproached Him." But in <a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse42">Luke 22:42</a> it is stated that one of them who were crucified with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> cried out to Him: "Lord, remember me when Thou shalt come into Thy kingdom." It seems, then, that besides the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> thieves there was another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who did not <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> Him: and so the Evangelist's account does not seem to be accurate when it says that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was crucified with thieves.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It was foretold by Isaias (53:12): "And He was reputed with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was crucified between thieves from one <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> on the part of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, and from quite another on the part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> ordaining. As to the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> remarks (Hom. lxxxvii in Matth.) that they crucified the two thieves, one on either side, "that He might be made to share their guilt. But it did not happen so; because mention is never made of them; whereas His <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a> is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> everywhere. Kings lay aside their crowns to take up the cross: on their purple robes, on their diadems, on their weapons, on the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> table, everywhere the cross shines forth."

<p>As to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> ordinance, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was crucified with thieves, because, as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on <a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse33">Matthew 27:33</a>: "As <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> became <a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">accursed</a> of the cross for us, so for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> He was crucified as a guilty one among the guilty." Secondly, as Pope Leo observes (Serm. iv de Passione): "Two thieves were crucified, one on His right hand and one on His left, to set forth by the very appearance of the gibbet that separation of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> which shall be made in His hour of judgment." And <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> on <a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse36">John 7:36</a>: "The very cross, if thou mark it well, was a judgment-seat: for the judge being set in the midst, the one who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> was delivered, the other who mocked Him was condemned. Already He has signified what He shall do to the quick and the dead; some He will set on His right, others on His left hand." Thirdly, according to <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> (Comm. xxxiii in Matth.): "Two thieves are set, one upon His right and one upon His left, to show that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> is called to the sacrament of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. But because of the cleavage between believers and unbelievers, the multitude is divided into right and left, those on the right being saved by the justification of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>." Fourthly, because, as <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> says on <a href="../bible/mar015.htm#verse27">Mark 15:27</a>: "The thieves crucified with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> denote those who, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> in and confessing Christ, either endure the conflict of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> or keep the institutes of stricter observance. But those who do the like for the sake of everlasting <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> are denoted by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a> on the right; while others who do so for the sake of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> applause copy the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> and behavior of the one on the left."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Just as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to die, but willingly submitted to death so as to vanquish death by His power: so neither deserved He to be classed with thieves; but willed to be reputed with the ungodly that He might destroy ungodliness by His power. Accordingly, <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. lxxxiv in Joan.) that "to convert the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a> upon the cross, and lead him into paradise, was no less a wonder than to shake the rocks."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It was not fitting that anyone else should die with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> from the same <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> as Christ: hence <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> continues thus in the same passage: "All had been under <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and all required that another should die for them, not they for others."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Consensu Evang. iii): We can understand Matthew "as putting the plural for the singular" when he said "the thieves reproached Him." Or it may be said, with <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, that "at first both blasphemed Him, but afterwards one <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Him on witnessing the wonders."

<h2 id="article12">Article 12. Whether Christ's Passion is to be attributed to His Godhead?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> is to be attributed to His Godhead; for it is written (<a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse8">1 Corinthians 2:8</a>): "If they had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> it, they would never have crucified the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in respect of His Godhead. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> is attributed to Him in respect of His Godhead.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the principle of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is the Godhead Itself, according to <a href="../bible/psa036.htm#verse39">Psalm 36:39</a>: "But the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the just is from the Lord." Consequently, if <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> did not appertain to His Godhead, it would seem that it could not produce fruit in us.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> were punished for slaying Christ as for murdering <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself; as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the gravity of the punishment. Now this would not be so if the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> were not attributed to the Godhead. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> should be so attributed.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> says (Ep. ad Epict.): "The Word is impassible whose <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> is Divine." But what is impassible cannot suffer. Consequently, <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> did not concern His Godhead.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (2, 1,2,3,6), the union of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> with the Divine was effected in the Person, in the hypostasis, in the suppositum, yet observing the distinction of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>; so that it is the same Person and hypostasis of the Divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, while each <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> retains that which is proper to it. And therefore, as stated above (Question 16, Article 4), the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> is to be attributed to the suppositum of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, not because of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, which is impassible, but by reason of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence, in a Synodal Epistle of Cyril [Act. Conc. Ephes., P. i, cap. 26] we read: "If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not confess that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> suffered in the flesh and was crucified in the flesh, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> belongs to the "suppositum" of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> by reason of the passible <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> assumed, but not on account of the impassible Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is said to be crucified, not as the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, but as a man capable of suffering.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As is said in a sermon of the Council of Ephesus [P. iii, cap. 10, "Christ's death being, as it were, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> death"--namely, by union in Person--"destroyed death"; since He who suffered "was both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> was not wounded, nor did It undergo any change by those sufferings."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As the passage quoted goes on to say: "The <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> did not crucify one who was simply a man; they inflicted their presumptions upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For suppose a prince to speak by word of mouth, and that his words are committed to writing on a parchment and sent out to the cities, and that some rebel tears up the document, he will be led forth to endure the death sentence, not for merely tearing up a document, but as destroying the imperial message. Let not the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jew</a>, then, stand in security, as crucifying a mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; since what he saw was as the parchment, but what was hidden under it was the imperial Word, the Son by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, not the mere utterance of a tongue."
