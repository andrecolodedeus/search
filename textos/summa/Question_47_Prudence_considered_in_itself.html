<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether prudence is in the cognitive or in the appetitive faculty?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is not in the cognitive but in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> faculty. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Morib. Eccl. xv): "<a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">Prudence</a> is love choosing wisely between the things that help and those that hinder." Now love is not in the cognitive, but in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> faculty. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> faculty.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as appears from the foregoing definition it belongs to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> "to choose wisely." But choice is an act of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> faculty, as stated above (I-II, 13, 1). Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is not in the cognitive but in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> faculty.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vi, 5) that "in art it is better to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> than involuntarily, whereas in the case of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, as of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, it is worse." Now the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, of which he is treating there, are in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> faculty, whereas art is in the reason. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> rather than in the rational faculty.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. lxxxiii, qu. 61): "<a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">Prudence</a> is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of what to seek and what to avoid."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. x): "A <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is one who sees as it were from afar, for his sight is keen, and he foresees the event of uncertainties." Now sight belongs not to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> but to the cognitive faculty. Wherefore it is manifest that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> belongs directly to the cognitive, and not to the sensitive faculty, because by the latter we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing but what is within reach and offers itself to the senses: while to obtain <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the future from <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the present or past, which pertains to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, belongs properly to the reason, because this is done by a process of comparison. It follows therefore that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, properly speaking, is in the reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (I, 82, 4) the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> moves all the faculties to their acts. Now the first act of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> faculty is love, as stated above (I-II, 25, 1 and 2). Accordingly <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is said to be love, not indeed <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, but in so far as love moves to the act of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> goes on to say that "<a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is love discerning aright that which helps from that which hinders us in tending to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Now love is said to discern because it moves the reason to discern.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> considers things afar off, in so far as they tend to be a help or a hindrance to that which has to be done at the present time. Hence it is clear that those things which <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> considers stand in relation to this other, as in relation to the end. Now of those things that are directed to the end there is counsel in the reason, and choice in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, of which two, counsel belongs more properly to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. vi, 5,7,9) that a <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> "takes <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel." But as choice presupposes counsel, since it is "the desire for what has been already counselled" (Ethic. iii, 2), it follows that choice can also be ascribed to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> indirectly, in so far, to wit, as <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> directs the choice by means of counsel.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The worth of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> consists not in thought merely, but in its application to action, which is the end of the practical reason. Wherefore if any defect occur in this, it is most contrary to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, since, the end being of most import in everything, it follows that a defect which touches the end is the worst of all. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> goes on to say (Ethic. vi, 5) that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is "something more than a merely rational <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>," such as art is, since, as stated above (I-II, 57, 4) it includes application to action, which application is an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether prudence belongs to the practical reason alone or also to the speculative reason?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> belongs not only to the practical, but also to the speculative reason. For it is written (<a href="../bible/pro010.htm#verse23">Proverbs 10:23</a>): "Wisdom is <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> to a man." Now wisdom consists chiefly in <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> does also.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Offic. i, 24): "<a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">Prudence</a> is concerned with the quest of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and fills us with the desire of fuller <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>." Now this belongs to the speculative reason. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> resides also in the speculative reason.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> assigns art and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> to the same part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> (Ethic. vi, 1). Now art may be not only practical but also speculative, as in the case of the liberal arts. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> also is both practical and speculative.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vi, 5) that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is right reason applied to action. Now this belongs to none but the practical reason. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is in the practical reason only.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vi, 5) "a <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is one who is capable of taking <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel." Now counsel is about things that we have to do in relation to some end: and the reason that deals with things to be done for an end is the practical reason. Hence it is evident that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> resides only in the practical reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (45, 1 and 3), wisdom considers the absolutely highest <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: so that the consideration of the highest <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> in any particular genus belongs to wisdom in that genus. Now in the genus of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> the highest <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is the common end of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, and it is this end that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> intends. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vi, 5) that just as he who reasons well for the realization of a particular end, such as victory, is said to be <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>, not absolutely, but in a particular genus, namely warfare, so he that reasons well with regard to right conduct as a whole, is said to be <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> absolutely. Wherefore it is clear that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is wisdom about <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs: but not wisdom absolutely, because it is not about the absolutely highest <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, for it is about <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and this is not the best thing of all. And so it is stated significantly that "<a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is wisdom for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," but not wisdom absolutely.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a>, and Tully also (De Invent. ii, 53) take the word <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> in a broad sense for any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, whether speculative or practical. And yet it may also be replied that the act itself of the speculative reason, in so far as it is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, is a matter of choice and counsel as to its exercise; and consequently comes under the direction of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. On the other hand, as regards its specification in relation to its object which is the "<a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>," it comes under neither counsel nor <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Every application of right reason in the work of production belongs to art: but to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> belongs only the application of right reason in matters of counsel, which are those wherein there is no fixed way of obtaining the end, as stated in Ethic. iii, 3. Since then, the speculative reason makes things such as syllogisms, propositions and the like, wherein the process follows certain and fixed rules, consequently in respect of such things it is possible to have the essentials of art, but not of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>; and so we find such a thing as a speculative art, but not a speculative <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether prudence takes cognizance of singulars?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> does not take cognizance of singulars. For <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is in the reason, as stated above (1 and 2). But "reason deals with universals," according to Phys. i, 5. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> does not take cognizance except of universals.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, singulars are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in number. But the reason cannot comprehend an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of things. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> which is right reason, is not about singulars.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, particulars are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the senses. But <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is not in a sense, for many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who have keen outward senses are devoid of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> does not take cognizance of singulars.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vi, 7) that "<a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> does not deal with universals only, but needs to take cognizance of singulars also."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1, ad 3), to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> belongs not only the consideration of the reason, but also the application to action, which is the end of the practical reason. But no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can conveniently apply one thing to another, unless he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> both the thing to be applied, and the thing to which it has to be applied. Now actions are in singular matters: and so it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> both the universal principles of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, and the singulars about which actions are concerned.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason</a> first and chiefly is concerned with universals, and yet it is able to apply universal rules to particular cases: hence the conclusions of syllogisms are not only universal, but also particular, because the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> by a kind of reflection extends to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as stated in De Anima iii.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is because the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of singulars cannot be comprehended by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, that "our counsels are uncertain" (<a href="../bible/wis009.htm#verse14">Wisdom 9:14</a>). Nevertheless experience reduces the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> of singulars to a certain finite number which occur as a general rule, and the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of these suffices for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vi, 8), <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> does not reside in the external senses whereby we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> sensible objects, but in the interior sense, which is perfected by <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> and experience so as to judge promptly of particular cases. This does not mean however that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is in the interior sense as in its principle subject, for it is chiefly in the reason, yet by a kind of application it extends to this sense.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether prudence is a virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Lib. Arb. i, 13) that "<a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is the science of what to desire and what to avoid." Now science is condivided with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as appears in the Predicaments (vi). Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, there is no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: but "there is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of art," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. vi, 5): wherefore art is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now there is <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> in art, for it is written (<a href="../bible/2ch002.htm#verse14">2 Chronicles 2:14</a>) concerning Hiram, that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> "to grave all sort of graving, and to devise ingeniously [prudenter] all that there may be need of in the work." Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> can be immoderate. But <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is immoderate, else it would be useless to say (<a href="../bible/pro023.htm#verse4">Proverbs 23:4</a>): "Set bounds to thy <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> states (Moral. ii, 49) that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> are four <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (I-II, 55, 3; I-II, 56, 1) when we were treating of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in general, "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is that which makes its possessor <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and his work <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> likewise." Now <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> may be understood in a twofold sense: first, materially, for the thing that is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, secondly, formally, under the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Good, under the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, is the object of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power. Hence if any <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> rectify the consideration of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, without regarding the rectitude of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, they have less of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> since they direct <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> materially, that is to say, to the thing which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but without considering it under the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. On the other hand those <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which regard the rectitude of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, have more of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, because they consider the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> not only materially, but also formally, in other words, they consider that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> under the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p>Now it belongs to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, as stated above (1, ad 3; 3) to apply right reason to action, and this is not done without a right <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> not only as the other <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> have it, but also as the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> have it, among which <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> it is enumerated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> there takes science in the broad sense for any kind of right reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says that there is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of art, because art does not require rectitude of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; wherefore in order that a man may make right use of his art, he needs to have a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which will rectify his <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">Prudence</a> however has nothing to do with the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of art, because art is both directed to a particular end, and has fixed means of obtaining that end. And yet, by a kind of comparison, a man may be said to act prudently in matters of art. Moreover in certain arts, on account of the uncertainty of the means for obtaining the end, there is need for counsel, as for instance in the arts of medicine and navigation, as stated in Ethic. iii, 3.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This saying of the wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not mean that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> itself should be moderate, but that moderation must be imposed on other things according to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether prudence is a special virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For no special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is included in the definition of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in general, since <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is defined (Ethic. ii, 6) "an elective <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> that follows a mean appointed by reason in relation to ourselves, even as a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> decides." Now right reason is reason in accordance with <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, as stated in Ethic. vi, 13. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vi, 13) that "the effect of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is right action as regards the end, and that of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, right action as regards the means." Now in every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> certain things have to be done as means to the end. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is in every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and consequently is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> has a special object. But <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> has not a special object, for it is right reason "applied to action" (Ethic. vi, 5); and all works of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are actions. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is distinct from and numbered among the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, for it is written (<a href="../bible/wis008.htm#verse7">Wisdom 8:7</a>): "She teacheth <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since acts and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> take their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from their objects, as shown above (I-II, 01, 3; I-II, 18, 2; I-II, 54, 2), any <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> that has a corresponding special object, distinct from other objects, must needs be a special <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, and if it be a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, it must be a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now an object is called special, not merely according to the consideration of its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but rather according to its formal aspect, as explained above (I-II, 54, 2, ad 1). Because one and the same thing is the subject <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the acts of different <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, and also of different powers, according to its different formal aspects. Now a yet greater difference of object is requisite for a difference of powers than for a difference of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, since several <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are found in the same power, as stated above (I-II, 54, 1). Consequently any difference in the aspect of an object, that requires a difference of powers, will "a fortiori" require a difference of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>.

<p>Accordingly we must say that since <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is in the reason, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), it is differentiated from the other <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> by a material difference of objects. "Wisdom," "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>" and "understanding" are about <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> things, whereas "art" and "<a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>" are about contingent things, art being concerned with "things made," that is, with things produced in external <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, such as a house, a knife and so forth; and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, being concerned with "things done," that is, with things that have their being in the doer himself, as stated above (I-II, 57, 4). On the other hand <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is differentiated from the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> according to a formal aspect distinctive of powers, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> power, wherein is <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, wherein is moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Hence it is evident that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, distinct from all other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This is not a definition of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in general, but of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, the definition of which fittingly includes an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, viz., <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, which has the same <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in common with moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; because, just as the subject of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is something that partakes of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, so moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> has the aspect of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, in so far as it partakes of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument proves that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> helps all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and works in all of them; but this does not suffice to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that it is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; for nothing prevents a certain genus from containing a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> which is operative in every other <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of that same genus, even as the sun has an influence over all bodies.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Things done are indeed the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, in so far as they are the object of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, that is, considered as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: but they are the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, in so far as they are the object of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, that is, considered as <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether prudence appoints the end to moral virtues?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> appoints the end to moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Since <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is in the reason, while moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, it seems that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> stands in relation to moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as reason to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Now reason appoints the end to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> appoints the end to the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> surpasses irrational beings by his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, but he has other things in common with them. Accordingly the other parts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> are in relation to his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, what <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is in relation to irrational creatures. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is the end of irrational creatures, according to Polit. i, 3. Therefore all the other parts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> are directed to reason as to their end. But <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is "right reason applied to action," as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Therefore all actions are directed to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> as their end. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> appoints the end to all moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, art, or power that is concerned about the end, to command the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> or arts that are concerned about the means. Now <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> disposes of the other moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and commands them. Therefore it appoints their end to them.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vi, 12) that "moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> ensures the rectitude of the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the end, while <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> ensures the rectitude of the means." Therefore it does not belong to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> to appoint the end to moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, but only to regulate the means.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The end of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is to be in accord with reason, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> declares (Div. Nom. iv). Wherefore the ends of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> must of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the reason.

<p>Now, just as, in the speculative reason, there are certain things <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, about which is "understanding," and certain things of which we obtain <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> through them, viz. conclusions, about which is "science," so in the practical reason, certain things pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> principles, and such are the ends of the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, since the end is in practical matters what principles are in speculative matters, as stated above (23, 07, ad 2; I-II, 13, 3); while certain things are in the practical reason by way of conclusions, and such are the means which we gather from the ends themselves. About these is <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, which applies universal principles to the particular conclusions of practical matters. Consequently it does not belong to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> to appoint the end to moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, but only to regulate the means.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Natural reason <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the name of <a href="../cathen/14384a.htm">"synderesis"</a> appoints the end to moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as stated above (I, 79, 12): but <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> does not do this for the reason given above.

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the Second Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The end concerns the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, not as though they appointed the end, but because they tend to the end which is appointed by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. On this they are helped by <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, which prepares the way for them, by disposing the means. Hence it follows that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is more excellent than the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and moves them: yet <a href="../cathen/14384a.htm">"synderesis"</a> moves <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, just as the understanding of principles moves science.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether it belongs to prudence to find the mean in moral virtues?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it does not belong to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> to find the mean in moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For the achievement of the mean is the end of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. But <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> does not appoint the end to moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as shown above (<a href="#6">Article 6</a>). Therefore it does not find the mean in them.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which of itself has being, would seem to have no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but its very being is its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, since a thing is said to have being by reason of its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Now "to follow the mean" belongs to moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> by reason of itself, as part of its definition, as shown above (5, Objection 1). Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the mean in moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> works after the manner of reason. But moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> tends to the mean after the manner of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, because, as Tully states (De Invent. Rhet. ii, 53), "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> like a second <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in accord with reason." Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> does not appoint the mean to moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> In the foregoing definition of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> (5, Objection 1) it is stated that it "follows a mean appointed by reason . . . even as a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> decides."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The proper end of each moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> consists precisely in conformity with right reason. For <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> intends that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should not stray from reason for the sake of his <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a>; <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, that he should not stray from the right judgment of reason through fear or daring. Moreover this end is appointed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, since <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> dictates to each one that he should act according to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p>But it belongs to the ruling of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> to decide in what manner and by what means <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall obtain the mean of reason in his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. For though the attainment of the mean is the end of a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, yet this mean is found by the right disposition of these things that are directed to the end.

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> agent makes form to be in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, yet does not make that which is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the form to belong to it, so too, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> appoints the mean in <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and operations, and yet does not make the searching of the mean to belong to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> after the manner of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> intends to attain the mean. Since, however, the mean as such is not found in all matters after the same manner, it follows that the inclination of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which ever works in the same manner, does not suffice for this purpose, and so the ruling of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is required.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether command is the chief act of prudence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that command is not the chief act of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. For command regards the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to be ensued. Now <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. xiv, 9) states that it is an act of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> "to avoid ambushes." Therefore command is not the chief act of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vi, 5) that "the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> takes <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel." Now "to take counsel" and "to command" seem to be different acts, as appears from what has been said above (I-II, 57, 6). Therefore command is not the chief act of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it seems to belong to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to command and to rule, since the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> has the end for its object, and moves the other powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is not in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, but in the reason. Therefore command is not an act of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vi, 10) that "<a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> commands."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">Prudence</a> is "right reason applied to action," as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Hence that which is the chief <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> in regard to action must needs be the chief act of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Now there are three such acts. The first is "to take counsel," which belongs to discovery, for counsel is an act of inquiry, as stated above (I-II, 14, 1). The second act is "to judge of what one has discovered," and this is an act of the speculative reason. But the practical reason, which is directed to action, goes further, and its third act is "to command," which act consists in applying to action the things counselled and judged. And since this act approaches nearer to the end of the practical reason, it follows that it is the chief act of the practical reason, and consequently of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p>In confirmation of this we find that the perfection of art consists in judging and not in commanding: wherefore he who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> against his craft is reputed a better craftsman than he who does so involuntarily, because the former seems to do so from right judgment, and the latter from a defective judgment. On the other hand it is the reverse in <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, as stated in Ethic. vi, 5, for it is more imprudent to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>, since this is to be lacking in the chief act of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, viz. command, than to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> involuntarily.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The act of command extends both to the ensuing of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and to the avoidance of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Nevertheless <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> ascribes "the avoidance of ambushes" to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, not as its chief act, but as an act of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> that does not continue in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Good counsel is required in order that the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things discovered may be applied to action: wherefore command belongs to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> which takes <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Simply to move belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: but command denotes motion together with a kind of ordering, wherefore it is an act of the reason, as stated above (I-II, 17, 1).

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether solicitude belongs to prudence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that solicitude does not belong to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. For solicitude implies disquiet, wherefore <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. x) that "a solicitous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is a restless <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." Now motion belongs chiefly to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power: wherefore solicitude does also. But <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is not in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, but in the reason, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore solicitude does not belong to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> seems opposed to solicitude, wherefore it is related (<a href="../bible/1sa009.htm#verse20">1 Samuel 9:20</a>) that Samuel said to Saul: "As for the asses which were lost three days ago, be not solicitous, because they are found." Now the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, since it is an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore solicitude is in opposition to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> rather than belonging to it.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 3) the "magnanimous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is slow and leisurely." Now slowness is contrary to solicitude. Since then <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is not opposed to magnanimity, for "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is not opposed to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," as stated in the Predicaments (viii) it would seem that solicitude does not belong to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/1pe004.htm#verse7">1 Peter 4:7</a>): "Be <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> . . . and watch in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>." But watchfulness is the same as solicitude. Therefore solicitude belongs to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> (Etym. x), a man is said to be solicitous through being shrewd [solers] and alert [citus], in so far as a man through a certain shrewdness of mind is on the alert to do whatever has to be done. Now this belongs to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, whose chief act is a command about what has been already counselled and judged in matters of action. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vi, 9) that "one should be quick in carrying out the counsel taken, but slow in taking counsel." Hence it is that solicitude belongs properly to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and for this reason <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Morib. Eccl. xxiv) that "<a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> keeps most careful watch and ward, lest by degrees we be deceived unawares by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> counsel."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Movement belongs to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power as to the principle of movement, in accordance however, with the direction and command of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, wherein solicitude consists.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. i, 3), "equal <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> should not be sought in all things, but in each <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> according to its proper mode." And since the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is the contingent singulars about which are <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions, the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> cannot be so great as to be devoid of all solicitude.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The magnanimous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is said to be "slow and leisurely" not because he is solicitous about nothing, but because he is not over-solicitous about many things, and is trustful in matters where he ought to have trust, and is not over-solicitous about them: for over-much fear and distrust are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of over-solicitude, since fear makes us take counsel, as stated above (I-II, 44, 2) when we were treating of the passion of fear.

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether solicitude belongs to prudence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> does not extend to the governing of many, but only to the government of oneself. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. v, 1) that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> directed to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. But <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> differs from <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is not directed to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, he seems to be <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>, who seeks and does <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for himself. Now those who seek the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> often neglect their own. Therefore they are not <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is specifically distinct from <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. But <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> seem to be related only to a man's own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore the same applies to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse45">Matthew 24:45</a>): "Who, thinkest thou, is a faithful and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'wise'] servant whom his lord hath appointed over his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>?"

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vi, 8) some have held that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> does not extend to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but only to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, and this because they thought that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not bound to seek other than his own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But this opinion is opposed to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which "seeketh not her own" (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse5">1 Corinthians 13:5</a>): wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says of himself (<a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse33">1 Corinthians 10:33</a>): "Not seeking that which is profitable to myself, but to many, that they may be saved." Moreover it is contrary to right reason, which judges the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to be better than the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>.

<p>Accordingly, since it belongs to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> rightly to counsel, judge, and command concerning the means of obtaining a due end, it is evident that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> regards not only the private <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, but also the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the multitude.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> is speaking there of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now just as every moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that is directed to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is called "legal" <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, so the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> that is directed to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is called "political" <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, for the latter stands in the same relation to legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> simply so called to moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> He that seeks the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the many, seeks in consequence his own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, for two reasons. First, because the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is impossible without the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, state, or kingdom. Hence Valerius Maximus says [Fact. et Dict. Memor. iv, 6 of the ancient Romans that "they would rather be poor in a rich empire than rich in a poor empire." Secondly, because, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is a part of the home and state, he must needs consider what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for him by being <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> about the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the many. For the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> disposition of parts depends on their relation to the whole; thus <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. iii, 8) that "any part which does not harmonize with its whole, is offensive."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Even <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> can be directed to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, hence there are precepts of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> concerning them as stated in Ethic. v, 1: more so, however, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, since these belong to the rational faculty which directly regards the universal, just as the sensitive part regards singulars.

<h2 id="article11">Article 11. Whether prudence about one's own good is specifically the same as that which extends to the common good?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> about one's own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is the same specifically as that which extends to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vi, 8) that "political <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> are the same <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, yet their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is not the same."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Polit. iii, 2) that "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is the same in a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and in a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> ruler." Now political <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is chiefly in the ruler, in whom it is architectonic, as it were. Since then <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, it seems that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and political <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> are the same <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is not diversified in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> or <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> by things which are subordinate to one another. But the particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which belongs to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> simply so called, is subordinate to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which belongs to political <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and political <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> differ neither specifically nor <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> "Political <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>," which is directed to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the state, "domestic economy" which is of such things as relate to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the household or <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and "monastic economy" which is concerned with things affecting the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, are all distinct <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. Therefore in like manner there are different kinds of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, corresponding to the above differences of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (5; 54, 2, ad 1), the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> differ according to the difference of object considered in its formal aspect. Now the formal aspect of all things directed to the end, is taken from the end itself, as shown above (I-II, Prolog.; I-II, 102, 1), wherefore the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> differ by their relation to different ends. Again the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the city and kingdom are different ends. Wherefore there must needs be different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> corresponding to these different ends, so that one is "<a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>" simply so called, which is directed to one's own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; another, "domestic <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>" which is directed to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the home; and a third, "political <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>," which is directed to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the state or kingdom.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> means, not that political <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is substantially the same <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> as any kind of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, but that it is the same as the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> which is directed to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. This is called "<a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>" in respect of the common notion of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, i.e. as being right reason applied to action, while it is called "political," as being directed to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> declares (Polit. iii, 2), "it belongs to a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be able to rule well and to obey well," wherefore the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> includes also that of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> ruler. Yet the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the ruler and of the subject differs specifically, even as the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of a man and of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, as stated by the same authority (Polit. iii, 2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Even different ends, one of which is subordinate to the other, diversify the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, thus for instance, <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> directed to riding, soldiering, and civic life, differ specifically although their ends are subordinate to one another. On like manner, though the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> is subordinate to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the many, that does not prevent this difference from making the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> differ specifically; but it follows that the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> which is directed to the last end is above the other <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> and commands them.

<h2 id="article12">Article 12. Whether prudence is in subjects, or only in their rulers?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is not in subjects but only in their rulers. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Polit. iii, 2) that "<a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> alone is the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> proper to a ruler, while other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are common to subjects and rulers, and the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of the subject is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> but a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> opinion."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is stated in Polit. i, 5 that "a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> is not competent to take counsel." But <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> makes a man take <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel (Ethic. vi, 5). Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is not befitting slaves or subjects.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> exercises command, as stated above (<a href="#8">Article 8</a>). But command is not in the competency of slaves or subjects but only of rulers. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is not in subjects but only in rulers.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vi, 8) that there are two kinds of political <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, one of which is "legislative" and belongs to rulers, while the other "retains the common name political," and is about "<a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> actions." Now it belongs also to subjects to perform these <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> actions. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is not only in rulers but also in subjects.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">Prudence</a> is in the reason. Now ruling and governing belong properly to the reason; and therefore it is proper to a man to reason and be <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> in so far as he has a share in ruling and governing. But it is evident that the subject as subject, and the <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> as <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a>, are not competent to rule and govern, but rather to be ruled and governed. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> as <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a>, nor of a subject as subject.

<p>Since, however, every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, for as much as he is rational, has a share in ruling according to the judgment of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, he is proportionately competent to have <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Wherefore it is manifest that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is in the ruler "after the manner of a mastercraft" (Ethic. vi, 8), but in the subjects, "after the manner of a handicraft."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The saying of the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> is to be understood strictly, namely, that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of a subject as such.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> is not capable of taking counsel, in so far as he is a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> (for thus he is the instrument of his master), but he does take counsel in so far as he is a rational animal.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> By <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> a man commands not only others, but also himself, in so far as the reason is said to command the lower powers.

<h2 id="article13">Article 13. Whether prudence can be in sinners?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there can be <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> in sinners. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse8">Luke 16:8</a>): "The children of this world are more <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'wiser'] in their generation than the children of light." Now the children of this world are sinners. Therefore there be <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> in sinners.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is a more excellent <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. But there can be <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in sinners. Therefore there can be <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> also.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to Ethic. vi, 7, "we say that to be of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel is the work of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> especially." Now many sinners can take <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel. Therefore sinners can have <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> declares (Ethic. vi, 12) that "it is impossible for a man be <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> unless he be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." Now no inner is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore no sinner is <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">Prudence</a> is threefold. There is a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, which takes its name from its likeness to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. For since a <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is one who disposes well of the things that have to be done for a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> end, whoever disposes well of such things as are fitting for an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> end, has <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, in far as that which he takes for an end, is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, not in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> but in appearance. Thus <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is called "a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> robber," and in this way may speak of "a <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> robber," by way of similarity, because he devises fitting ways of committing robbery. This is the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of which the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse6">Romans 8:6</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'wisdom'] of the flesh is death," because, to wit, it places its ultimate end in the pleasures of the flesh.

<p>The second <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is indeed <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, because it devises fitting ways of obtaining a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> end; and yet it is imperfect, from a twofold source. First, because the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which it takes for an end, is not the common end of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, but of some particular affair; thus when a man devises fitting ways of conducting business or of sailing a ship, he is called a <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> businessman, or a <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> sailor; secondly, because he fails in the chief act of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, as when a man takes counsel aright, and forms a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> judgment, even about things concerning life as a whole, but fails to make an effective command.

<p>The third <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is both <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and perfect, for it takes counsel, judges and commands aright in respect of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> whole life: and this alone is <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> simply so-called, and cannot be in sinners, whereas the first <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is in sinners alone, while imperfect <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is common to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, especially that which is imperfect through being directed to a particular end, since that which is imperfect on account of a failing in the chief act, is only in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This saying of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> is to be understood of the first <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, wherefore it is not said that they are <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> absolutely, but that they are <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> in "their generation."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> consists not in conformity with the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> for certain right actions, but in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> alone. On the other hand <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> implies a relation to a right <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. First because its principles are the ends in matters of action; and of such ends one forms a right estimate through the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which rectify the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>: wherefore without the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> there is no <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, as shown above (I-II, 58, 5); secondly because <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> commands right actions, which does not happen unless the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> be right. Wherefore though <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> on account of its object is more excellent than <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, yet <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, by its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, is more opposed to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which arises from a disorder of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Sinners can take <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel for an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> end, or for some particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but they do not perfectly take <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel for the end of their whole life, since they do not carry that counsel into effect. Hence they lack <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> which is directed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> only; and yet in them, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vi, 12) there is "cleverness," [<em>deinotike</em>] i.e. <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> diligence which may be directed to both <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; or "cunning," [<em>panourgia</em>] which is directed only to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and which we have stated above, to be "<a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>" or "<a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of the flesh."

<h2 id="article14">Article 14. Whether prudence is in all who have grace?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is not in all who have <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">Prudence</a> requires diligence, that one may foresee aright what has to be done. But many who have <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> have not this diligence. Therefore not all who have <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> have <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is one who takes <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel, as stated above (8, Objection 2; 13, Objection 3). Yet many have <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> who do not take <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel, and need to be guided by the counsel of others. Therefore not all who have <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, have <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Topic. iii, 2) that "young people are not obviously <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>." Yet many young people have <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is not to be found in all who have <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> unless he be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>. Now no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> without <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, for <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. ii, 46) that "the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> at all unless they effect prudently what they desire to accomplish." Therefore all who have <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> have <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> must needs be connected together, so that whoever has one has all, as stated above (I-II, 65, 1). Now whoever has <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> has <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, so that he must needs have all the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and hence, since <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as shown above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>), he must, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, have <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> also.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Diligence is twofold: one is merely sufficient with regard to things <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; and such diligence is given to all who have <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, whom "His unction teacheth of all things" (<a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse27">1 John 2:27</a>). There is also another diligence which is more than sufficient, whereby a man is able to make provision both for himself and for others, not only in matters <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, but also in all things relating to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life; and such diligence as this is not in all who have <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Those who require to be guided by the counsel of others, are able, if they have <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, to take counsel for themselves in this point at least, that they require the counsel of others and can discern <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> counsel.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Acquired <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the exercise of acts, wherefore "its acquisition demands experience and time" (Ethic. ii, 1), hence it cannot be in the young, neither in <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> nor in act. On the other hand gratuitous <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by divine infusion. Wherefore, in children who have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> but have not come to the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, there is <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> as to <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> but not as to act, even as in idiots; whereas in those who have come to the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, it is also as to act, with regard to things <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. This by practice <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> increase, until it becomes perfect, even as the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb005.htm#verse14">Hebrews 5:14</a>) that "strong meat is for the perfect, for them who by custom have their senses exercised to the discerning of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>."

<h2 id="article15">Article 15. Whether prudence is in us by nature?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is in us by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says that things connected with <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> "seem to be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>," namely "synesis, gnome" [<em>synesis</em> and <em>gnome</em>, Cf. I-II, 57, 6 and the like, but not those which are connected with speculative wisdom. Now things belonging to the same genus have the same kind of origin. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> also is in us from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the changes of age are according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> results from age, according to <a href="../bible/job012.htm#verse12">Job 12:12</a>: "In the ancient is wisdom, and in length of days <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is more consistent with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> than with that of dumb animals. Now there are instances of a certain <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> in dumb animals, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Hist. Anim. viii, 1). Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 1) that "<a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is both originated and fostered by teaching; it therefore demands experience and time." Now <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is in us, not by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but by teaching and experience.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As shown above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> includes <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> both of universals, and of the singular matters of action to which <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> applies the universal principles. Accordingly, as regards the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of universals, the same is to be said of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> as of speculative science, because the primary universal principles of either are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, as shown above (<a href="#6">Article 6</a>): except that the common principles of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> are more connatural to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; for as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> remarks (Ethic. x, 7) "the life which is according to the speculative reason is better than that which is according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>": whereas the secondary universal principles, whether of the speculative or of the practical reason, are not inherited from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but are acquired by discovery through experience, or through teaching.

<p>On the other hand, as regards the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of particulars which are the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of action, we must make a further distinction, because this matter of action is either an end or the means to an end. Now the right ends of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life are fixed; wherefore there can be a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination in respect of these ends; thus it has been stated above (I-II, 51, 1; I-II, 63, 1) that some, from a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination, have certain <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> whereby they are inclined to right ends; and consequently they also have <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> a right judgment about such like ends.

<p>But the means to the end, in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> concerns, far from being fixed, are of manifold variety according to the variety of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and affairs. Wherefore since the inclination of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is ever to something fixed, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of those means cannot be in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, although, by reason of his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> disposition, one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has a greater aptitude than another in discerning them, just as it happens with regard to the conclusions of speculative <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. Since then <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is not about the ends, but about the means, as stated above (6; I-II, 57, 5), it follows that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is not from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> is speaking there of things relating to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, in so far as they are directed to ends. Wherefore he had said before (Ethic. vi, 5,11) that "they are the principles of the <em>ou heneka</em>" [Literally, 'for the sake of which' (are the means)], namely, the end; and so he does not mention <em>euboulia</em> among them, because it takes counsel about the means.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">Prudence</a> is rather in the old, not only because their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> disposition calms the movement of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, but also because of their long experience.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Even in dumb animals there are fixed ways of obtaining an end, wherefore we observe that all the animals of a same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> act in like manner. But this is impossible in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, on account of his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, which takes cognizance of universals, and consequently extends to an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> of singulars.

<h2 id="article16">Article 16. Whether prudence can be lost through forgetfulness?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> can be lost through forgetfulness. For since science is about <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> things, it is more <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> than <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> which is about contingent matters of action. But science is lost by forgetfulness. Much more therefore is <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 3) "the same things, but by a contrary process, engender and corrupt <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>." Now the engendering of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> requires experience which is made up "of many memories," as he states at the beginning of his Metaphysics (i, 1). Therefore since forgetfulness is contrary to <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, it seems that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> can be lost through forgetfulness.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, there is no <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of universals.

<p>But <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of universals can be lost through forgetfulness. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> can also.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vi, 5) that "forgetfulness is possible to art but not to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Forgetfulness regards <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> only, wherefore one can forget art and science, so as to lose them altogether, because they belong to the reason. But <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> consists not in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> alone, but also in an act of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, because as stated above (<a href="#8">Article 8</a>), its principal act is one of command, whereby a man applies the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> he has, to the purpose of appetition and operation. Hence <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is not taken away directly by forgetfulness, but rather is corrupted by the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vi, 5) that "pleasure and sorrow pervert the estimate of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>": wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/dan013.htm#verse56">Daniel 13:56</a>): "Beauty hath deceived thee, and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> hath subverted thy heart," and (<a href="../bible/exo023.htm#verse8">Exodus 23:8</a>): "Neither shalt thou take bribes which blind even the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'wise']."

<p>Nevertheless forgetfulness may hinder <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, in so far as the latter's command depends on <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which may be forgotten.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Science is in the reason only: hence the comparison fails, as stated above [Cf. I-II, 53, 1].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The experience required by <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> results not from <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> alone, but also from the practice of commanding aright.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">Prudence</a> consists chiefly, not in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of universals, but in applying them to action, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). Wherefore forgetting the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of universals does not destroy the principal part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, but hinders it somewhat, as stated above.
