<h1>Question 47. The cause that provokes anger, and the remedies of anger</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2047.htm#article1"> Is the motive of anger always something done against the one who is angry?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2047.htm#article2"> Is slight or contempt the sole motive of anger?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2047.htm#article3"> The cause of anger on the part of the angry person</a> <li><a href="../summa/2047.htm#article4"> The cause of anger on the part of the person with whom one is angry</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the motive of anger is always something done against the one who is angry?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the motive of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is not always something done against the one who is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>. Because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, can do nothing against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; since it is written (<a href="../bible/job035.htm#verse6">Job 35:6</a>): "If thy iniquities be multiplied, what shalt thou do against Him?" And yet <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is spoken of as being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> on account of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa105.htm#verse40">Psalm 105:40</a>: "The Lord was exceedingly <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with His people." Therefore it is not always on account of something done against him, that a man is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is a desire for vengeance. But one may desire vengeance for things done against others. Therefore we are not always <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> on account of something done against us.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 2) <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> especially with those "who despise what he takes a great interest in; thus men who study <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> are <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with those who despise <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>," and so forth. But contempt of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> does not harm the philosopher. Therefore it is not always a harm done to us that makes us <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, he that holds his tongue when another insults him, provokes him to greater <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> observes (Hom. xxii, in Ep. ad Rom.). But by holding his tongue he does the other no harm. Therefore a man is not always provoked to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> by something done against him.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 4) that "<a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is always due to something done to oneself: whereas <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> may arise without anything being done to us, for we <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> a man simply because we think him such."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 46, Article 6), <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is the desire to hurt another for the purpose of just vengeance. Now unless some injury has been done, there is no question of vengeance: nor does any injury provoke one to vengeance, but only that which is done to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who seeks vengeance: for just as everything <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> seeks its own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, so does it <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> repel its own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But injury done by anyone does not affect a man unless in some way it be something done against him. Consequently the motive of a man's <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is always something done against him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> We speak of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not as of a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> but as of judgment of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, inasmuch as He wills to take vengeance on <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Because the sinner, by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, cannot do <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> any actual harm: but so far as he himself is concerned, he acts against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in two ways. First, in so far as he despises <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His commandments. Secondly, in so far as he harms himself or another; which injury redounds to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> injured is an object of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> and protection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> If we are <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with those who harm others, and seek to be avenged on them, it is because those who are injured belong in some way to us: either by some kinship or friendship, or at least because of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> we have in common.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> When we take a very great interest in a thing, we look upon it as our own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; so that if anyone despise it, it seems as though we ourselves were despised and injured.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Silence provokes the insulter to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> when he thinks it is due to contempt, as though his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> were slighted: and a slight is an action.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the sole motive of anger is slight or contempt?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that slight or contempt is not the sole motive of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 16) that we are <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> "when we suffer, or think that we are suffering, an injury." But one may suffer an injury without being despised or slighted. Therefore a slight is not the only motive of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, desire for <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and grief for a slight belong to the same subject. But dumb animals do not desire <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. Therefore they are not grieved by being slighted. And yet "they are roused to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, when wounded," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 8). Therefore a slight is not the sole motive of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Rhet. ii, 2) gives many other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, for instance, "being forgotten by others; that others should rejoice in our misfortunes; that they should make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> our <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>; being hindered from doing as we like." Therefore being slighted is not the only motive for being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 2) that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is "a desire, with sorrow, for vengeance, on account of a seeming slight done unbecomingly."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> All the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> are reduced to slight. For slight is of three kinds, as stated in Rhet. ii, 2, viz. "contempt," "despiteful treatment," i.e. hindering one from doing one's will, and "insolence": and all motives of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> are reduced to these three. Two reasons may be assigned for this. First, because <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> seeks another's hurt as being a means of just vengeance: wherefore it seeks vengeance in so far as it seems just. Now just vengeance is taken only for that which is done <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>; hence that which provokes <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is always something considered in the light of an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 3) that "men are not <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>--if they think they have wronged some one and are suffering <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> on that account; because there is no <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> at what is just." Now injury is done to another in three ways: namely, through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, through passion, and through choice. Then, most of all, a man does an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, when he does an injury from choice, on purpose, or from deliberate <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, as stated in Ethic. v, 8. Wherefore we are most of all <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with those who, in our opinion, have hurt us on purpose. For if we think that some one has done us an injury through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or through passion, either we are not <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with them at all, or very much less: since to do anything through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or through passion takes away from the notion of injury, and to a certain extent calls for mercy and forgiveness. Those, on the other hand, who do an injury on purpose, seem to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from contempt; wherefore we are <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with them most of all. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 3) that "we are either not <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> at all, or not very <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with those who have acted through <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, because they do not seem to have acted slightingly."

<p>The second reason is because a slight is opposed to a man's excellence: because "men think little of things that are not worth much ado" (Rhet. ii, 2). Now we seek for some kind of excellence from all our goods. Consequently whatever injury is inflicted on us, in so far as it is derogatory to our excellence, seems to savor of a slight.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Any other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, besides contempt, through which a man suffers an injury, takes away from the notion of injury: contempt or slight alone adds to the motive of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and consequently is of itself the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although a dumb animal does not seek <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> as such, yet it <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> seeks a certain superiority, and is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with anything derogatory thereto.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Each of those <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> amounts to some kind of slight. Thus forgetfulness is a clear sign of slight esteem, for the more we think of a thing the more is it fixed in our <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>. Again if a man does not hesitate by his remarks to give pain to another, this seems to show that he thinks little of him: and those too who show signs of hilarity when another is in misfortune, seem to care little about his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Again he that hinders another from carrying out his will, without deriving thereby any profit to himself, seems not to care much for his friendship. Consequently all those things, in so far as they are signs of contempt, provoke <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether a man's excellence is the cause of his being angry?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a man's excellence is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of his being more easily <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 2) that "some are <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> especially when they are grieved, for instance, the sick, the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and those who are disappointed." But these things seem to pertain to defect. Therefore defect rather than excellence makes one prone to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 2) that "some are very much inclined to be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> when they are despised for some failing or weakness of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of which there are grounds for suspicion; but if they think they excel in those points, they do not trouble." But a suspicion of this kind is due to some defect. Therefore defect rather than excellence is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a man being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whatever savors of excellence makes a man agreeable and hopeful. But the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 3) that "men are not <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> when they play, make jokes, or take part in a feast, nor when they are prosperous or successful, nor in moderate pleasures and well-founded hope." Therefore excellence is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 9) that excellence makes men prone to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, may be taken in two ways. First in respect of the motive of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>: and thus excellence is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a man being easily angered. Because the motive of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> slight, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Now it is evident that the more excellent a man is, the more <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> is a slight offered him in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in which he excels. Consequently those who excel in any <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, are most of all <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, if they be slighted in that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; for instance, a wealthy <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in his <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, or an orator in his eloquence, and so forth.

<p>Secondly, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, may be considered on the part of the disposition produced in him by the motive aforesaid. Now it is evident that nothing moves a man to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> except a hurt that grieves him: while whatever savors of defect is above all a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of grief; since men who suffer from some defect are more easily hurt. And this is why men who are weak, or subject to some other defect, are more easily angered, since they are more easily grieved.

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> If a man be despised in a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in which he evidently excels greatly, he does not consider himself the loser thereby, and therefore is not grieved: and in this respect he is less angered. But in another respect, in so far as he is more undeservedly despised, he has more reason for being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>: unless perhaps he thinks that he is envied or insulted not through contempt but through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, or some other like <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> All these things hinder <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> in so far as they hinder sorrow. But in another respect they are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> apt to provoke <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, because they make it more unseemly to insult anyone.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether a person's defect is a reason for being more easily angry with him?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> defect is not a reason for being more easily <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with him. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 3) that "we are not <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with those who confess and repent and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> themselves; on the contrary, we are gentle with them. Wherefore dogs bite not those who sit down." But these things savor of littleness and defect. Therefore littleness of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is a reason for being less <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with him.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, there is no greater defect than death. But <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> ceases at the sight of death. Therefore defect of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> does not provoke <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> against him.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no one thinks little of a man through his being friendly towards him. But we are more <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with friends, if they offend us or refuse to help us; hence it is written (<a href="../bible/psa054.htm#verse13">Psalm 54:13</a>): "If my enemy had reviled me I would verily have borne with it." Therefore a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> defect is not a reason for being more easily <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with him.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 2) that "the rich <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with the poor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, if the latter despise him; and in like manner the prince is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with his subject."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (2,3) unmerited contempt more than anything else is a provocative of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. Consequently deficiency or littleness in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> with whom we are <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, tends to increase our <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, in so far as it adds to the unmeritedness of being despised. For just as the higher a man's position is, the more undeservedly he is despised; so the lower it is, the less reason he has for despising. Thus a nobleman is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> if he be insulted by a peasant; a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, if by a fool; a master, if by a servant.

<p>If, however, the littleness or deficiency lessens the unmerited contempt, then it does not increase but lessens <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. In this way those who repent of their ill-deeds, and confess that they have done wrong, who <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> themselves and ask pardon, mitigate <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, according to <a href="../bible/pro015.htm#verse1">Proverbs 15:1</a>: "A mild answer breaketh wrath": because, to wit, they seem not to despise, but rather to think much of those before whom they <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> themselves.

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> There are two reasons why <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> ceases at the sight of death. One is because the dead are incapable of sorrow and sensation; and this is chiefly what the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> seek in those with whom they are angered. Another reason is because the dead seem to have attained to the limit of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> ceases in regard to all who are grievously hurt, in so far as this hurt surpasses the measure of just retaliation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> To be despised by one's friends seems also a greater indignity. Consequently if they despise us by hurting or by failing to help, we are <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with them for the same reason for which we are <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with those who are beneath us.
