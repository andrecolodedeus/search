<h1>Question 47. The distinction of things in general</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1047.htm#article1"> The multitude or distinction of things</a> <li><a href="../summa/1047.htm#article2"> Their inequality</a> <li><a href="../summa/1047.htm#article3"> The unity of the world</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the multitude and distinction of things come from God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the multitude and distinction of things does not come from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For one <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> always makes one. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is supremely one, as appears from what precedes (11, 4). Therefore He produces but one effect.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the representation is assimilated to its exemplar. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the exemplar <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of His effect, as was said above (Question 44, Article 3). Therefore, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is one, His effect is one only, and not diverse.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the means are proportional to the end. But the end of the creation is one--viz. the divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, as was shown above (44, 4). Therefore the effect of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is but one.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse4">Genesis 1:4-7</a>) that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "divided the light from the darkness," and "divided waters from waters." Therefore the distinction and multitude of things is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The distinction of things has been ascribed to many <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. For some attributed the distinction to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, either by itself or with the agent. Democritus, for instance, and all the ancient <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, who admitted no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> but <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, attributed it to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> alone; and in their opinion the distinction of things comes from chance according to the movement of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Anaxagoras, however, attributed the distinction and multitude of things to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and to the agent together; and he said that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> distinguishes things by extracting what is mixed up in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p>But this cannot stand, for two reasons.

<p>First, because, as was shown above (Question 44, Article 2), even <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> itself was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence we must reduce whatever distinction comes from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to a higher <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p>Secondly, because <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is for the sake of the form, and not the form for the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and the distinction of things comes from their proper forms. Therefore the distinction of things is not on account of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; but rather, on the contrary, <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is formless, in order that it may be accommodated to different forms.

<p>Others have attributed the distinction of things to secondary agents, as did <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a>, who said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by understanding Himself, produced the first <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>; in which, forasmuch as it was not its own being, there is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> composition of <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> and act, as will appear later (50, 3). And so the first <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>, inasmuch as it understood the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, produced the second <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>; and in so far as it understood itself as in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> it produced the heavenly body, which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> movement, and inasmuch as it understood itself as having <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a> it produced the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the heavens.

<p>But this opinion cannot stand, for two reasons. First, because it was shown above (Question 45, Article 5) that to create belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, and hence what can be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> only by creation is produced by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone--viz. all those things which are not subject to generation and corruption. Secondly, because, according to this opinion, the universality of things would not proceed from the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the first agent, but from the concurrence of many active <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>; and such an effect we can describe only as being produced by chance. Therefore, the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, which consists of the diversity of things, would thus be a thing of chance, which is impossible.

<p>Hence we must say that the distinction and multitude of things come from the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the first agent, who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For He brought things into being in order that His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> might be communicated to creatures, and be represented by them; and because His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> could not be adequately represented by one creature alone, He produced many and diverse creatures, that what was wanting to one in the representation of the divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> might be supplied by another. For <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, which in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is simple and uniform, in creatures is manifold and divided and hence the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> together participates the divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> more perfectly, and represents it better than any single creature whatever.

<p>And because the divine wisdom is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the distinction of things, therefore <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said that things are made distinct by the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is the concept of His wisdom; and this is what we read in <a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse3">Genesis 1:3-4</a>: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> said: Be light made . . . And He divided the light from the darkness."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> agent acts by the form which makes it what it is, and which is only one in one thing; and therefore its effect is one only. But the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> agent, such as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is, as was shown above (Question 19, Article 4), acts by an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> form. Since, therefore, it is not against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> unity and simplicity to understand many things, as was shown above (Question 15, Article 2), it follows that, although He is one, He can make many things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This reason would apply to the representation which reflects the exemplar perfectly, and which is multiplied by reason of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> only; hence the uncreated image, which is perfect, is only one. But no creature represents the first exemplar perfectly, which is the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; and, therefore, it can be represented by many things. Still, according as <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> are called exemplars, the plurality of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> corresponds in the divine mind to the plurality of things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In speculative things the medium of demonstration, which demonstrates the conclusion perfectly, is one only; whereas probable means of <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> are many. Likewise when operation is concerned, if the means be equal, so to speak, to the end, one only is sufficient. But the creature is not such a means to its end, which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and hence the multiplication of creatures is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the inequality of things is from God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the inequality of things is not from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For it belongs to the best to produce the best. But among things that are best, one is not greater than another. Therefore, it belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is the Best, to make all things equal.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, equality is the effect of unity (Metaph. v, text 20). But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is one. Therefore, He has made all things equal.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is the part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to give unequal to unequal things. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is just in all His works. Since, therefore, no inequality of things is presupposed to the operation whereby He gives being to things, it seems that He has made all things equal.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/sir033.htm#verse7">Sirach 33:7</a>): "Why does one day excel another, and one light another, and one year another year, one sun another sun? [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'when all come of the sun']. By the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Lord they were distinguished."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> When <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> wished to refute those who said that the distinction of things arose from the contrary principles of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, he said that in the beginning all things were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> equal by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For he asserted that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> first <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> only the rational creatures and all equal; and that inequality arose in them from <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, some being turned to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more and some less, and others turned more and others less away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And so those rational creatures which were turned to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, were promoted to the order of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> according to the diversity of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>. And those who were turned away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> were bound down to bodies according to the diversity of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and he said this was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the creation and diversity of bodies. But according to this opinion, it would follow that the universality of bodily creatures would not be the effect of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as communicated to creatures, but it would be for the sake of the punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is contrary to what is said: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> saw all the things that He had made, and they were very <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse31">Genesis 1:31</a>). And, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei ii, 3): "What can be more foolish than to say that the divine Architect provided this one sun for the one world, not to be an ornament to its beauty, nor for the benefit of corporeal things, but that it happened through the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; so that, if a hundred <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, there would be a hundred suns in the world?"

<p>Therefore it must be said that as the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the distinction of things, so the same wisdom is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of their inequality. This may be explained as follows. A twofold distinction is found in things; one is a formal distinction as regards things differing specifically; the other is a material distinction as regards things differing numerically only. And as the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is on account of the form, material distinction <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> for the sake of the formal distinction. Hence we see that in incorruptible things there is only one <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> of each <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, forasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is sufficiently preserved in the one; whereas in things generated and corruptible there are many <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> of one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> for the preservation of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Whence it appears that formal distinction is of greater consequence than material. Now, formal distinction always requires inequality, because as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. viii, 10), the forms of things are like numbers in which <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> vary by addition or subtraction of unity. Hence in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> seem to be arranged in degrees; as the mixed things are more perfect than the elements, and plants than minerals, and animals than plants, and men than other animals; and in each of these one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is more perfect than others. Therefore, as the divine wisdom is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the distinction of things for the sake of the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, so it is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of inequality. For the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> would not be perfect if only one grade of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> were found in things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is part of the best agent to produce an effect which is best in its entirety; but this does not mean that He makes every part of the whole the best absolutely, but in proportion to the whole; in the case of an animal, for instance, its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> would be taken away if every part of it had the dignity of an eye. Thus, therefore, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> also made the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> to be best as a whole, according to the mode of a creature; whereas He did not make each single creature best, but one better than another. And therefore we find it said of each creature, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> saw the light that it was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse4">Genesis 1:4</a>); and in like manner of each one of the rest. But of all together it is said, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> saw all the things that He had made, and they were very <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse31">Genesis 1:31</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The first effect of unity is equality; and then comes multiplicity; and therefore from the Father, to Whom, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Doctr. Christ. i, 5), is appropriated unity, the Son proceeds to Whom is appropriated equality, and then from Him the creature proceeds, to which belongs inequality; but nevertheless even creatures share in a certain equality--namely, of proportion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This is the argument that persuaded <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>: but it holds only as regards the distribution of rewards, the inequality of which is due to unequal <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>. But in the constitution of things there is no inequality of parts through any preceding inequality, either of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> or of the disposition of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; but inequality comes from the perfection of the whole. This appears also in works done by art; for the roof of a house differs from the foundation, not because it is made of other material; but in order that the house may be made perfect of different parts, the artificer seeks different material; indeed, he would make such material if he could.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether there is only one world?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is not only one world, but many. Because, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. 83, qu. 46), it is unfitting to say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things without a reason. But for the same reason He <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> one, He could create many, since His power is not limited to the creation of one world; but rather it is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, as was shown above (Question 25, Article 2). Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has produced many worlds.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> does what is best and much more does <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But it is better for there to be many worlds than one, because many <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things are better than a few. Therefore many worlds have been made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, everything which has a form in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> can be multiplied in number, the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> remaining the same, because multiplication in number comes from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But the world has a form in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Thus as when I say "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" I mean the form, and when I say "this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," I mean the form in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; so when we say "world," the form is signified, and when we say "this world," the form in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is signified. Therefore there is nothing to prevent the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of many worlds.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse10">John 1:10</a>): "The world was made by Him," where the world is named as one, as if only one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The very order of things <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shows the unity of the world. For this world is called one by the unity of order, whereby some things are ordered to others. But whatever things come from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, have relation of order to each other, and to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, as shown above (11, 3; 21, 1). Hence it must be that all things should belong to one world. Therefore those only can assert that many worlds <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> who do not acknowledge any ordaining wisdom, but rather <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in chance, as Democritus, who said that this world, besides an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of other worlds, was made from a casual concourse of atoms.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This reason proves that the world is one because all things must be arranged in one order, and to one end. Therefore from the unity of order in things <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> infers (Metaph. xii, text 52) the unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> governing all; and <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> (Tim.), from the unity of the exemplar, proves the unity of the world, as the thing designed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> No agent intends material plurality as the end forasmuch as material multitude has no certain limit, but of itself tends to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> is opposed to the notion of end. Now when it is said that many worlds are better than one, this has reference to material order. But the best in this sense is not the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the divine agent; forasmuch as for the same reason it might be said that if He had made two worlds, it would be better if He had made three; and so on to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The world is composed of the whole of its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. For it is not possible for there to be another earth than this one, since every earth would <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> be carried to this central one, wherever it was. The same applies to the other bodies which are part of the world.
