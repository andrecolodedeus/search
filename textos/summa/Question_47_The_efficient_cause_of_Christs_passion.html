<h1>Question 47. The efficient cause of Christ's passion</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/4047.htm#article1"> Was Christ slain by others, or by Himself?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4047.htm#article2"> From what motive did He deliver Himself up to the Passion?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4047.htm#article3"> Did the Father deliver Him up to suffer?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4047.htm#article4"> Was it fitting that He should suffer at the hands of the Gentiles, or rather of the Jews?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4047.htm#article5"> Did His slayers know who He was?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4047.htm#article6"> The sin of them who slew Christ</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether Christ was slain by another or by Himself?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not slain by another, but by Himself. For He says Himself (<a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse18">John 10:18</a>): "No men taketh My life from Me, but I lay it down of Myself." But he is said to kill another who takes away his life. Consequently, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not slain by others, but by Himself.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, those slain by others sink gradually from exhausted <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and this is strikingly apparent in the crucified: for, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iv): "Those who were crucified were tormented with a lingering death." But this did not happen in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> case, since "crying out, with a loud voice, He yielded up the ghost" (<a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse50">Matthew 27:50</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not slain by others, but by Himself.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, those slain by others suffer a <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> death, and hence die unwillingly, because <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> is opposed to <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. But <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iv): "Christ's spirit did not quit the flesh unwillingly, but because He willed it, when He willed it, and as He willed it." Consequently <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not slain by others, but by Himself.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse33">Luke 18:33</a>): "After they have scourged Him, they will put him to death."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing may <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> an effect in two ways: in the first instance by acting directly so as to produce the effect; and in this manner <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> persecutors slew Him because they inflicted on Him what was a sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of death, and with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of slaying Him, and the effect followed, since death resulted from that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. In another way someone <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> an effect indirectly--that is, by not preventing it when he can do so; just as one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is said to drench another by not closing the window through which the shower is entering: and in this way <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of His own <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> and death. For He could have prevented His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> and death. Firstly, by holding His enemies in check, so that they would not have been eager to slay Him, or would have been powerless to do so. Secondly, because His spirit had the power of preserving His fleshly <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> from the infliction of any injury; and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> had this power, because it was united in unity of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> with the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Divine Word</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iv). Therefore, since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> did not repel the injury inflicted on His body, but willed His corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to succumb to such injury, He is said to have laid down His life, or to have died <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> When we hear the words, "No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> taketh away My life from Me," we must understand "against My will": for that is properly said to be "taken away" which one takes from someone who is unwilling and unable to resist.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In order for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to show that the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> inflicted by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> did not take away His life, He preserved the strength of His bodily <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, so that at the last moment He was able to cry out with a loud voice: and hence His death should be computed among His other <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. Accordingly it is written (<a href="../bible/mar015.htm#verse39">Mark 15:39</a>): "And the centurion who stood over against Him, seeing that crying out in this manner, He had given up the ghost, said: Indeed, this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>." It was also a subject of wonder in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death that He died sooner than the others who were tormented with the same suffering. Hence John says (19:32) that "they broke the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified with Him," that they might die more speedily; "but after they were come to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, when they saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs." Mark also states (15:44) that "<a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> wondered that He should be already dead." For as of His own will His bodily <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> kept its vigor to the end, so likewise, when He willed, He suddenly succumbed to the injury inflicted.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> at the same time suffered <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> in order to die, and died, nevertheless, <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>; because <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> was inflicted on His body, which, however, prevailed over His body only so far as He willed it.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether Christ died out of obedience?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not die out of obedience. For obedience is referred to a command. But we do not read that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was commanded to suffer. Therefore He did not suffer out of obedience.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a man is said to do from obedience what he does from <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of precept. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not suffer <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a>, but <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>. Therefore He did not suffer out of obedience.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is a more excellent <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than obedience. But we read that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> suffered out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, according to <a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse2">Ephesians 5:2</a>: "Walk in love, as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> also has loved us, and delivered Himself up for us." Therefore <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> ought to be ascribed rather to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> than to obedience.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse8">Philippians 2:8</a>): "He became obedient" to the Father "unto death."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It was befitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should suffer out of obedience. First of all, because it was in keeping with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>, that "as by the disobedience of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, many were made sinners: so also by the obedience of one, many shall be made <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>," as is written <a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse19">Romans 5:19</a>. Secondly, it was suitable for reconciling <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: hence it is written (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse10">Romans 5:10</a>): "We are reconciled to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the death of His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>," in so far as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death was a most acceptable sacrifice to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse2">Ephesians 5:2</a>: "He delivered Himself for us an oblation and a sacrifice to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for an odor of sweetness." Now obedience is preferred to all <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. according to <a href="../bible/1sa015.htm#verse22">1 Samuel 15:22</a>: "Obedience is better than <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>." Therefore it was fitting that the sacrifice of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> and death should proceed from obedience. Thirdly, it was in keeping with His victory whereby He triumphed over death and its author; because a soldier cannot conquer unless he obey his captain. And so the Man-Christ secured the victory through being obedient to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/pro021.htm#verse28">Proverbs 21:28</a>: "An obedient <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall speak of victory."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> received a command from the Father to suffer. For it is written (<a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse18">John 10:18</a>): "I have power to lay down My life, and I have power to take it up again: (and) this commandment have I received of My Father"--namely, of laying down His life and of resuming it again. "From which," as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. lix in Joan.), it is not to be understood "that at first He awaited the command, and that He had need to be told, but He showed the proceeding to be a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> one, and destroyed suspicion of opposition" to the Father. Yet because the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was ended by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death, according to His dying words, "It is consummated" (<a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse30">John 19:30</a>), it may be understood that by His suffering He fulfilled all the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. He fulfilled those of the moral order which are founded on the precepts of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, inasmuch as He suffered both out of love of the Father, according to <a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse31">John 14:31</a>: "That the world may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I love the Father, and as the Father hath given Me commandment, so do I: arise, let us go hence"--namely, to the place of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>: and out of love of His neighbor, according to <a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse20">Galatians 2:20</a>: "He loved me, and delivered Himself up for me." <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> likewise by His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> fulfilled the ceremonial precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, which are chiefly ordained for <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and oblations, in so far as all the ancient <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> were figures of that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sacrifice which the dying Christ offered for us. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse16">Colossians 2:16-17</a>): "Let no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> judge you in meat or drink, or in respect of a festival day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the body is Christ's," for the reason that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is compared to them as a body is to a shadow. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> also by His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> fulfilled the judicial precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, which are chiefly ordained for making compensation to them who have suffered wrong, since, as is written <a href="../bible/psa068.htm#verse5">Psalm 68:5</a>: He "paid that which" He "took not away," suffering Himself to be fastened to a tree on account of the apple which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had plucked from the tree against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> command.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although obedience implies <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> with regard to the thing commanded, nevertheless it implies <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> with regard to the fulfilling of the precept. And, indeed, such was Christ's obedience, for, although His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> and death, considered in themselves, were repugnant to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> will, yet <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> resolved to fulfill <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will with respect to the same, according to <a href="../bible/psa039.htm#verse9">Psalm 39:9</a>: "That I should do Thy will: O my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I have desired it." Hence He said (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse42">Matthew 26:42</a>): "If this <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> may not pass away, but I must drink it, Thy will be done."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> For the same reason <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> suffered out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and out of obedience; because He fulfilled even the precepts of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> out of obedience only; and was obedient, out of love, to the Father's command.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether God the Father delivered up Christ to the Passion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father did not deliver up <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. For it is a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and cruel act to hand over an innocent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to torment and death. But, as it is written (<a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse4">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is faithful, and without any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>." Therefore He did not hand over the innocent <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> and death.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is not likely that a man be given over to death by himself and by another also. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> gave Himself up for us, as it is written (<a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse12">Isaiah 53:12</a>): "He hath delivered His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> unto death." Consequently it does not appear that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father delivered Him up.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> is held to be guilty because he betrayed <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse71">John 6:71</a>: "One of you is a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>," alluding to <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a>, who was to betray Him. The <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> are likewise reviled for delivering Him up to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>; as we read in <a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse35">John 18:35</a>: "Thy own nation, and the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> have delivered Thee up to me." Moreover, as is related in <a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse16">John 19:16</a>: <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> "delivered Him to them to be crucified"; and according to <a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse14">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>: there is no "participation of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> with <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>." It seems, therefore, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father did not deliver up <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse32">Romans 8:32</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath not spared His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As observed above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> suffered <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> out of obedience to the Father. Hence in three respects <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father did deliver up <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. In the first way, because by His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> will He preordained <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> for the deliverance of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, according to the words of Isaias (53:6): "The Lord hath laid on Him the iniquities of us all"; and again (<a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse10">Isaiah 53:10</a>): "The Lord was pleased to bruise Him in infirmity." Secondly, inasmuch as, by the infusion of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, He inspired Him with the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to suffer for us; hence we read in the same passage: "He was offered because it was His own will" (<a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse7">Isaiah 53:7</a>). Thirdly, by not shielding Him from the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, but abandoning Him to His persecutors: thus we read (<a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse46">Matthew 27:46</a>) that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, while hanging upon the cross, cried out: "My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, why hast Thou forsaken Me?" because, to wit, He left Him to the power of His persecutors, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. cxl).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is indeed a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and cruel act to hand over an innocent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to torment and to death against his will. Yet <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father did not so deliver up <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but inspired Him with the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to suffer for us. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> "severity" (cf. <a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse22">Romans 11:22</a>) is thereby shown, for He would not remit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> without penalty: and the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> indicates this when (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse32">Romans 8:32</a>) he says: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> spared not even His own Son." Likewise His "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse22">Romans 11:22</a>) shines forth, since by no penalty endured could <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> pay Him enough satisfaction: and the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> denotes this when he says: "He delivered Him up for us all": and, again (<a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse25">Romans 3:25</a>): "Whom"--that is to say, Christ--<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "hath proposed to be a propitiation through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in His blood."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> delivered Himself up to death by the same will and action as that by which the Father delivered Him up; but as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> He gave Himself up by a will inspired of the Father. Consequently there is no contrariety in the Father delivering Him up and in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> delivering Himself up.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The same act, for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, is judged differently, accordingly as it proceeds from a different source. The Father delivered up <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> surrendered Himself, from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and consequently we give praise to both: but <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> betrayed <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> from greed, the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> from <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> from worldly fear, for he stood in fear of Caesar; and these accordingly are held guilty.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether it was fitting for Christ to suffer at the hands of the Gentiles?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem unfitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should suffer at the hands of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. For since men were to be freed from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death, it would seem fitting that very few should <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in His death. But the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in His death, on whose behalf it is said (<a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse38">Matthew 21:38</a>): "This is the heir; come, let us kill him." It seems fitting, therefore, that the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> should not be implicated in the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> slaying.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> should respond to the figure. Now it was not the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> but the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> who offered the figurative <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. Therefore neither ought <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, which was a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sacrifice, to be fulfilled at the hands of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as related <a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse18">John 5:18</a>, "the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> sought to kill" <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> because "He did not only break the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>, but also said <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was His Father, making Himself equal to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." But these things seemed to be only against the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>: hence they themselves said (<a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse7">John 19:7</a>): "According to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> He ought to die because He made Himself the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>." It seems fitting, therefore, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should suffer, at the hands not of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, but of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, and that what they said was <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>: "It is not lawful for us to put any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to death," since many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are punishable with death according to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, as is evident from <a href="../bible/lev020.htm">Leviticus 20</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> Himself says (<a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse19">Matthew 20:19</a>): "They shall deliver Him to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to be mocked, and scourged, and crucified."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The effect of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> was foreshown by the very manner of His death. For <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> wrought its effect of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> first of all among the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, very many of whom were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in His death, as is evident from <a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse41">Acts 2:41</a> and <a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse4">Acts 4:4</a>. Afterwards, by the preaching of <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> passed on to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. Consequently it was fitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should begin His sufferings at the hands of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, and, after they had delivered Him up, finish His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> at the hands of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In order to demonstrate the fulness of His love, on account of which He suffered, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> upon the cross <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for His persecutors. Therefore, that the fruits of His petition might accrue to <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, Christ willed to suffer from both.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> was the offering of a sacrifice, inasmuch as He endured death of His own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: but in so far as He suffered from His persecutors it was not a sacrifice, but a most grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. cxiv in Joan.): "The <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> said that 'it is not lawful for us to put any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to death,' because they understood that it was not lawful for them to put any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to death" owing to the sacredness of the feast-day, which they had already begun to celebrate. or, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> observes (Hom. lxxxiii in Joan.), because they wanted Him to be slain, not as a transgressor of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, but as a public enemy, since He had made Himself out to be a king, of which it was not their place to judge. Or, again, because it was not lawful for them to crucify Him (as they wanted to), but to stone Him, as they did to Stephen. Better still is it to say that the power of putting to death was taken from them by the Romans, whose subjects they were.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether Christ's persecutors knew who He was?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> persecutors did <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> who He was. For it is written (<a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse38">Matthew 21:38</a>) that the husbandmen seeing the son said within themselves: "This is the heir; come, let us kill him." On this <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> remarks: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> proves most manifestly by these words that the rulers of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> crucified the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, not from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, but out of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>: for they understood that it was He to whom the Father says by the Prophet: 'Ask of Me, and I will give Thee the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> for Thy inheritance.'" It seems, therefore, that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him to be <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> or the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> says (<a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse24">John 15:24</a>): "But now they have both seen and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> both Me and My Father." Now what is seen is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> manifestly. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, inflicted the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> on Him out of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is said in a sermon delivered in the Council of Ephesus (P. iii, cap. x): "Just as he who tears up the imperial message is doomed to die, as despising the prince's word; so the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jew</a>, who crucified Him whom he had seen, will pay the penalty for daring to lay his hands on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Word Himself." Now this would not be so had they not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Him to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, because their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> would have excused them. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> in crucifying Christ <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse8">1 Corinthians 2:8</a>): "If they had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> it, they would never have crucified the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>." And (<a href="../bible/act003.htm#verse17">Acts 3:17</a>), Peter, addressing the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, says: "I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you did it through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, as did also your rulers." Likewise the Lord hanging upon the cross said: "Father, forgive them, for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what they do" (<a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse34">Luke 23:34</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Among the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> some were elders, and others of lesser degree. Now according to the author of De Qq. Nov. et Vet. Test., qu. lxvi, the elders, who were called "rulers, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>," as did also the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">devils</a>, "that He was the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> promised in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>: for they saw all the signs in Him which the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> said would come to pass: but they did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His Godhead." Consequently the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says: "If they had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> it, they would never have crucified the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>." It must, however, be understood that their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> did not excuse them from crime, because it was, as it were, affected <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. For they saw manifest signs of His Godhead; yet they perverted them out of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> of Christ; neither would they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> His words, whereby He avowed that He was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Hence He Himself says of them (<a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse22">John 15:22</a>): "If I had not come, and spoken to them, they would not have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but now they have no excuse for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." And afterwards He adds (<a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse24">John 15:24</a>): "If I had not done among them the works that no other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hath done, they would not have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." And so the expression employed by <a href="../cathen/08413a.htm">Job</a> (<a href="../bible/job021.htm#verse14">21:14</a>) can be accepted on their behalf: "(Who) said to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: depart from us, we desire not the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Thy ways."

<p>But those of lesser degree--namely, the common folk--who had not grasped the mysteries of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, did not fully comprehend that He was the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> or the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. For although some of them <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Him, yet the multitude did not; and if they <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> sometimes whether He was the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, on account of the manifold signs and force of His teaching, as is stated <a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse31">John 7:31-41</a>, nevertheless they were deceived afterwards by their rulers, so that they did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> or the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Hence Peter said to them: "I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you did it through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, as did also your rulers"--namely, because they were <a href="../cathen/13679c.htm">seduced</a> by the rulers.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Those words are spoken by the husbandmen of the vineyard; and these signify the rulers of the people, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him to be the heir, inasmuch as they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him to be the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> promised in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, but the words of <a href="../bible/psa002.htm#verse8">Psalm 2:8</a> seem to militate against this answer: "Ask of Me, and I will give Thee the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> for Thy inheritance"; which are addressed to Him of whom it is said: "Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten Thee." If, then, they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him to be the one to whom the words were addressed: "Ask of Me, and I will give Thee the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> for Thy inheritance," it follows that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>, too, says upon the same passage that "they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>." <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> likewise, commenting on the words, "For they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what they do" (<a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse34">Luke 23:34</a>), says: "It is to be observed that He does not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for them who, understanding Him to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, preferred to crucify Him rather than acknowledge Him." But to this it may be replied that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, not from His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, but from the excellence of His singular <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p>Yet we may hold that they are said to have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> also that He was verily the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, in that they had evident signs thereof: yet out of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, they refused credence to these signs, by which they might have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that He was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The words quoted are preceded by the following: "If I had not done among them the works that no other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hath done, they would not have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>"; and then follow the words: "But now they have both seen and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> both Me and My Father." Now all this shows that while they beheld <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> marvelous works, it was owing to their <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> that they did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Affected <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> does not excuse from guilt, but seems, rather, to aggravate it: for it shows that a man is so strongly attached to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that he wishes to incur <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> lest he avoid <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, as crucifiers not only of the Man-Christ, but also as of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the sin of those who crucified Christ was most grievous?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> crucifiers was not the most grievous. Because the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which has some excuse cannot be most grievous. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> Himself excused the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of His crucifiers when He said: "Father, forgive them: for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what they do" (<a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse34">Luke 23:34</a>). Therefore theirs was not the most grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> (<a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse11">John 19:11</a>): "He that hath delivered Me to thee hath the greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." But it was <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> who <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be crucified by his minions. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> the traitor seems to be greater than that of those who crucified Him.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. v): "No one suffers <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> willingly"; and in the same place he adds: "Where no one suffers <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, nobody works <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>." Consequently nobody wreaks <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> upon a willing subject. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> suffered willingly, as was shown above (1,2). Therefore those who crucified <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did Him no <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>; and hence their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was not the most grievous.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>, commenting on the words, "Fill ye up, then, the measure of your fathers" (<a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse32">Matthew 23:32</a>), says: "In very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> they exceeded the measure of their fathers; for these latter slew men, but they crucified <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>), the rulers of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that He was the Christ: and if there was any <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> in them, it was affected <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, which could not excuse them. Therefore their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was the most grievous, both on account of the kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as well as from the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of their will. The <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> also of the common order <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> most grievously as to the kind of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: yet in one respect their crime was lessened by reason of their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>, <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse34">Luke 23:34</a>, "Father, forgive them, for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what they do," says: "He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for them who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what they are doing, as having the zeal of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but not according to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, by whose hands He was crucified, was much more excusable, since they had no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above, the excuse made by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> is not to be referred to the rulers among the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, but to the common people.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> did not deliver up <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, but to the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who gave Him up to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse35">John 18:35</a>: "Thy own nation and the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> have delivered Thee up to me." But the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of all these was greater than that of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, who slew Christ from fear of Caesar; and even greater than the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the soldiers who crucified Him at the governor's bidding, not out of cupidity like <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a>, nor from <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> like the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, indeed willed His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> just as the Father willed it; yet He did not will the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> action of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>. Consequently Christ's slayers are not excused of their <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>. Nevertheless, whoever slays a man not only does a wrong to the one slain, but likewise to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to the State; just as he who kills himself, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. v). Hence it was that David condemned to death the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who "did not fear to lay hands upon the Lord's anointed," even though he (Saul) had requested it, as related in <a href="../bible/2sa001.htm#verse5">2 Samuel 1:5-14</a>.
