<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether evil is a nature?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For every genus is a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is a genus; for the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Praedic. x) that "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> are not in a genus, but are genera of other things." Therefore <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every difference which constitutes a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is a difference constituting a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morality</a>; for a bad <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> differs in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, as liberality from illiberality. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> signifies a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, each extreme of two contraries is a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> are not opposed as privation and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, but as contraries, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> shows (Praedic. x) by the fact that between <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> there is a medium, and from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> there can be a return to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> signifies a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, what is not, acts not. But <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> acts, for it corrupts <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is a being and a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, nothing belongs to the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> except what is a being and a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> belongs to the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> of things; for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchir. 10,11) that the "admirable beauty of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is made up of all things. In which even what is called <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, well ordered and in its place, is the eminent commendation of what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv), "<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">Evil</a> is neither a being nor a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> One opposite is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through the other, as darkness is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through light. Hence also what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is must be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now, we have said above that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is everything appetible; and thus, since every <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> desires its own being and its own perfection, it must be said also that the being and the perfection of any <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Hence it cannot be that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> signifies being, or any form or <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore it must be that by the name of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is signified the absence of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. And this is what is meant by saying that "<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is neither a being nor a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." For since being, as such, is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, the absence of one implies the absence of the other.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> speaks there according to the opinion of <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagoreans</a>, who thought that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> was a kind of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and therefore they asserted the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of the genus of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, especially in his <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> works, brings forward examples that in his time were probable in the opinion of some <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>. Or, it may be said that, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. iv, text 6), "the first kind of contrariety is <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> and privation," as being verified in all contraries; since one contrary is always imperfect in relation to another, as black in relation to white, and bitter in relation to sweet. And in this way <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> are said to be genera not simply, but in regard to contraries; because, as every form has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, so every privation, as such, has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> are not constitutive differences except in morals, which receive their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the end, which is the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, the source of all <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morality</a>. And because <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an end, therefore <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> are specific differences in moral things; <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in itself, but <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as the absence of the due end. Yet neither does the absence of the due end by itself constitute a moral <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, except as it is joined to the undue end; just as we do not find the privation of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things, unless it is joined to another form. Thus, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which is a constitutive difference in morals is a certain <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> joined to the privation of another <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; as the end proposed by the intemperate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not the privation of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, but the delight of sense without the order of reason. Hence <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not a constitutive difference as such, but by reason of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that is annexed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This appears from the above. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> speaks there of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morality</a>. Because in that respect, between <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> there is a medium, as <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is considered as something rightly ordered, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as a thing not only out of right order, but also as injurious to another. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, i) that a "prodigal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is foolish, but not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." And from this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morality</a>, there may be a return to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but not from any sort of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, for from blindness there is no return to sight, although blindness is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> A thing is said to act in a threefold sense. In one way, formally, as when we say that whiteness makes white; and in that sense <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> considered even as a privation is said to corrupt <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, forasmuch as it is itself a corruption or privation of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. In another sense a thing is said to act effectively, as when a painter makes a wall white.

<p>Thirdly, it is said in the sense of the final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as the end is said to effect by moving the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But in these two ways <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> does not effect anything of itself, that is, as a privation, but by virtue of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> annexed to it. For every action comes from some form; and everything which is desired as an end, is a perfection. And therefore, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv): "<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">Evil</a> does not act, nor is it desired, except by virtue of some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> joined to it: while of itself it is nothing definite, and beside the scope of our will and <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> As was said above, the parts of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> are ordered to each other, according as one acts on the other, and according as one is the end and exemplar of the other. But, as was said above, this can only happen to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as joined to some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> neither belongs to the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, nor does it come under the order of the same, except <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, that is, by reason of some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> joined to it.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether evil is found in things?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not found in things. For whatever is found in things, is either something, or a privation of something, that is a "not-being." But <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that "<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is distant from <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and even more distant from non-existence." Therefore <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not at all found in things.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "being" and "thing" are convertible. If therefore <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is a being in things, it follows that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is a thing, which is contrary to what has been said (1).

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "the white unmixed with black is the most white," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Topic. iii, 4). Therefore also the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> unmixed with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is the greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> makes always what is best, much more than <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> does. Therefore in things made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> On the above assumptions, all prohibitions and penalties would cease, for they <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> only for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was said above (47, 1,2), the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> requires that there should be inequality in things, so that every grade of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> may be realized. Now, one grade of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is that of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which cannot fail. Another grade of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is that of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which can fail in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, and this grade is to be found in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> itself; for some things there are which cannot lose their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> as incorruptible things, while some there are which can lose it, as things corruptible.

<p>As, therefore, the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> requires that there should be not only beings incorruptible, but also corruptible beings; so the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> requires that there should be some which can fail in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, and thence it follows that sometimes they do fail. Now it is in this that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> consists, namely, in the fact that a thing fails in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Hence it is clear that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is found in things, as corruption also is found; for corruption is itself an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">Evil</a> is distant both from simple being and from simple "not-being," because it is neither a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> nor a pure negation, but a privation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. v, text 14), being is twofold. In one way it is considered as signifying the entity of a thing, as divisible by the ten "predicaments"; and in that sense it is convertible with thing, and thus no privation is a being, and neither therefore is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> a being. In another sense being conveys the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of a proposition which unites together subject and attribute by a copula, notified by this word "is"; and in this sense being is what answers to the question, "Does it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>?" and thus we speak of blindness as being in the eye; or of any other privation. In this way even <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> can be called a being. Through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of this distinction some, considering that things may be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, or that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is said to be in things, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> was a positive thing in itself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and any other agent make what is best in the whole, but not what is best in every single part, except in order to the whole, as was said above (Question 47, Article 2). And the whole itself, which is the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> of creatures, is all the better and more perfect if some things in it can fail in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, and do sometimes fail, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> not preventing this. This happens, firstly, because "it belongs to Providence not to destroy, but to save <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>," as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv); but it belongs to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that what may fail should sometimes fail; secondly, because, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchir. 11), "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is so powerful that He can even make <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> out of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." Hence many <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things would be taken away if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> permitted no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>; for fire would not be generated if air was not corrupted, nor would the life of a lion be preserved unless the ass were killed. Neither would avenging <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> nor the patience of a sufferer be praised if there were no <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether evil is in good as in its subject?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as its subject. For <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is something that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>. But <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv, 4) that "<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, nor is it in that which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>." Therefore, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as its subject.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not a being; whereas <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is a being. But "non-being" does not require being as its subject. Therefore, neither does <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> require <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as its subject.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, one contrary is not the subject of another. But <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> are contraries. Therefore, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as in its subject.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the subject of whiteness is called white. Therefore also the subject of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. If, therefore, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as in its subject, it follows that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, against what is said (<a href="../bible/isa005.htm#verse20">Isaiah 5:20</a>): "Woe to you who call <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>!"

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion 14) that "<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> only in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was said above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> imports the absence of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But not every absence of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For absence of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> can be taken in a privative and in a negative sense. Absence of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, taken negatively, is not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; otherwise, it would follow that what does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and also that everything would be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, through not having the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> belonging to something else; for instance, a man would be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> who had not the swiftness of the roe, or the strength of a lion. But the absence of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, taken in a privative sense, is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; as, for instance, the privation of sight is called blindness.

<p>Now, the subject of privation and of form is one and the same--viz. being in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, whether it be being in absolute <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, as primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, which is the subject of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form, and of privation of the opposite form; or whether it be being in relative <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, and absolute <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a>, as in the case of a transparent body, which is the subject both of darkness and light. It is, however, manifest that the form which makes a thing actual is a perfection and a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and thus every actual being is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and likewise every <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a> being, as such, is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as having a relation to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. For as it has being in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, so has it <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. Therefore, the subject of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> means that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> things as a part, or as a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> property of any <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> thing.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> "Not-being," understood negatively, does not require a subject; but privation is negation in a subject, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. iv, text 4), and such "not-being" is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">Evil</a> is not in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> opposed to it as in its subject, but in some other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, for the subject of blindness is not "sight," but "animal." Yet, it appears, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion 13), that the rule of dialectics here fails, where it is laid down that contraries cannot <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> together. But this is to be taken as referring to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in general, but not in reference to any particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For white and black, sweet and bitter, and the like contraries, are only considered as contraries in a special sense, because they <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in some determinate genus; whereas <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> enters into every genus. Hence one <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> can coexist with the privation of another <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> invokes woe to those who say that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as such is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But this does not follow from what is said above, as is clear from the explanation given.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether evil corrupts the whole good?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> corrupts the whole <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. For one contrary is wholly corrupted by another. But <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> are contraries. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> corrupts the whole <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion 12) that "<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> hurts inasmuch as it takes away <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." But <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is all of a piece and uniform. Therefore it is wholly taken away by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as long as it lasts, hurts, and takes away <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But that from which something is always being removed, is at some time consumed, unless it is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, which cannot be said of any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> wholly consumes <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion 12) that "<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> cannot wholly consume <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">Evil</a> cannot wholly consume <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. To <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> this we must consider that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is threefold. One kind of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is wholly destroyed by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and this is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> opposed to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as light is wholly destroyed by darkness, and sight by blindness. Another kind of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is neither wholly destroyed nor diminished by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and that is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is the subject of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; for by darkness the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the air is not injured. And there is also a kind of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is diminished by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but is not wholly taken away; and this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is the aptitude of a subject to some <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">actuality</a>.

<p>The diminution, however, of this kind of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is not to be considered by way of subtraction, as diminution in <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, but rather by way of remission, as diminution in <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">forms</a>. The remission likewise of this habitude is to be taken as contrary to its intensity. For this kind of aptitude receives its intensity by the dispositions whereby the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is prepared for <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">actuality</a>; which the more they are multiplied in the subject the more is it fitted to receive its perfection and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>; and, on the contrary, it receives its remission by contrary dispositions which, the more they are multiplied in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and the more they are intensified, the more is the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> remitted as regards the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">actuality</a>.

<p>Therefore, if contrary dispositions cannot be multiplied and intensified to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>, but only to a certain limit, neither is the aforesaid aptitude diminished or remitted <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a>, as appears in the active and passive <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> of the elements; for coldness and humidity, whereby the aptitude of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> of fire is diminished or remitted, cannot be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> multiplied. But if the contrary dispositions can be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> multiplied, the aforesaid aptitude is also <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> diminished or remitted; yet, nevertheless, it is not wholly taken away, because its root always remains, which is the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the subject. Thus, if opaque bodies were interposed to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> between the sun and the air, the aptitude of the air to light would be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> diminished, but still it would never be wholly removed while the air remained, which in its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is transparent. Likewise, addition in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be made to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitude</a>, whereby the aptitude of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is more and more lessened; and these <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, indeed, are like obstacles interposed between us and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/isa059.htm#verse2">Isaiah 59:2</a>: "Our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> have divided between us and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Yet the aforesaid aptitude of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not wholly taken away, for it belongs to its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is opposed to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is wholly taken away; but other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goods</a> are not wholly removed, as said above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The aforesaid aptitude is a medium between subject and act. Hence, where it touches act, it is diminished by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; but where it touches the subject, it remains as it was. Therefore, although <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is like to itself, yet, on account of its relation to different things, it is not wholly, but only partially taken away.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Some, imagining that the diminution of this kind of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is like the diminution of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, said that just as the continuous is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> divisible, if the division be made in an ever same proportion (for instance, half of half, or a third of a third), so is it in the present case. But this explanation does not avail here. For when in a division we keep the same proportion, we continue to subtract less and less; for half of half is less than half of the whole. But a second <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> diminish the above mentioned aptitude less than a preceding <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but perchance either equally or more.

<p>Therefore it must be said that, although this aptitude is a finite thing, still it may be so diminished <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a>, not "per se," but <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>; according as the contrary dispositions are also increased <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a>, as explained above.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether evil is adequately divided into pain and fault?</h2> <span class="stiki">Pain here means "penalty": such was its original signification, being derived from "poena." In this sense we say "Pain of death, Pain of loss, Pain of sense."--Ed.</span>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not adequately divided into pain and fault. For every defect is a kind of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But in all creatures there is the defect of not being able to preserve their own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, which nevertheless is neither a pain nor a fault. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is inadequately divided into pain and fault.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in irrational creatures there is neither fault nor pain; but, nevertheless, they have corruption and defect, which are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. Therefore not every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is a pain or a fault.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but it is not a fault; for "<a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> which involves no consent, is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but an occasion for the exercise of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>," as is said in a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/2co012.htm">2 Corinthians 12</a>; not is it a pain; because <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> precedes the fault, and the pain follows afterwards. Therefore, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not sufficiently divided into pain and fault.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It would seem that this division is superfluous: for, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion 12), a thing is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> "because it hurts." But whatever hurts is penal. Therefore every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> comes under pain.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">Evil</a>, as was said above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>) is the privation of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which chiefly and of itself consists in perfection and act. Act, however, is twofold; first, and second. The first act is the form and integrity of a thing; the second act is its operation. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> also is twofold. In one way it occurs by the subtraction of the form, or of any part required for the integrity of the thing, as blindness is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as also it is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to be wanting in any member of the body. In another way <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> by the withdrawal of the due operation, either because it does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, or because it has not its due mode and order. But because <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in itself is the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, which is the privation of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, is found in a special way in rational creatures which have a will. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which comes from the withdrawal of the form and integrity of the thing, has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a pain; and especially so on the supposition that all things are subject to <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as was shown above (Question 22, Article 2); for it is of the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a pain to be against the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which consists in the subtraction of the due operation in <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> things has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a fault; for this is imputed to anyone as a fault to fail as regards perfect action, of which he is master by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> things is to be looked upon as a pain or a fault.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Because <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is the privation of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and not a mere negation, as was said above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), therefore not every defect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but the defect of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> due. For the want of sight is not an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in a stone, but it is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in an animal; since it is against the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a stone to see. So, likewise, it is against the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a creature to be preserved in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> by itself, because <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> and conservation come from one and the same source. Hence this kind of defect is not an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as regards a creature.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Pain and fault do not divide <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> absolutely considered, but <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that is found in <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Temptation, as importing provocation to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, is always an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of fault in the tempter; but in the one tempted it is not, properly speaking, a fault; unless through the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> some change is wrought in the one who is tempted; for thus is the action of the agent in the patient. And if the tempted is changed to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by the tempter he falls into fault.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> In answer to the opposite argument, it must be said that the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of pain includes the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of injury to the agent in himself, whereas the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of fault includes the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of injury to the agent in his operation; and thus both are contained in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as including the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of injury.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether pain has the nature of evil more than fault has?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that pain has more of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> than fault. For fault is to pain what <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> is to reward. But reward has more <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> than <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, as its end. Therefore pain has more <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in it than fault has.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that is the greater <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which is opposed to the greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But pain, as was said above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>), is opposed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the agent, while fault is opposed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the action. Therefore, since the agent is better than the action, it seems that pain is worse than fault.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the privation of the end is a pain consisting in forfeiting the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a>; whereas the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of fault is privation of the order to the end. Therefore pain is a greater <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> than fault.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A wise workman chooses a less <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in order to prevent a greater, as the surgeon cuts off a limb to save the whole body. But divine wisdom inflicts pain to prevent fault. Therefore fault is a greater <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> than pain.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Fault has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> more than pain has; not only more than pain of sense, consisting in the privation of corporeal goods, which kind of pain appeals to most men; but also more than any kind of pain, thus taking pain in its most general meaning, so as to include privation of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> or <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p>There is a twofold reason for this. The first is that one becomes <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of fault, but not by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of pain, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv): "To be punished is not an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; but it is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to be made worthy of punishment." And this because, since <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> absolutely considered consists in act, and not in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, and the ultimate act is operation, or the use of something possessed, it follows that the absolute <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> consists in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> operation, or the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> use of something possessed. Now we use all things by the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Hence from a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will, which makes a man use well what he has, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is called <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and from a bad will he is called bad. For a man who has a bad will can use ill even the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> he has, as when a grammarian of his own will speaks incorrectly. Therefore, because the fault itself consists in the disordered act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and the pain consists in the privation of something used by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, fault has more of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in it than pain has.

<p>The second reason can be taken from the fact that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the author of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of pain, but not of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of fault. And this is because the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of pain takes away the creature's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which may be either something <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>, as sight, destroyed by blindness, or something uncreated, as by being deprived of the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a>, the creature forfeits its uncreated <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of fault is properly opposed to uncreated <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; for it is opposed to the fulfilment of the divine will, and to divine love, whereby the divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is loved for itself, and not only as shared by the creature. Therefore it is plain that fault has more <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in it than pain has.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although fault results in pain, as <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> in reward, yet fault is not intended on account of the pain, as <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> is for the reward; but rather, on the contrary, pain is brought about so that the fault may be avoided, and thus fault is worse than pain.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The order of action which is destroyed by fault is the more perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the agent, since it is the second perfection, than the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> taken away by pain, which is the first perfection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Pain and fault are not to be compared as end and order to the end; because one may be deprived of both of these in some way, both by fault and by pain; by pain, accordingly as a man is removed from the end and from the order to the end; by fault, inasmuch as this privation belongs to the action which is not ordered to its due end.
