<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether anger causes pleasure?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> pleasure. Because sorrow excludes pleasure. But <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is never without sorrow, since, as stated in Ethic. vii, 6, "everyone that acts from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, acts with pain." Therefore <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> pleasure.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 5) that "vengeance makes <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> to cease, because it substitutes pleasure for pain": whence we may gather that the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> derives pleasure from vengeance, and that vengeance quells his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. Therefore on the advent of pleasure, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> departs: and consequently <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is not an effect united with pleasure.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no effect hinders its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, since it is conformed to its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But pleasure hinders <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> as stated in Rhet. ii, 3. Therefore pleasure is not an effect of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iv, 5) quotes the saying that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is "Sweet to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as honey to the taste" (Iliad, xviii, 109 [trl. Pope]).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 14), pleasures, chiefly sensible and bodily pleasures, are remedies against sorrow: and therefore the greater the sorrow or anxiety, the more sensible are we to the pleasure which heals it, as is evident in the case of thirst which increases the pleasure of drink. Now it is clear from what has been said (47, A1,3), that the movement of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> arises from a wrong done that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> sorrow, for which sorrow vengeance is sought as a remedy. Consequently as soon as vengeance is present, pleasure ensues, and so much the greater according as the sorrow was greater. Therefore if vengeance be really present, perfect pleasure ensues, entirely excluding sorrow, so that the movement of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> ceases. But before vengeance is really present, it becomes present to the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in two ways: in one way, by hope; because none is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> except he hopes for vengeance, as stated above (Question 46, Article 1); in another way, by thinking of it continually, for to everyone that desires a thing it is pleasant to dwell on the thought of what he desires; wherefore the imaginings of dreams are pleasant. Accordingly an <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> takes pleasure in thinking much about vengeance. This pleasure, however, is not perfect, so as to banish sorrow and consequently <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not grieve and rejoice at the same thing; he grieves for the wrong done, while he takes pleasure in the thought and hope of vengeance. Consequently sorrow is to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> as its beginning; while pleasure is the effect or terminus of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument holds in regard to pleasure <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the real presence of vengeance, which banishes <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> altogether.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Pleasure that precedes hinders sorrow from ensuing, and consequently is a hindrance to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. But pleasure felt in taking vengeance follows from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether anger above all causes fervor in the heart?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that heat is not above all the effect of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. For fervor, as stated above (28, 5; 37, 2), belongs to love. But love, as above stated, is the beginning and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Since then the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is more powerful than its effect, it seems that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is not the chief <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of fervor.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, those things which, of themselves, arouse fervor, increase as time goes on; thus love grows stronger the longer it lasts. But in course of time <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> grows weaker; for the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 3) that "time puts an end to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>." Therefore fervor is not the proper effect of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, fervor added to fervor produces greater fervor. But "the addition of a greater <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> banishes already <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 3). Therefore <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> fervor.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 16) that "<a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is fervor of the blood around the heart, resulting from an exhalation of the bile."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 44, Article 1), the bodily transmutation that occurs in the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is proportionate to the movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Now it is evident that every <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, even the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, tends with greater force to repel that which is contrary to it, if it be present: hence we see that hot water freezes harder, as though the cold acted with greater force on the hot object. Since then the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> movement of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by some injury inflicted, as by a contrary that is present; it follows that the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> tends with great force to repel the injury by the desire of vengeance; and hence ensues great vehemence and impetuosity in the movement of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. And because the movement of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is not one of recoil, which corresponds to the action of cold, but one of prosecution, which corresponds to the action of heat, the result is that the movement of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> produces fervor of the blood and vital spirits around the heart, which is the instrument of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. And hence it is that, on account of the heart being so disturbed by <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, those chiefly who are <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> betray signs thereof in their outer members. For, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. v, 30) "the heart that is inflamed with the stings of its own <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> beats quick, the body trembles, the tongue stammers, the countenance takes fire, the eyes grow fierce, they that are well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> are not recognized. With the mouth indeed he shapes a sound, but the understanding <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not what it says."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> "Love itself is not felt so keenly as in the absence of the beloved," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> observes (De Trin. x, 12). Consequently when a man suffers from a hurt done to the excellence that he loves, he feels his love thereof the more: the result being that his heart is moved with greater heat to remove the hindrance to the object of his love; so that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> increases the fervor of love and makes it to be felt more.

<p>Nevertheless, the fervor arising from heat differs according as it is to be referred to love or to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. Because the fervor of love has a certain sweetness and gentleness; for it tends to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that one loves: whence it is likened to the warmth of the air and of the blood. For this reason sanguine temperaments are more inclined to love; and hence the saying that "love springs from the liver," because of the blood being formed there. On the other hand, the fervor of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> has a certain bitterness with a tendency to destroy, for it seeks to be avenged on the contrary <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: whence it is likened to the heat of fire and of the bile, and for this reason <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 16) that it "results from an exhalation of the bile whence it takes its name <em>chole</em>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">Time</a>, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, weakens all those things, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of which are impaired by <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Now it is evident that <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> is weakened by time; for things which happened long ago easily slip from our <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>. But <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> of a wrong done. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is impaired little by little as time goes on, until at length it vanishes altogether. Moreover a wrong seems greater when it is first felt; and our estimate thereof is gradually lessened the further the sense of present wrong recedes into the past. The same applies to love, so long as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of love is in the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> alone; wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. viii, 5) that "if a friend's absence lasts long, it seems to make men forget their friendship." But in the presence of a friend, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of friendship is continually being multiplied by time: wherefore the friendship increases: and the same would apply to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, were its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> continually multiplied.

<p>Nevertheless the very fact that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> soon spends itself proves the strength of its fervor: for as a great fire is soon spent having burnt up all the fuel; so too <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, by reason of its vehemence, soon dies away.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Every power that is divided in itself is weakened. Consequently if a man being already <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with one, becomes <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with another, by this very fact his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> with the former is weakened. Especially is this so if his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> in the second case be greater: because the wrong done which aroused his former <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, will, in comparison with the second wrong, which is reckoned greater, seem to be of little or no account.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether anger above all hinders the use of reason?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> does not hinder the use of reason. Because that which presupposes an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, does not seem to hinder the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. But "<a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> listens to reason," as stated in Ethic. vii, 6. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> does not hinder reason.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the more the reason is hindered, the less does a man show his thoughts. But the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 6) that "an <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not cunning but is open." Therefore <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> does not seem to hinder the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, as desire does; for desire is cunning, as he also states (Ethic. vii, 6.).

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the judgment of reason becomes more evident by juxtaposition of the contrary: because contraries stand out more clearly when placed beside one another. But this also increases <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 2) that "men are more <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> if they receive unwonted treatment; for instance, honorable men, if they be dishonored": and so forth. Therefore the same <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> increases <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and facilitates the judgment of reason. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> does not hinder the judgment of reason.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. v, 30) that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> "withdraws the light of understanding, while by agitating it troubles the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> or reason makes no use of a bodily organ in its proper act, yet, since it needs certain sensitive powers for the execution of its act, the acts of which powers are hindered when the body is disturbed, it follows of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> that any disturbance in the body hinders even the judgment of reason; as is clear in the case of drunkenness or sleep. Now it has been stated (2) that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, above all, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a bodily disturbance in the region of the heart, so much as to effect even the outward members. Consequently, of all the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is the most manifest obstacle to the judgment of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa030.htm#verse10">Psalm 30:10</a>: "My eye is troubled with wrath."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The beginning of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is in the reason, as regards the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> movement, which is the formal element of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. But the passion of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> forestalls the perfect judgment of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, as though it listened but imperfectly to reason, on account of the commotion of the heat urging to instant action, which commotion is the material element of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. In this respect it hinders the judgment of reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> An <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is said to be open, not because it is clear to him what he ought to do, but because he acts openly, without thought of hiding himself. This is due partly to the reason being hindered, so as not to discern what should be hidden and what done openly, nor to devise the means of hiding; and partly to the dilatation of the heart which pertains to magnanimity which is an effect of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says of the magnanimous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> (Ethic. iv, 3) that "he is open in his hatreds and his friendships . . . and speaks and acts openly." Desire, on the other hand, is said to lie low and to be cunning, because, in many cases, the pleasurable things that are desired, savor of shame and voluptuousness, wherein <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> wishes not to be seen. But in those things that savor of manliness and excellence, such as matters of vengeance, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> seeks to be in the open.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (ad 1), the movement of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> begins in the reason, wherefore the juxtaposition of one contrary with another facilitates the judgment of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, on the same grounds as it increases <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. For when a man who is possessed of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> or <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, suffers a loss therein, the loss seems all the greater, both on account of the contrast, and because it was unforeseen. Consequently it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> greater grief: just as a great <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, through being received unexpectedly, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> greater delight. And in proportion to the increase of the grief that precedes, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is increased also.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether anger above all causes taciturnity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> taciturnity. Because taciturnity is opposed to speech. But increase in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> conduces to speech; as is evident from the degrees of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> laid down by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse22">Matthew 5:22</a>): where He says: "Whosoever is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with his brother"; and " . . . whosoever shall say to his brother, 'Raca'"; and " . . . whosoever shall say to his brother, 'Thou fool.'" Therefore <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> taciturnity.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, through failing to obey reason, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> sometimes breaks out into unbecoming words: hence it is written (<a href="../bible/pro025.htm#verse28">Proverbs 25:28</a>): "As a city that lieth open and is not compassed with walls, so is a man that cannot refrain his own spirit in speaking." But <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, above all, hinders the judgment of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). Consequently above all it makes one break out into unbecoming words. Therefore it does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> taciturnity.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse34">Matthew 12:34</a>): "Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh." But <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, above all, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a disturbance in the heart, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Therefore above all it conduces to speech. Therefore it does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> taciturnity.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. v, 30) that "when <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> does not vent itself outwardly by the lips, inwardly it burns the more fiercely."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (3; 46, 4), <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> both follows an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, and hinders the reason: and in both respects it may <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> taciturnity. On the part of the reason, when the judgment of reason prevails so far, that although it does not curb the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> in its inordinate desire for vengeance, yet it curbs the tongue from unbridled speech. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. v, 30): "Sometimes when the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is disturbed, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, as if in judgment, commands silence." On the part of the impediment to reason because, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), the disturbance of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> reaches to the outward members, and chiefly to those members which reflect more distinctly the emotions of the heart, such as the eyes, face and tongue; wherefore, as observed above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), "the tongue stammers, the countenance takes fire, the eyes grow fierce." Consequently <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> may <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> such a disturbance, that the tongue is altogether deprived of speech; and taciturnity is the result.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Anger sometimes goes so far as to hinder the reason from curbing the tongue: but sometimes it goes yet farther, so as to paralyze the tongue and other outward members.

<p>And this suffices for the Reply to the Second Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The disturbance of the heart may sometimes superabound to the extend that the movements of the outward members are hindered by the inordinate movement of the heart. Thence ensue taciturnity and immobility of the outward members; and sometimes even death. If, however, the disturbance be not so great, then "out of the abundance of the heart" thus disturbed, the mouth proceeds to speak.
