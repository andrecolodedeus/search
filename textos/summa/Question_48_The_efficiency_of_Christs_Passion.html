<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether Christ's Passion brought about our salvation by way of merit?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> did not bring about our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by way of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. For the sources of our sufferings are not within us. But no one <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> or is praised except for that whose principle lies within him. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> wrought nothing by way of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, from the beginning of His conception <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> for Himself and for us, as stated above (9, 4; 34, 3). But it is superfluous to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> over again what has been <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> before. Therefore by His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> Christ did not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the source of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> was not made greater by the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> than it was before. Therefore He did not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by suffering more than He had already.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> on the words of <a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse9">Philippians 2:9</a>, "Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> exalted Him," etc., <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. civ in Joan.): "The lowliness" of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> "<a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> was the reward of lowliness." But He was glorified, not merely in Himself, but likewise in His faithful ones, as He says Himself (<a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse10">John 17:10</a>). Therefore it appears that He <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the faithful.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (7, 1,9; 8, 1,5), <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was bestowed upon <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, not only as an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, but inasmuch as He is the Head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, so that it might overflow into His members; and therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> works are referred to Himself and to His members in the same way as the works of any other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in a state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a> are referred to himself. But it is evident that whosoever suffers for <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice's</a> sake, provided that he be in a state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a>, <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> his <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> thereby, according to <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse10">Matthew 5:10</a>: "Blessed are they that suffer <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> for <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice's</a> sake." Consequently <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, not only for Himself, but likewise for all His members.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Suffering, as such, is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by an outward principle: but inasmuch as one bears it willingly, it has an inward principle.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> From the beginning of His conception <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> our <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; but on our side there were some obstacles, whereby we were hindered from securing the effect of His preceding <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>: consequently, in order to remove such hindrances, "it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to suffer," as stated above (Question 46, Article 3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> has a special effect, which His preceding <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> did not possess, not on account of greater <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, but because of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the work, which was suitable for such an effect, as is clear from the arguments brought forward above all the fittingness of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> (46, Answers 3,4).

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether Christ's Passion brought about our salvation by way of atonement?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> did not bring about our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by way of atonement. For it seems that to make the atonement devolves on him who commits the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; as is clear in the other parts of penance, because he who has done the wrong must grieve over it and confess it. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> never <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse22">1 Peter 2:22</a>: "Who did no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." Therefore He made no atonement by His personal suffering.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no atonement is made to another by committing a graver offense. But in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> the gravest of all offenses was perpetrated, because those who slew Him <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> most grievously, as stated above (Question 47, Article 6). Consequently it seems that atonement could not be made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, atonement implies equality with the trespass, since it is an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> does not appear equal to all the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not suffer in His Godhead, but in His flesh, according to <a href="../bible/1pe004.htm#verse1">1 Peter 4:1</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> therefore having suffered in the flesh." Now the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is the subject of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is of greater account than the flesh. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not <a href="../cathen/02055a.htm">atone</a> for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa068.htm#verse5">Psalm 68:5</a>) in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>: "Then did I pay that which I took not away." But he has not paid who has not fully atoned. Therefore it appears that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by His suffering has fully atoned for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> He properly <a href="../cathen/02055a.htm">atones</a> for an offense who offers something which the offended one loves equally, or even more than he detested the offense. But by suffering out of love and obedience, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> gave more to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than was required to compensate for the offense of the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. First of all, because of the exceeding <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> from which He suffered; secondly, on account of the dignity of His life which He laid down in atonement, for it was the life of one who was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; thirdly, on account of the extent of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, and the greatness of the grief endured, as stated above (Question 46, Article 6). And therefore <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> was not only a sufficient but a superabundant atonement for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>; according to <a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse2">1 John 2:2</a>: "He is the propitiation for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: and not for ours only, but also for those of the whole world."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The head and members are as one mystic <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; and therefore Christ's satisfaction belongs to all the faithful as being His members. Also, in so far as any two men are one in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, the one can <a href="../cathen/02055a.htm">atone</a> for the other as shall be shown later (XP, 13, 2). But the same reason does not hold <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of confession and <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, because atonement consists in an outward action, for which helps may be used, among which friends are to be computed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> love was greater than His slayers' <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>: and therefore the value of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> in atoning surpassed the murderous guilt of those who crucified Him: so much so that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> suffering was sufficient and superabundant atonement for His murderer's crime.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The dignity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh is not to be estimated solely from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of flesh, but also from the Person assuming it--namely, inasmuch as it was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> flesh, the result of which was that it was of <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> worth.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether Christ's Passion operated by way of sacrifice?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> did not operate by way of sacrifice. For the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> should correspond with the figure. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh was never offered up in the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, which were figures of Christ: nay, such <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> were reputed as impious, according to <a href="../bible/psa105.htm#verse38">Psalm 105:38</a>: "And they shed innocent blood: the blood of their sons and of their daughters, which they sacrificed to the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> of Chanaan." It seems therefore that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> cannot be called a sacrifice.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei x) that "a visible sacrifice is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>--that is, a sacred sign--of an invisible sacrifice." Now <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> is not a sign, but rather the thing signified by other signs. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> is not a sacrifice.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whoever offers sacrifice performs some sacred rite, as the very word "sacrifice" shows. But those men who slew Christ did not perform any sacred act, but rather wrought a great wrong. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> was rather a malefice than a sacrifice.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse2">Ephesians 5:2</a>): "He delivered Himself up for us, an oblation and a sacrifice to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for an odor of sweetness."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A sacrifice properly so called is something done for that <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> which is properly due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in order to appease Him: and hence it is that <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei x): "A <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sacrifice is every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work done in order that we may cling to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fellowship, yet referred to that consummation of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> wherein we can be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> blessed." But, as is added in the same place, "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> offered Himself up for us in the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>": and this <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> enduring of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> was most acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as coming from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore it is manifest that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> was a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sacrifice. Moreover, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says farther on in the same book, "the primitive <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers were many and various signs of this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sacrifice, one being prefigured by many, in the same way as a single concept of thought is expressed in many words, in order to commend it without tediousness": and, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> observe, (De Trin. iv), "since there are four things to be noted in every sacrifice--to wit, to whom it is offered, by whom it is offered, what is offered, and for whom it is offered--that the same one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Mediator reconciling us with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through the peace-sacrifice might continue to be one with Him to whom He offered it, might be one with them for whom He offered it, and might Himself be the offerer and what He offered."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> answers to the figure in some respects, yet it does not in all, since the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> must go beyond the figure. Therefore the figure of this sacrifice, in which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh is offered, was flesh right fittingly, not the flesh of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but of animals, as denoting Christ's. And this is a most perfect sacrifice. First of all, since being flesh of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it is fittingly offered for men, and is partaken of by them under the Sacrament. Secondly, because being passible and mortal, it was fit for immolation. Thirdly, because, being sinless, it had <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to cleanse from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Fourthly, because, being the offerer's own flesh, it was acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on account of His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> in offering up His own flesh. Hence it is that <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iv): "What else could be so fittingly partaken of by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, or offered up for men, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh? What else could be so appropriate for this immolation as mortal flesh? What else is there so clean for cleansing mortals as the flesh born in the womb without fleshly <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, and coming from a virginal womb? What could be so favorably offered and accepted as the flesh of our sacrifice, which was made the body of our Priest?"

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is speaking there of visible figurative <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>: and even <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, although denoted by other figurative <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, is yet a sign of something to be observed by us, according to <a href="../bible/1pe004.htm#verse1">1 Peter 4:1</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> therefore, having suffered in the flesh, be you also armed with the same thought: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: that now he may live the rest of his time in the flesh, not after the desires of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> was indeed a malefice on His slayers' part; but on His own it was the sacrifice of one suffering out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Hence it is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> who is said to have offered this sacrifice, and not the executioners.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether Christ's Passion brought about our salvation by way of redemption?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> did not effect our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by way of redemption. For no one purchases or redeems what never ceased to belong to him. But men never ceased to belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> according to <a href="../bible/psa023.htm#verse1">Psalm 23:1</a>: "The earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof: the world and all they that dwell therein." Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not redeem us by His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiii): "The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> had to be overthrown by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>." But <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> requires that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who has treacherously seized another's property shall be deprived of it, because deceit and cunning should not benefit anyone, as even <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laws declare. Consequently, since the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> by treachery deceived and subjugated to himself <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> creature, it seems that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ought not to be rescued from his power by way of redemption.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whoever buys or redeems an object pays the price to the holder. But it was not to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, who held us in bondage, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> paid His blood as the price of our redemption. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not redeem us by His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/1pe001.htm#verse18">1 Peter 1:18</a>): "You were not redeemed with corruptible things as gold or silver from your vain conversation of the tradition of your fathers: but with the precious blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as of a lamb unspotted and undefiled." And (<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse13">Galatians 3:13</a>): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> hath redeemed us from the curse of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, being made a curse for us." Now He is said to be a curse for us inasmuch as He suffered upon the tree, as stated above (Question 46, Article 4). Therefore He did redeem us by His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Man was held captive on account of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in two ways: first of all, by the bondage of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because (<a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse34">John 8:34</a>): "Whosoever committeth <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the servant of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>"; and (<a href="../bible/2pe002.htm#verse19">2 Peter 2:19</a>): "By whom a man is overcome, of the same also he is the <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a>." Since, then, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> had overcome <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by inducing him to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was subject to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> bondage. Secondly, as to the debt of punishment, to the payment of which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was held fast by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: and this, too, is a kind of bondage, since it savors of bondage for a man to suffer what he does not wish, just as it is the free <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> to apply himself to what he wills.

<p>Since, then, <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> was a sufficient and a superabundant atonement for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and the debt of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, it was as a price at the cost of which we were freed from both <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a>. For the atonement by which one satisfies for self or another is called the price, by which he ransoms himself or someone else from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and its penalty, according to <a href="../bible/dan004.htm#verse24">Daniel 4:24</a>: "Redeem thou thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> with <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> made satisfaction, not by giving money or anything of the sort, but by bestowing what was of greatest price--Himself--for us. And therefore <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> is called our redemption.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> is said to belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in two ways. First of all, in so far as he comes under <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> power: in which way he never ceased to belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; according to <a href="../bible/dan004.htm#verse22">Daniel 4:22</a>: "The Most High ruleth over the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and giveth it to whomsoever he will." Secondly, by being united to Him in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse9">Romans 8:9</a>: "If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> have not the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he is none of His." In the first way, then, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> never ceased to belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but in the second way he did cease because of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And therefore in so far as he was delivered from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by the satisfaction of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, he is said to be redeemed by the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion of Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Man by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> became the bondsman both of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Through guilt he had offended <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and put himself under the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> by consenting to him; consequently he did not become <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> servant on account of his guilt, but rather, by withdrawing from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> service, he, by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> just permission, fell under the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> servitude on account of the offense perpetrated. But as to the penalty, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was chiefly bound to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as his sovereign judge, and to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> as his torturer, according to <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse25">Matthew 5:25</a>: "Lest perhaps the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer"--that is, "to the relentless avenging <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>," as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. xi). Consequently, although, after deceiving <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, so far as in him lay, held him <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> in bondage as to both <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and penalty, still it was just that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should suffer it. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> so permitting it as to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and ordaining it as to the penalty. And therefore <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> required <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> redemption with regard to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but not with regard to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Because, with regard to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, redemption was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> deliverance, but not with regard to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, the price had to be paid not to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, but to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is said to have paid the price of our redemption--His own precious blood--not to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, but to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether it is proper to Christ to be the Redeemer?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is not proper to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be the Redeemer, because it is written (<a href="../bible/psa030.htm#verse6">Psalm 30:6</a>): "Thou hast redeemed me, O Lord, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Truth." But to be the Lord <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Truth belongs to the entire <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>. Therefore it is not proper to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, he is said to redeem who pays the price of redemption. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father gave His Son in redemption for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as is written (<a href="../bible/psa110.htm#verse9">Psalm 110:9</a>): "The Lord hath sent redemption to His people," upon which the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> adds, "that is, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who gives redemption to captives." Therefore not only <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but the Father also, redeemed us.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, not only <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, but also that of other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> conduced to our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, according to <a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse24">Colossians 1:24</a>: "I now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up those things that are wanting of the sufferings of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in my flesh for His body, which is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>." Therefore the title of Redeemer belongs not only to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but also to the other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse13">Galatians 3:13</a>): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> redeemed us from the curse of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, being made a curse for us." But only <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was made a curse for us. Therefore only <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> ought to be called our Redeemer.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> For someone to redeem, two things are required--namely, the act of paying and the price paid. For if in redeeming something a man pays a price which is not his own, but another's, he is not said to be the chief redeemer, but rather the other is, whose price it is. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> blood or His bodily life, which "is in the blood," is the price of our redemption (<a href="../bible/lev017.htm#verse11">Leviticus 17:11-14</a>), and that life He paid. Hence both of these belong immediately to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; but to the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> as to the first and remote <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, to whom <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> life belonged as to its first author, and from whom <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> received the inspiration of suffering for us. Consequently it is proper to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be the Redeemer immediately; although the redemption may be ascribed to the whole <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> as its first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> explains the text thus: "Thou, O Lord <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Truth, hast redeemed me in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, crying out, 'Lord, into Thy hands I commend my spirit.'" And so redemption belongs immediately to the Man-Christ, but principally to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The Man-Christ paid the price of our redemption immediately, but at the command of the Father as the original author.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The sufferings of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are beneficial to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as by way, not of redemption, but of example and exhortation, according to <a href="../bible/2co001.htm#verse6">2 Corinthians 1:6</a>: "Whether we be in tribulation, it is for your exhortation and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>."

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether Christ's Passion brought about our salvation efficiently?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> did not bring about our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> efficiently. For the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is the greatness of the Divine power, according to <a href="../bible/isa059.htm#verse1">Isaiah 59:1</a>: "Behold the hand of the Lord is not shortened that it cannot save." But "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was crucified through weakness," as it is written (<a href="../bible/2co013.htm#verse4">2 Corinthians 13:4</a>). Therefore, <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> did not bring about our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> efficiently.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no corporeal agency acts efficiently except by contact: hence even Christ cleansed the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> by touching him "in order to show that His flesh had saving power," as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> [Theophylact, Enarr. in Luc.] says. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> could not touch all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. Therefore it could not efficiently bring about the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it does not seem to be consistent for the same agent to operate by way of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> and by way of efficiency, since he who <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> awaits the result from someone else. But it was by way of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> accomplished our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Therefore it was not by way of efficiency.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse18">1 Corinthians 1:18</a>) that "the word of the cross to them that are saved . . . is the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> power brings about our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> efficiently. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> on the cross accomplished our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> efficiently.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There is a twofold efficient agency--namely, the principal and the instrumental. Now the principal efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> humanity is the "instrument of the Godhead," as stated above (Question 43, Article 2), therefore all <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> actions and sufferings operate instrumentally in virtue of His Godhead for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Consequently, then, <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> accomplishes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> efficiently.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> in relation to His flesh is consistent with the infirmity which He took upon Himself, but in relation to the Godhead it draws <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> might from It, according to <a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse25">1 Corinthians 1:25</a>: "The weakness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is stronger than men"; because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> weakness, inasmuch as He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has a might exceeding all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, although corporeal, has yet a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> effect from the Godhead united: and therefore it secures its efficacy by <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> contact--namely, by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse25">Romans 3:25</a>): "Whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath proposed to be a propitiation, through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in His blood."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, according as it is compared with His Godhead, operates in an efficient manner: but in so far as it is compared with the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> it acts in a <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> manner: considered as being within <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> very flesh, it acts by way of satisfaction, inasmuch as we are liberated by it from the debt of punishment; while inasmuch as we are freed from the servitude of guilt, it acts by way of redemption: but in so far as we are reconciled with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> it acts by way of sacrifice, as shall be shown farther on (49).
