<h1>Question 48. The object of the consent</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5048.htm#article1"> Is the consent that makes a marriage a consent to carnal intercourse?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5048.htm#article2"> Does consent to marry a person for an immoral motive make a marriage?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the consent that makes a marriage is a consent to carnal intercourse?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the consent which makes a marriage is a consent to carnal intercourse. For <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> [The words quoted are found implicitly in <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> (De Bono Viduit ix)] says that "for those who have vowed <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> it is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, not only to marry, but even to wish to marry." But it would not be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> unless it were contrary to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, and marriage is not contrary to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> except by reason of carnal intercourse. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will's</a> consent in marriage is a consent to carnal intercourse.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever there is in marriage between husband and wife is lawful between brother and sister except carnal intercourse. But there cannot lawfully be a consent to marriage between them. Therefore the marriage consent is a consent to carnal intercourse.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> say to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: "I consent to take thee provided however that you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> me not," it is not a marriage consent, because it contains something against the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of that consent. Yet this would not be the case unless the marriage consent were a consent to carnal intercourse. Therefore, etc.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, in everything the beginning corresponds to the consummation. Now marriage is consummated by carnal intercourse. Therefore, since it begins by the consent, it would seem that the consent is to carnal intercourse.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> No one that consents to carnal intercourse is a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> in mind and body. Yet Blessed John the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> after consenting to marriage was a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> both in mind and body. Therefore he did not consent to carnal intercourse.

<p>Further, the effect corresponds to its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Now consent is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of marriage. Since then carnal intercourse is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to marriage, seemingly neither is the consent which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> marriage a consent to carnal intercourse.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The consent that makes a marriage is a consent to marriage, because the proper effect of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the thing willed. Wherefore, according as carnal intercourse stands in relation to marriage, so far is the consent that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> marriage a consent to carnal intercourse. Now, as stated above (44, 1; 45, 1,2), marriage is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> the carnal union itself, but a certain joining together of husband and wife ordained to carnal intercourse, and a further consequent union between husband and wife, in so far as they each receive power over the other in reference to carnal intercourse, which joining together is called the nuptial bond. Hence it is evident that they said well who asserted that to consent to marriage is to consent to carnal intercourse implicitly and not explicitly. For carnal intercourse is not to be understood, except as an effect is implicitly contained in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, for the power to have carnal intercourse, which power is the object of the consent, is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of carnal intercourse, just as the power to use one's own property is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the use.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The reason why consent to marriage after taking the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, is because that consent gives a power to do what is unlawful: even so would a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> if he gave another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> the power to receive that which he has in deposit, and not only by actually delivering it to him. With regard to the consent of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, we have spoken about it above (Sent. iv, D, 3; III, 29, 2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Between brother and sister there can be no power of one over the other in relation to carnal intercourse, even as neither can there be lawfully carnal intercourse itself. Consequently the argument does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Such an explicit <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> is contrary not only to the act but also to the power of carnal intercourse, and therefore it is contrary to marriage.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Marriage begun corresponds to marriage consummated, as <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> or power corresponds to the act which is operation.

<p>The arguments on the contrary side show that consent is not given explicitly to carnal intercourse; and this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether marriage can result from one person's consent to take another for a base motive?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that marriage cannot result from one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> consent to take another for a base motive. For there is but one reason for one thing. Now marriage is one sacrament. Therefore it cannot result from the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of any other end than that for which it was instituted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; namely the begetting of children.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the marriage union is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse6">Matthew 19:6</a>, "What . . . <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath joined together let no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> put asunder." But a union that is made for immoral motives is not from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore it is not a marriage.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, if the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> be not observed, the sacrament is invalid. Now the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> is not directed to a base purpose. Therefore, if a marriage be contracted for a base purpose, it will not be a valid marriage.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> (De Diff., Topic. ii) "a thing is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> if its end be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." But <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> is always <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> if it is done for an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> end.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> signifies the union of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and in this there can be nothing base. Neither therefore can marriage be contracted for a base motive.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> He who baptizes another for the sake of gain baptizes validly. Therefore if a man marries a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> for the purpose of gain it is a valid marriage.

<p>Further, the same conclusion is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the examples and authorities quoted in the text (Sent. iv, D, 30).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of marriage may be taken as twofold, namely <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> and <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of marriage is the end to which it is by its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> ordained, and this is always <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, namely the begetting of children and the avoiding of fornication. But the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> thereof is that which the contracting parties intend as the result of marriage. And since that which is intended as the result of marriage is consequent upon marriage, and since that which comes first is not altered by what comes after, but conversely; marriage does not become <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by reason of that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but the contracting parties to whom this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> end. And since <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in number, it follows that there can be an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of such <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> in <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>, some of which are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and some bad.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> and principal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; but that which has one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> and principal end may have several secondary <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> ends, and an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> ends.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The joining together can be taken for the relation itself which is marriage, and that is always from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, whatever be its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; or for the act of those who are being joined together, and thus it is sometimes <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and is not from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> simply. Nor is it unreasonable that an effect be from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of which is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, such as a child born of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>; for it is not from that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but as having some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in so far as it is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, although it is not from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> simply.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> whereby she intends to confer a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to each sacrament, so that if it be not observed, all <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are null. But the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> whereby she intends an advantage resulting from the sacrament belongs to the well-being and not to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; wherefore, if it be not observed, the sacrament is none the less valid. Yet he who omits this <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; for instance if in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> one intend not the healing of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> intends. In like manner he who intends to marry, although he fail to direct it to the end which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> intends, nevertheless contracts a valid marriage.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> This <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which is intended is the end not of marriage, but of the contracting parties.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The union itself, and not the action of those who are united, is the sign of the union of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: wherefore the conclusion does not follow.
