<h1>Question 48. The parts of prudence</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3048.htm#article1"> The three parts of prudence: integral, subjective, and potential</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether three parts of prudence are fittingly assigned?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the parts of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> are assigned unfittingly. Tully (De Invent. Rhet. ii, 53) assigns three parts of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, namely, "<a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>," "understanding" and "foresight." Macrobius (In Somn. Scip. i) following the opinion of Plotinus ascribes to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> six parts, namely, "reasoning," "understanding," "circumspection," "foresight," "docility" and "caution." <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> says (Ethic. vi, 9,10,11) that "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel," "synesis" and "gnome" belong to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Again under the head of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> he mentions "conjecture," "shrewdness," "sense" and "understanding." And another Greek philosopher [Andronicus; Cf. 80, Objection 4] says that ten things are connected with <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, namely, "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel," "shrewdness," "foresight," "regnative [Regnativa]," "military," "political" and "domestic <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>," "dialectics," "rhetoric" and "physics." Therefore it seems that one or the other enumeration is either excessive or deficient.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is specifically distinct from science. But politics, economics, <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>, rhetoric, physics are <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. Therefore they are not parts of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the parts do not exceed the whole. Now the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> or <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>, reason, sense and docility, belong not only to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> but also to all the cognitive <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>. Therefore they should not be set down as parts of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, just as counselling, judging and commanding are acts of the practical reason, so also is using, as stated above (I-II, 16, 1). Therefore, just as "eubulia" which refers to counsel, is connected with <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and "synesis" and "gnome" which refer to judgment, so also ought something to have been assigned corresponding to use.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, solicitude pertains to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, as stated above (Question 47, Article 09). Therefore solicitude also should have been mentioned among the parts of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Parts are of three kinds, namely, "integral," as wall, roof, and foundations are parts of a house; "subjective," as ox and lion are parts of animal; and "<a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a>," as the nutritive and sensitive powers are parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Accordingly, parts can be assigned to a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in three ways. First, in likeness to integral parts, so that the things which need to concur for the perfect act of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, are called the parts of that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. On this way, out of all the things mentioned above, eight may be taken as parts of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, namely, the six assigned by Macrobius; with the addition of a seventh, viz. "<a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>" mentioned by Tully; and <em>eustochia</em> or "shrewdness" mentioned by <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>. For the "sense" of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is also called "understanding": wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vi, 11): "Of such things one needs to have the sense, and this is understanding." Of these eight, five belong to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> as a cognitive <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, namely, "<a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>," "reasoning," "understanding," "docility" and "shrewdness": while the three others belong thereto, as commanding and applying <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to action, namely, "foresight," "circumspection" and "caution." The reason of their difference is seen from the fact that three things may be observed in reference to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. On the first place, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> itself, which, if it be of the past, is called "<a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>," if of the present, whether contingent or <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, is called "understanding" or "<a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>." Secondly, the acquiring of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> either by teaching, to which pertains "docility," or by "discovery," and to this belongs to <em>eustochia</em>, i.e. "a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> conjecture," of which "shrewdness" is a part, which is a "quick conjecture of the middle term," as stated in Poster. i, 9. Thirdly, the use of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, in as much as we proceed from things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or judgment of other things, and this belongs to "reasoning." And the reason, in order to command aright, requires to have three conditions. First, to order that which is befitting the end, and this belongs to "foresight"; secondly, to attend to the circumstances of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in hand, and this belongs to "circumspection"; thirdly, to avoid obstacles, and this belongs to "caution."

<p>The subjective parts of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are its various <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. On this way the parts of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, if we take them properly, are the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> whereby a man rules himself, and the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> whereby a man governs a multitude, which differ specifically as stated above (Question 47, Article 11). Again, the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> whereby a multitude is governed, is divided into various <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> according to the various kinds of multitude. There is the multitude which is united together for some particular purpose; thus an army is gathered together to fight, and the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> that governs this is called "military." There is also the multitude that is united together for the whole of life; such is the multitude of a home or <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and this is ruled by "domestic <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>": and such again is the multitude of a city or kingdom, the ruling principle of which is "regnative <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>" in the ruler, and "political <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>," simply so called, in the subjects.

<p>If, however, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> be taken in a wide sense, as including also speculative <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, as stated above (47, 2, ad 2) then its parts include "dialectics," "rhetoric" and "physics," according to three methods of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. The first of these is the attaining of science by demonstration, which belongs to "physics" (if physics be understood to comprise all demonstrative <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>). The second method is to arrive at an opinion through probable premises, and this belongs to "dialectics." The third method is to employ conjectures in order to induce a certain suspicion, or to persuade somewhat, and this belongs to "rhetoric." It may be said, however, that these three belong also to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> properly so called, since it argues sometimes from <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> premises, sometimes from probabilities, and sometimes from conjectures.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a> parts of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> connected with it, which are directed to certain secondary acts or matters, not having, as it were, the whole power of the principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. On this way the parts of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> are "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel," which concerns counsel, "synesis," which concerns judgment in matters of ordinary occurrence, and "gnome," which concerns judgment in matters of exception to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>: while "<a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>" is about the chief act, viz. that of commanding.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The various enumerations differ, either because different kinds of parts are assigned, or because that which is mentioned in one enumeration includes several mentioned in another enumeration. Thus Tully includes "caution" and "circumspection" under "foresight," and "reasoning," "docility" and "shrewdness" under "understanding."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Here domestic and civic <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> are not to be taken as <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, but as kinds of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. As to the other three, the reply may be gathered from what has been said.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> All these things are reckoned parts of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, not by taking them altogether, but in so far as they are connected with things pertaining to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Right command and right use always go together, because the reason's command is followed by obedience on the part of the lower powers, which pertain to use.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Solicitude is included under foresight.
