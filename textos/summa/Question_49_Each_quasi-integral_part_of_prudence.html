<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether memory is a part of prudence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> is not a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. For <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proves (De Memor. et Remin. i), is in the sensitive part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: whereas <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is in the rational part (Ethic. vi, 5). Therefore <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> is not a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is acquired and perfected by experience, whereas <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> is in us from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> is not a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> regards the past, whereas <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> regards future matters of action, about which counsel is concerned, as stated in Ethic. vi, 2,7. Therefore <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> is not a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Tully (De Invent. Rhet. ii, 53) places <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> among the parts of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">Prudence</a> regards contingent matters of action, as stated above (Question 47, Article 5). Now in such like matters a man can be directed, not by those things that are simply and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but by those which occur in the majority of cases: because principles must be proportionate to their conclusions, and "like must be concluded from like" (Ethic. vi [Anal. Post. i. 32). But we need experience to discover what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in the majority of cases: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 1) that "<a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is engendered and fostered by experience and time." Now experience is the result of many memories as stated in Metaph. i, 1, and therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> requires the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> of many things. Hence <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> is fittingly accounted a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (47, 3,6), <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> applies universal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to particulars which are objects of sense: hence many things belonging to the sensitive faculties are requisite for <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> is one of them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as aptitude for <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is in our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, while its perfection comes through practice or <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, so too, as Tully says in his Rhetoric [Ad Herenn. de Arte Rhet. iii, 16,24, <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> not only arises from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but is also aided by art and diligence.

<p>There are four things whereby a man perfects his <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>. First, when a man wishes to remember a thing, he should take some suitable yet somewhat unwonted illustration of it, since the unwonted strikes us more, and so makes a greater and stronger impression on the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>; the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>; and this explains why we remember better what we saw when we were children. Now the reason for the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of finding these illustrations or images, is that simple and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> impressions easily slip from the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, unless they be tied as it were to some corporeal image, because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> has a greater hold on sensible objects. For this reason <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> is assigned to the sensitive part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Secondly, whatever a man wishes to retain in his <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> he must carefully consider and set in order, so that he may pass easily from one <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> to another. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Memor. et Remin. ii): "Sometimes a place brings memories back to us: the reason being that we pass quickly from the one to the other." Thirdly, we must be anxious and earnest about the things we wish to remember, because the more a thing is impressed on the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, the less it is liable to slip out of it. Wherefore Tully says in his Rhetoric [Ad Herenn. de Arte Rhet. iii.] that "anxiety preserves the figures of images entire." Fourthly, we should often reflect on the things we wish to remember. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Memoria i) that "reflection preserves memories," because as he remarks (De Memoria ii) "custom is a second <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>": wherefore when we reflect on a thing frequently, we quickly call it to mind, through passing from one thing to another by a kind of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It behooves us to argue, as it were, about the future from the past; wherefore <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> of the past is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in order to take <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel for the future.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether understanding is a part of prudence?</h2> <span class="stiki">Understanding: Otherwise intuition; Aristotle's word is <em>nous</em></span>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that understanding is not a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. When two things are members of a division, one is not part of the other. But <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is divided into understanding and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, according to Ethic. vi, 3. Therefore understanding should not be reckoned a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, understanding is numbered among the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and corresponds to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as stated above (8, 1 and 8). But <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> other than <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as is clear from what has been said above (4, 8; I-II, 62, 2). Therefore understanding does not pertain to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is about singular matters of action (Ethic. vi, 7): whereas understanding takes cognizance of universal and immaterial objects (De Anima iii, 4). Therefore understanding is not a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Tully [De Invent. Rhet. ii, 53 accounts "<a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>" a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and Macrobius [In Somn. Scip. i, 8 mentions "understanding," which comes to the same.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Understanding denotes here, not the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> power, but the right estimate about some final principle, which is taken as self-evident: thus we are said to understand the first principles of demonstrations. Now every deduction of reason proceeds from certain statements which are taken as primary: wherefore every process of reasoning must needs proceed from some understanding. Therefore since <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is right reason applied to action, the whole process of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> must needs have its source in understanding. Hence it is that understanding is reckoned a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The reasoning of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> terminates, as in a conclusion, in the particular <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of action, to which, as stated above (47, A3,6), it applies the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of some universal principle. Now a singular conclusion is argued from a universal and a singular proposition. Wherefore the reasoning of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> must proceed from a twofold understanding. The one is cognizant of universals, and this belongs to the understanding which is an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, whereby we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> not only speculative principles, but also practical universal principles, such as "One should do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," as shown above (Question 47, Article 6). The other understanding, as stated in Ethic. vi, 11, is cognizant of an extreme, i.e. of some primary singular and contingent practical <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, viz. the minor premiss, which must needs be singular in the syllogism of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, as stated above (47, 3,6). Now this primary singular is some singular end, as stated in the same place. Wherefore the understanding which is a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is a right estimate of some particular end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The understanding which is a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, is a quick insight into divine things, as shown above (8, 1 and 2). It is in another sense that it is accounted a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The right estimate about a particular end is called both "understanding," in so far as its object is a principle, and "sense," in so far as its object is a particular. This is what the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> means when he says (Ethic. v, 11): "Of such things we need to have the sense, and this is understanding." But this is to be understood as referring, not to the particular sense whereby we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> proper sensibles, but to the interior sense, whereby we judge of a particular.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether docility should be accounted a part of prudence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that docility should not be accounted a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. For that which is a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of every <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, should not be appropriated to one of them. But docility is requisite for every <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore it should not be accounted a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which pertains to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is in our power, since it is for things that are in our power that we are praised or blamed. Now it is not in our power to be docile, for this is befitting to some through their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> disposition. Therefore it is not a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, docility is in the disciple: whereas <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, since it makes precepts, seems rather to belong to teachers, who are also called "preceptors." Therefore docility is not a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Macrobius [In Somn. Scip. i, 8 following the opinion of Plotinus places docility among the parts of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (2, ad 1; 47, 3) <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is concerned with particular matters of action, and since such matters are of <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> variety, no one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can consider them all sufficiently; nor can this be done quickly, for it requires length of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Hence in matters of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> stands in very great need of being taught by others, especially by old folk who have acquired a sane understanding of the ends in practical matters. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vi, 11): "It is right to pay no less attention to the undemonstrated assertions and opinions of such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> as are experienced, older than we are, and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>, than to their demonstrations, for their experience gives them an insight into principles." Thus it is written (<a href="../bible/pro003.htm#verse5">Proverbs 3:5</a>): "Lean not on thy own <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>," and (<a href="../bible/sir006.htm#verse35">Sirach 6:35</a>): "Stand in the multitude of the ancients" (i.e. the old men), "that are wise, and join thyself from thy heart to their wisdom." Now it is a mark of docility to be ready to be taught: and consequently docility is fittingly reckoned a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although docility is useful for every <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, yet it belongs to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> chiefly, for the reason given above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Man has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> aptitude for docility even as for other things connected with <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Yet his own efforts count for much towards the attainment of perfect docility: and he must carefully, frequently and reverently apply his mind to the teachings of the learned, neither neglecting them through laziness, nor despising them through <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> By <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> makes precepts not only for others, but also for himself, as stated above (47, 12, ad 3). Hence as stated (Ethic. vi, 11), even in subjects, there is place for <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>; to which docility pertains. And yet even the learned should be docile in some respects, since no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is altogether self-sufficient in matters of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, as stated above.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether shrewdness is part of prudence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that shrewdness is not a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. For shrewdness consists in easily finding the middle term for demonstrations, as stated in Poster. i, 34. Now the reasoning of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is not a demonstration since it deals with contingencies. Therefore shrewdness does not pertain to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel pertains to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> according to Ethic. vi, 5,7,9. Now there is no place in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel for shrewdness [Ethic. vi, 9; Poster. i, 34 which is a kind of <em>eustochia</em>, i.e. "a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> conjecture": for the latter is "unreasoning and rapid," whereas counsel needs to be slow, as stated in Ethic. vi, 9. Therefore shrewdness should not be accounted a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, shrewdness as stated above (<a href="#48">Article 48</a>) is a "<a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> conjecture." Now it belongs to rhetoricians to make use of conjectures. Therefore shrewdness belongs to rhetoric rather than to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. x): "A solicitous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is one who is shrewd and alert [solers citus]." But solicitude belongs to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, as stated above (Question 47, Article 09). Therefore shrewdness does also.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">Prudence</a> consists in a right estimate about matters of action. Now a right estimate or opinion is acquired in two ways, both in practical and in speculative matters, first by discovering it oneself, secondly by learning it from others. Now just as docility consists in a man being well disposed to acquire a right opinion from another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, so shrewdness is an apt disposition to acquire a right estimate by oneself, yet so that shrewdness be taken for <em>eustochia</em>, of which it is a part. For <em>eustochia</em> is a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> conjecture about any <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, while shrewdness is "an easy and rapid conjecture in finding the middle term" (Poster. i, 34). Nevertheless the philosopher [Andronicus; Cf. 48, Objection 1] who calls shrewdness a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, takes it for <em>eustochia</em>, in general, hence he says: "Shrewdness is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> whereby congruities are discovered rapidly."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Shrewdness is concerned with the discovery of the middle term not only in demonstrative, but also in practical syllogisms, as, for instance, when two men are seen to be friends they are reckoned to be enemies of a third one, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Poster. i, 34). On this way shrewdness belongs to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> adduces the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> reason (Ethic. vi, 9) to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that <em>euboulia</em>, i.e. <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel, is not <em>eustochia</em>, which is commended for grasping quickly what should be done. Now a man may take <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel, though he be long and slow in so doing, and yet this does not discount the utility of a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> conjecture in taking <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel: indeed it is sometimes a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, when, for instance, something has to be done without warning. It is for this reason that shrewdness is fittingly reckoned a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Rhetoric also reasons about practical matters, wherefore nothing hinders the same thing belonging both to rhetoric and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Nevertheless, conjecture is taken here not only in the sense in which it is employed by rhetoricians, but also as applicable to all matters whatsoever wherein <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is said to conjecture the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether reason should be reckoned a part of prudence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that reason should not be reckoned a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. For the subject of an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> is not a part thereof. But <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is in the reason as its subject (Ethic. vi, 5). Therefore reason should not be reckoned a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which is common to many, should not be reckoned a part of any one of them; or if it be so reckoned, it should be reckoned a part of that one to which it chiefly belongs. Now reason is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in all the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and chiefly in wisdom and science, which employ a demonstrative reason. Therefore reason should not be reckoned a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, reason as a power does not differ <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> from the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>, as stated above (I, 79, 8). If therefore <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> be reckoned a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, it is superfluous to add reason.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Macrobius [In Somn. Scip. i], following the opinion of Plotinus, numbers reason among the parts of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The work of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is to take <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel, as stated in Ethic. vi, 7. Now counsel is a research proceeding from certain things to others. But this is the work of reason. Wherefore it is requisite for <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be an apt reasoner. And since the things required for the perfection of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> are called requisite or quasi-integral parts of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, it follows that reason should be numbered among these parts.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason</a> denotes here, not the power of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, but its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> use.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> of reason comes from the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Yet the need of reason is from a defect in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, since those things in which the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> power is in full vigor, have no need for reason, for they comprehend the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by their simple insight, as do <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. On the other hand particular matters of action, wherein <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> guides, are very far from the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of things intelligible, and so much the farther, as they are less certain and fixed. Thus matters of art, though they are singular, are nevertheless more fixed and certain, wherefore in many of them there is no room for counsel on account of their <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a>, as stated in Ethic. iii, 3. Hence, although in certain other <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> reason is more <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> than in <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, yet <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> above all requires that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be an apt reasoner, so that he may rightly apply universals to particulars, which latter are various and uncertain.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> and reason are not different powers, yet they are named after different acts. For <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> takes its name from being an intimate penetration of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> [Cf. II-II, 08, 1, while reason is so called from being inquisitive and discursive. Hence each is accounted a part of reason as explained above (2; 47, 2,3).

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether foresight should be accounted a part of prudence?</h2>

<p><span class="stiki">Foresight: "Providentia," which may be translated either "providence" or "foresight."</span>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that foresight should not be accounted a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. For nothing is part of itself. Now foresight seems to be the same as <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, because according to <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> (Etym. x), "a <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is one who sees from afar [porro videns]": and this is also the derivation of "providentia [foresight]," according to <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> (De Consol. v). Therefore foresight is not a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is only practical, whereas foresight may be also speculative, because "seeing," whence we have the word "to foresee," has more to do with speculation than operation. Therefore foresight is not a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the chief act of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is to command, while its secondary act is to judge and to take counsel. But none of these seems to be properly implied by foresight. Therefore foresight is not part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary</strong> stands the authority of Tully and Macrobius, who number foresight among the parts of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, as stated above (<a href="#48">Article 48</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (47, 1, ad 2, 6,13), <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is properly about the means to an end, and its proper work is to set them in due order to the end. And although certain things are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for an end, which are subject to <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a>, yet nothing is subject to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> except the contingent matters of actions which can be done by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for an end. Now the past has become a kind of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, since what has been done cannot be undone. On like manner, the present as such, has a kind of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, since it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> sit, so long as he sits.

<p>Consequently, future contingents, in so far as they can be directed by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to the end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, are the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>: and each of these things is implied in the word foresight, for it implies the notion of something distant, to which that which occurs in the present has to be directed. Therefore foresight is part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Whenever many things are requisite for a unity, one of them must needs be the principal to which all the others are subordinate. Hence in every whole one part must be formal and predominant, whence the whole has unity. Accordingly foresight is the principal of all the parts of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, since whatever else is required for <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> precisely that some particular thing may be rightly directed to its end. Hence it is that the very name of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is taken from foresight [providentia] as from its principal part.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Speculation is about universal and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> things, which, in themselves, are not distant, since they are everywhere and always, though they are distant from us, in so far as we fail to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them. Hence foresight does not apply properly to speculative, but only to practical matters.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Right order to an end which is included in the notion of foresight, contains rectitude of counsel, judgment and command, without which no right order to the end is possible.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether circumspection can be a part of prudence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that circumspection cannot be a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. For circumspection seems to signify looking at one's surroundings. But these are of <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number, and cannot be considered by the reason wherein is <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Therefore circumspection should not be reckoned a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, circumstances seem to be the concern of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> rather than of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. But circumspection seems to denote nothing but attention to circumstances. Therefore circumspection apparently belongs to the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> rather than to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whoever can see things afar off can much more see things that are near. Now foresight enables a man to look on distant things. Therefore there is no need to account circumspection a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> in addition to foresight.

<p><strong>On the contrary</strong> stands the authority of Macrobius, quoted above (<a href="#48">Article 48</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#6">Article 6</a>), it belongs to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> chiefly to direct something aright to an end; and this is not done aright unless both the end be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and the means <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and suitable.

<p>Since, however, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, as stated above (Question 47, Article 3) is about singular matters of action, which contain many combinations of circumstances, it happens that a thing is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in itself and suitable to the end, and nevertheless becomes <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> or unsuitable to the end, by reason of some combination of circumstances. Thus to show signs of love to someone seems, considered in itself, to be a fitting way to arouse love in his heart, yet if <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> or suspicion of flattery arise in his heart, it will no longer be a means suitable to the end. Hence the need of circumspection in <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, viz. of comparing the means with the circumstances.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Though the number of possible circumstances be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, the number of actual circumstances is not; and the judgment of reason in matters of action is influenced by things which are few in number

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Circumstances are the concern of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, because <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> has to fix them; on the other hand they are the concern of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, in so far as moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are perfected by the fixing of circumstances.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Just as it belongs to foresight to look on that which is by its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> suitable to an end, so it belongs to circumspection to consider whether it be suitable to the end in view of the circumstances. Now each of these presents a difficulty of its own, and therefore each is reckoned a distinct part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether caution should be reckoned a part of prudence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that caution should not be reckoned a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. For when no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is possible, no caution is required. Now no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> makes <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> use of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> declares (De Lib. Arb. ii, 19). Therefore caution does not belong to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> which directs the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to foresee <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and to avoid <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> belong to the same faculty, just as the same art gives health and cures ill-health. Now it belongs to foresight to foresee <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and consequently, also to avoid <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore caution should not be accounted a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, distinct from foresight.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> strives for the impossible. But no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can take precautions against all possible <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. Therefore caution does not belong to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse15">Ephesians 5:15</a>): "See how you walk cautiously [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'circumspectly']."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The things with which <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is concerned, are contingent matters of action, wherein, even as <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> is found with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, so is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> mingled with <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, on account of the great variety of these matters of action, wherein <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is often hindered by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> has the appearance of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> needs caution, so that we may have such a grasp of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as to avoid <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Caution is required in moral acts, that we may be on our guard, not against acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but against the hindrance of acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is the same in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, to ensue <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and to avoid the opposite <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but the avoidance of outward hindrances is different in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>. Hence caution differs from foresight, although they both belong to the one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has to avoid, some are of frequent occurrence; the like can be grasped by reason, and against them caution is directed, either that they may be avoided altogether, or that they may do less harm. Others there are that occur rarely and by chance, and these, since they are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in number, cannot be grasped by reason, nor is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> able to take precautions against them, although by exercising <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> he is able to prepare against all the surprises of chance, so as to suffer less harm thereby.
