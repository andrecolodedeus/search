<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether habit is a quality?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. lxxxiii, qu. 73): "this word '<a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>' is derived from the verb 'to have.'" But "to have" belongs not only to <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, but also to the other categories: for we speak of ourselves as "having" <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> and money and other like things. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is reckoned as one of the predicaments; as may be clearly seen in the Book of the Predicaments (Categor. vi). But one predicament is not contained under another. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "every <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is a disposition," as is stated in the Book of the Predicaments (Categor. vi). Now disposition is "the order of that which has parts," as stated in Metaph. v, text. 24. But this belongs to the predicament Position. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says in the Book of Predicaments (Categor. vi) that "<a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> which is difficult to change."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> This word "habitus" [<a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>] is derived from "habere" [to have]. Now <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is taken from this word in two ways; in one way, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, or any other thing, is said to "have" something; in another way, inasmuch as a particular thing has a relation [se habet] either in regard to itself, or in regard to something else.

<p>Concerning the first, we must observe that "to have," as said in regard to anything that is "had," is common to the various predicaments. And so the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> puts "to have" among the "post-predicaments," so called because they result from the various predicaments; as, for instance, opposition, priority, posterity, and such like. Now among things which are had, there seems to be this distinction, that there are some in which there is no medium between the "haver" and that which is had: as, for instance, there is no medium between the subject and <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> or <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. Then there are some in which there is a medium, but only a relation: as, for instance, a man is said to have a companion or a friend. And, further, there are some in which there is a medium, not indeed an action or passion, but something after the manner of action or passion: thus, for instance, something adorns or covers, and something else is adorned or covered: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. v, text. 25) that "a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is said to be, as it were, an action or a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the haver and that which is had"; as is the case in those things which we have about ourselves. And therefore these constitute a special genus of things, which are comprised under the predicament of "<a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>": of which the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. v, text. 25) that "there is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> between clothing and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who is clothed."

<p>But if "to have" be taken according as a thing has a relation in regard to itself or to something else; in that case <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>; since this mode of having is in respect of some <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>: and of this the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. v, text. 25) that "<a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is a disposition whereby that which is disposed is disposed well or ill, and this, either in regard to itself or in regard to another: thus health is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>." And in this sense we speak of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> now. Wherefore we must say that <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument takes "to have" in the general sense: for thus it is common to many predicaments, as we have said.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument takes <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> in the sense in which we understand it to be a medium between the haver, and that which is had: and in this sense it is a predicament, as we have said.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Disposition does always, indeed, imply an order of that which has parts: but this happens in three ways, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> goes on at once to say (Metaph. v, text. 25): namely, "either as to place, or as to power, or as to <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>." "In saying this," as Simplicius observes in his Commentary on the Predicaments, "he includes all dispositions: bodily dispositions, when he says 'as to place,'" and this belongs to the predicament "Position," which is the order of parts in a place: "when he says 'as to power,' he includes all those dispositions which are in course of formation and not yet arrived at perfect usefulness," such as inchoate science and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: "and when he says, 'as to <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>,' he includes perfect dispositions, which are called <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>," such as perfected science and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether habit is a distinct species of quality?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is not a distinct <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>. Because, as we have said (1), <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, in so far as it is a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, is "a disposition whereby that which is disposed is disposed well or ill." But this happens in regard to any <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>: for a thing happens to be well or ill disposed in regard also to shape, and in like manner, in regard to heat and cold, and in regard to all such things. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is not a distinct <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says in the Book of the Predicaments (Categor. vi), that heat and cold are dispositions or <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, just as sickness and health. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> or disposition is not distinct from the other <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "difficult to change" is not a difference belonging to the predicament of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, but rather to movement or passion. Now, no genus should be contracted to a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> by a difference of another genus; but "differences should be proper to a genus," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says in Metaph. vii, text. 42. Therefore, since <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is "a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> difficult to change," it seems not to be a distinct <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says in the Book of the Predicaments (Categor. vi) that "one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> is <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> and disposition."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> in the Book of Predicaments (Categor. vi) reckons disposition and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> as the first <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>. Now Simplicius, in his Commentary on the Predicaments, explains the difference of these <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> as follows. He says "that some <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, and are in their subject in virtue of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and are always there: but some are adventitious, being <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> from without, and these can be lost. Now the latter," i.e. those which are adventitious, "are <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> and dispositions, differing in the point of being easily or difficultly lost. As to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>, some regard a thing in the point of its being in a state of <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>; and thus we have the second <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>: while others regard a thing which is in act; and this either deeply rooted therein or only on its surface. If deeply rooted, we have the third <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>: if on the surface, we have the fourth <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, as shape, and form which is the shape of an animated being." But this distinction of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> seems unsuitable. For there are many shapes, and passion-like <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>, which are not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> but adventitious: and there are also many dispositions which are not adventitious but <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, as health, beauty, and the like. Moreover, it does not suit the order of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, since that which is the more <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> is always first.

<p>Therefore we must explain otherwise the distinction of dispositions and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> from other <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>. For <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, properly speaking, implies a certain mode of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Now mode, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. iv, 3), "is that which a measure determines": wherefore it implies a certain determination according to a certain measure. Therefore, just as that in accordance with which the material <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> [potentia materiae] is determined to its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> being, is called <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, which is a difference affecting the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, so that, in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> of the subject is determined to its <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> being, is called an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, which is also a kind of difference, as is clear from the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. v, text. 19).

<p>Now the mode of determination of the subject to <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> being may be taken in regard to the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the subject, or in regard to action, and passion resulting from its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> principles, which are <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>; or again in regard to <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. If we take the mode or determination of the subject in regard to <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, we shall then have the fourth <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>. And because <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, considered in itself, is devoid of movement, and does not imply the notion of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, so it does not concern the fourth <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> whether a thing be well or ill disposed, nor quickly or slowly transitory.

<p>But the mode of determination of the subject, in regard to action or passion, is considered in the second and third <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>. And therefore in both, we take into account whether a thing be done with ease or difficulty; whether it be transitory or lasting. But in them, we do not consider anything pertaining to the notion of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: because movements and <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> have not the aspect of an end, whereas <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> are said in respect of an end.

<p>On the other hand, the mode or determination of the subject, in regard to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the thing, belongs to the first <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> and disposition: for the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Phys. vii, text. 17), when speaking of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and of the body, that they are "dispositions of the perfect to the best; and by perfect I mean that which is disposed in accordance with its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." And since the form itself and the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a thing is the end and the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> why a thing is made (Phys. ii, text. 25), therefore in the first <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> we consider both <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and also changeableness, whether easy or difficult; inasmuch as a certain <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is the end of generation and movement. And so the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. v, text. 25) defines <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, a "disposition whereby someone is disposed, well or ill"; and in Ethic. ii, 4, he says that by "<a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> we are directed well or ill in reference to the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>." For when the mode is suitable to the thing's <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it has the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: and when it is unsuitable, it has the aspect of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And since <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is the first object of consideration in anything, for this reason <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is reckoned as the first <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Disposition implies a certain order, as stated above (1, ad 3). Wherefore a man is not said to be disposed by some <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> except in relation to something else. And if we add "well or ill," which belongs to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> notion of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, we must consider the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality's</a> relation to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which is the end. So in regard to shape, or heat, or cold, a man is not said to be well or ill disposed, except by reason of a relation to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a thing, with regard to its suitability or unsuitability. Consequently even shapes and passion-like <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>, in so far as they are considered to be suitable or unsuitable to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a thing, belong to <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> or dispositions: for shape and color, according to their suitability to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of thing, concern beauty; while heat and cold, according to their suitability to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a thing, concern health. And in this way heat and cold are put, by the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a>, in the first <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>.

<p>Wherefore it is clear how to answer the second objection: though some give another solution, as Simplicius says in his Commentary on the Predicaments.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This difference, "difficult to change," does not distinguish <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> from the other <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, but from disposition. Now disposition may be taken in two ways; in one way, as the genus of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, for disposition is included in the definition of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> (Metaph. v, text. 25): in another way, according as it is divided against <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. Again, disposition, properly so called, can be divided against <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> in two ways: first, as perfect and imperfect within the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; and thus we call it a disposition, retaining the name of the genus, when it is had imperfectly, so as to be easily lost: whereas we call it a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, when it is had perfectly, so as not to be lost easily. And thus a disposition becomes a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, just as a boy becomes a man. Secondly, they may be distinguished as diverse <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the one subaltern genus: so that we call dispositions, those <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> of the first <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, which by reason of their very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> are easily lost, because they have changeable <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>; e.g. sickness and health: whereas we call <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> those <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> which, by reason of their very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, are not easily changed, in that they have unchangeable <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, e.g. <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. And in this sense, disposition does not become <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. The latter explanation seems more in keeping with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>: for in order to confirm this distinction he adduces the common mode of speaking, according to which, when a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> is, by reason of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, easily changeable, and, through some <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, becomes difficultly changeable, then it is called a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>: while the contrary happens in regard to <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>, by reason of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, difficultly changeable: for supposing a man to have a science imperfectly, so as to be liable to lose it easily, we say that he is disposed to that science, rather than that he has the science. From this it is clear that the word "<a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>" implies a certain lastingness: while the word "disposition" does not.

<p>Nor does it matter that thus to be easy and difficult to change are specific differences (of a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>), although they belong to passion and movement, and not the genus of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>. For these differences, though apparently <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, nevertheless designate differences which are proper and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>. In the same way, in the genus of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> we often take <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> instead of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> differences, in so far as by the former, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> principles are designated.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether habit implies order to an act?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> does not imply order to an act. For everything acts according as it is in act. But the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii, text 8), that "when one is become <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> by <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, one is still in a state of <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, but otherwise than before learning." Therefore <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> does not imply the relation of a principle to an act.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which is put in the definition of a thing, belongs to it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>. But to be a principle of action, is put in the definition of power, as we read in Metaph. v, text. 17. Therefore to be the principle of an act belongs to power <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>. Now that which is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> is first in every genus. If therefore, <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> also is a principle of act, it follows that it is posterior to power. And so <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> and disposition will not be the first <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, health is sometimes a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, and so are leanness and beauty. But these do not indicate relation to an act. Therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> to be a principle of act.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Bono Conjug. xxi) that "<a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is that whereby something is done when <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>." And the <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Commentator</a> says (De Anima iii) that "<a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is that whereby we act when we will."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> To have relation to an act may belong to <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, both in regard to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, and in regard to the subject in which the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is. In regard to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, it belongs to every <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> to have relation to an act. For it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> to imply some relation to a thing's <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, in so far as it is suitable or unsuitable thereto. But a thing's <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which is the end of generation, is further ordained to another end, which is either an operation, or the product of an operation, to which one attains by means of operation. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> implies relation not only to the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a thing, but also, consequently, to operation, inasmuch as this is the end of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, or conducive to the end. Whence also it is stated (Metaph. v, text. 25) in the definition of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, that it is a disposition whereby that which is disposed, is well or ill disposed either in regard to itself, that is to its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, or in regard to something else, that is to the end.

<p>But there are some <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, which even on the part of the subject in which they are, imply primarily and principally relation to an act. For, as we have said, <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> primarily and of itself implies a relation to the thing's <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. If therefore the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a thing, in which the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is, consists in this very relation to an act, it follows that the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> principally implies relation to an act. Now it is clear that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and the notion of power is that it should be a principle of act. Wherefore every <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is subjected in a power, implies principally relation to an act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Habit is an act, in so far as it is a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>: and in this respect it can be a principle of operation. It is, however, in a state of <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> in respect to operation. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is called first act, and operation, second act; as it is explained in De Anima ii, text. 5.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is not the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> to be related to power, but to be related to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. And as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> precedes action, to which power is related, therefore <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is put before power as a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Health is said to be a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, or a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> disposition, in relation to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as stated above. But in so far as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is a principle of act, it consequently implies a relation to act. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Hist. Animal. x, 1), that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, or one of his members, is called healthy, "when he can perform the operation of a healthy <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." And the same applies to other <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether habits are necessary?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. For by <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> we are well or ill disposed in respect of something, as stated above. But a thing is well or ill disposed by its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>: for in respect of its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> a thing is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, even as it is a being. Therefore there is no <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> for <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> implies relation to an act. But power implies sufficiently a principle of act: for even the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers, without any <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, are principles of acts. Therefore there was no <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> for <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as power is related to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, so also is <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>: and as power does not always act, so neither does <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. Given, therefore, the powers, <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> become superfluous.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Habits are perfections (Phys. vii, text. 17). But perfection is of the greatest <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> to a thing: since it is in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an end. Therefore it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that there should be <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As we have said above (2,3), <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> implies a disposition in relation to a thing's <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and to its operation or end, by reason of which disposition a thing is well or ill disposed thereto. Now for a thing to need to be disposed to something else, three <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> is that which is disposed should be distinct from that to which it is disposed; and so, that it should be related to it as <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> is to act. Whence, if there is a being whose <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not composed of <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> and act, and whose <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is its own operation, which itself is for itself, there we can find no room for <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> and disposition, as is clearly the case in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>The second <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> is, that that which is in a state of <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> in regard to something else, be capable of determination in several ways and to various things. Whence if something be in a state of <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> in regard to something else, but in regard to that only, there we find no room for disposition and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>: for such a subject from its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> has the due relation to such an act. Wherefore if a heavenly body be composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, since that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is not in a state of <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to another form, as we said in the I, 56, 2, there is no need for disposition or <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> in respect of the form, or even in respect of operation, since the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the heavenly body is not in a state of <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to more than one fixed movement.

<p>The third <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> is that in disposing the subject to one of those things to which it is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, several things should occur, capable of being adjusted in various ways: so as to dispose the subject well or ill to its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> or to its operation. Wherefore the simple <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> of the elements which suit the natures of the elements in one single fixed way, are not called dispositions or <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, but "simple <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>": but we call dispositions or <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, such things as health, beauty, and so forth, which imply the adjustment of several things which may vary in their relative adjustability. For this reason the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. v, text. 24,25) that "<a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is a disposition": and disposition is "the order of that which has parts either as to place, or as to <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, or as to <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>," as we have said above (1, ad 3). Wherefore, since there are many things for whose natures and operations several things must concur which may vary in their relative adjustability, it follows that <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> By the form the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a thing is perfected: yet the subject needs to be disposed in regard to the form by some disposition. But the form itself is further ordained to operation, which is either the end, or the means to the end. And if the form is limited to one fixed operation, no further disposition, besides the form itself, is needed for the operation. But if the form be such that it can operate in diverse ways, as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; it needs to be disposed to its operations by means of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Power sometimes has a relation to many things: and then it needs to be determined by something else. But if a power has not a relation to many things, it does not need a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> to determine it, as we have said. For this reason the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> forces do not perform their operations by means of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>: because they are of themselves determined to one mode of operation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The same <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> has not a relation to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as will be made clear further on (54, 3): whereas the same power has a relation to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And, therefore, <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the powers be determined to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.
