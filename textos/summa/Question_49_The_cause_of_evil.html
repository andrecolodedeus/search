<h1>Question 49. The cause of evil</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1049.htm#article1"> Can good be the cause of evil?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1049.htm#article2"> Is the supreme good, God, the cause of evil?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1049.htm#article3"> Is there any supreme evil, which is the first cause of all evils?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether good can be the cause of evil?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> cannot be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For it is said (<a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse18">Matthew 7:18</a>): "A <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> tree cannot bring forth <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> fruit."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, one contrary cannot be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of another. But <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is the contrary to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> cannot be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a deficient effect can proceed only from a deficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is a deficient effect. Therefore its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, if it has one, is deficient. But everything deficient is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> can only be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> has no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Julian. i, 9): "There is no possible source of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> except <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It must be said that every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in some way has a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. For <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is the absence of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and due to a thing. But that anything fail from its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and due disposition can come only from some <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> drawing it out of its proper disposition. For a heavy thing is not moved upwards except by some impelling force; nor does an agent fail in its action except from some impediment. But only <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> can be a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; because nothing can be a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> except inasmuch as it is a being, and every being, as such, is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p>And if we consider the special kinds of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, we see that the agent, the form, and the end, import some kind of perfection which belongs to the notion of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Even <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as a <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by way of the material <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> was shown above (Question 48, Article 3). For it was shown that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is the subject of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> has no <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">formal</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, rather is it a privation of form; likewise, neither has it a final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but rather is it a privation of order to the proper end; since not only the end has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but also the useful, which is ordered to the end. <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">Evil</a>, however, has a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> by way of an agent, not directly, but <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this, we must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in the action otherwise than in the effect. In the action <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by reason of the defect of some principle of action, either of the principal or the instrumental agent; thus the defect in the movement of an animal may happen by reason of the weakness of the motive power, as in the case of children, or by reason only of the ineptitude of the instrument, as in the lame. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in a thing, but not in the proper effect of the agent, sometimes by the power of the agent, sometimes by reason of a defect, either of the agent or of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by reason of the power or perfection of the agent when there <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> follows on the form intended by the agent the privation of another form; as, for instance, when on the form of fire there follows the privation of the form of air or of water. Therefore, as the more perfect the fire is in strength, so much the more perfectly does it impress its own form, so also the more perfectly does it corrupt the contrary. Hence that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and corruption befall air and water comes from the perfection of the fire: but this is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>; because fire does not aim at the privation of the form of water, but at the bringing in of its own form, though by doing this it also <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the other. But if there is a defect in the proper effect of the fire--as, for instance, that it fails to heat--this comes either by defect of the action, which implies the defect of some principle, as was said above, or by the indisposition of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, which does not receive the action of the fire, the agent. But this very fact that it is a deficient being is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to which of itself it belongs to act. Hence it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in no way has any but an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; and thus is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Julian. i): "The Lord calls an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> tree, and a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> tree." Now, a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will does not produce a morally bad act, since it is from the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will itself that a moral act is judged to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Nevertheless the movement itself of an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the rational creature, which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and thus <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Good does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which is contrary to itself, but some other <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: thus the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the fire <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to the water, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as to his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> an act morally <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And, as explained above (Question 19, Article 9), this is by <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>. Moreover, it does happen sometimes that one contrary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> another by <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>: for instance, the exterior surrounding cold heats (the body) through the concentration of the inward heat.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">Evil</a> has a deficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> in <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> things otherwise than in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things. For the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> agent produces the same kind of effect as it is itself, unless it is impeded by some exterior thing; and this amounts to some defect belonging to it. Hence <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> never follows in the effect, unless some other <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in the agent or in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as was said above. But in <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> things the defect of the action comes from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> actually deficient, inasmuch as it does not actually subject itself to its proper rule. This defect, however, is not a fault, but fault follows upon it from the fact that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> acts with this defect.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">Evil</a> has no direct <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but only an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as was said above.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the supreme good, God, is the cause of evil?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For it is said (<a href="../bible/isa045.htm#verse5">Isaiah 45:5-7</a>): "I am the Lord, and there is no other <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, forming the light, and creating darkness, making peace, and creating <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." And <a href="../bible/amo003.htm#verse6">Amos 3:6</a>, "Shall there be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in a city, which the Lord hath not done?"

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the effect of the secondary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is reduced to the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as was said above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore, since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as was shown above (2, 3; 6, 1,4), it follows that also every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as is said by the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Phys. ii, text 30), the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of both safety and danger of the ship is the same. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the safety of all things. Therefore He is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all perdition and of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. 83, qu. 21), that, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the author of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> because He is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of tending to not-being."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As appears from what was said (1), the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which consists in the defect of action is always <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the defect of the agent. But in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is no defect, but the highest perfection, as was shown above (Question 4, Article 1). Hence, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which consists in defect of action, or which is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by defect of the agent, is not reduced to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as to its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p>But the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which consists in the corruption of some things is reduced to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. And this appears as regards both <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things and <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> things. For it was said (1) that some agent inasmuch as it produces by its power a form to which follows corruption and defect, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> by its power that corruption and defect. But it is manifest that the form which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> chiefly intends in things <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the order of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. Now, the order of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> requires, as was said above (22, 2, ad 2; 48, 2), that there should be some things that can, and do sometimes, fail. And thus <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> in things the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the order of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, consequently and as it were by <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the corruptions of things, according to <a href="../bible/1sa002.htm#verse6">1 Samuel 2:6</a>: "The Lord killeth and maketh alive." But when we read that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath not made death" (<a href="../bible/wis001.htm#verse13">Wisdom 1:13</a>), the sense is that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not will death for its own sake. Nevertheless the order of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> belongs to the order of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>; and this requires that penalty should be dealt out to sinners. And so <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the author of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which is penalty, but not of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which is fault, by reason of what is said above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> These passages refer to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of penalty, and not to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of fault.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The effect of the deficient secondary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is reduced to the first non-deficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> as regards what it has of being and perfection, but not as regards what it has of defect; just as whatever there is of motion in the act of limping is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the motive power, whereas what there is of obliqueness in it does not come from the motive power, but from the curvature of the leg. And, likewise, whatever there is of being and action in a bad action, is reduced to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; whereas whatever defect is in it is not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but by the deficient secondary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The sinking of a ship is attributed to the sailor as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, from the fact that he does not fulfil what the safety of the ship requires; but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not fail in doing what is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the safety of all. Hence there is no parity.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether there be one supreme evil which is the cause of every evil?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is one supreme <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For contrary effects have contrary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. But contrariety is found in things, according to <a href="../bible/sir033.htm#verse15">Sirach 33:15</a>: "Good is set against <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and life against death; so also is the sinner against a just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." Therefore there are many contrary principles, one of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, the other of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if one contrary is in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, so is the other. But the <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a> is in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as was shown above (2, 3; 6, 2,4). Therefore, also, there is a supreme <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> opposed to it as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as we find <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and better things, so we find <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and worse. But <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and better are so considered in relation to what is best. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and worse are so considered in relation to some supreme <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, everything participated is reduced to what is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a>. But things which are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> among us are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, but by participation. Therefore we must seek for some supreme <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, whatever is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> is reduced to that which is "per se." But <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore, we must suppose some supreme <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which is the "per se" <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. Nor can it be said that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> has no "per se" <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but only an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; for it would then follow that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> would not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the many, but only in the few.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of the effect is reduced to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; because the deficient effect comes from the deficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as was said above (1,2). But we cannot proceed to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> in this matter. Therefore, we must suppose one first <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of every being, as was shown above (2, 3; 6, 4). Therefore there cannot be any principle opposed to it as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It appears from what precedes that there is no one first principle of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as there is one first principle of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p>First, indeed, because the first principle of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as was shown above (6, 3,4). But nothing can be <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> bad. For it was shown above that every being, as such, is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> (5, 3); and that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> can <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> only in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as in its subject (48, 3).

<p>Secondly, because the first principle of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is the highest and perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which pre-contains in itself all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, as shown above (Question 6, Article 2). But there cannot be a supreme <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; because, as was shown above (Question 48, Article 4), although <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> always lessens <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, yet it never wholly consumes it; and thus, while <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> ever remains, nothing can be wholly and perfectly bad. Therefore, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 5) that "if the wholly <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> could be, it would destroy itself"; because all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> being destroyed (which it need be for something to be wholly <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>), <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> itself would be taken away, since its subject is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p>Thirdly, because the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is against the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a first principle; both because every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as was shown above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), and because <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> can be only an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and thus it cannot be the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is subsequent to the direct <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p>Those, however, who upheld two first principles, one <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and the other <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, fell into this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> from the same <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, whence also arose other strange notions of the ancients; namely, because they failed to consider the universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all being, and considered only the particular <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of particular effects. For on that account, if they found a thing hurtful to something by the power of its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, they thought that the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of that thing was <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; as, for instance, if one should say that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of fire was <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> because it burnt the house of a poor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. The judgment, however, of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of anything does not depend upon its order to any particular thing, but rather upon what it is in itself, and on its order to the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, wherein every part has its own perfectly ordered place, as was said above (47, 2, ad 1).

<p>Likewise, because they found two contrary particular <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of two contrary particular effects, they did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to reduce these contrary particular <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> to the universal common <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; and therefore they extended the contrariety of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> even to the first principles. But since all contraries agree in something common, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to search for one common <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for them above their own contrary proper <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>; as above the contrary <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> of the elements <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> the power of a heavenly body; and above all things that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, no matter how, there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> one first principle of being, as was shown above (Question 2, Article 3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Contraries agree in one genus, and they also agree in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of being; and therefore, although they have contrary particular <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, nevertheless we must come at last to one first common <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Privation and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> belong <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> to the same subject. Now the subject of privation is a being in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, as was said above (Question 48, Article 3). Hence, since <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is privation of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as appears from what was said above (48, 1, 2,3), it is opposed to that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which has some <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, but not to the <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a>, who is <a href="../cathen/01125b.htm">pure act</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Increase in intensity is in proportion to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a thing. And as the form is a perfection, so privation removes a perfection. Hence every form, perfection, and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is intensified by approach to the perfect term; but privation and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by receding from that term. Hence a thing is not said to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and worse, by reason of access to the supreme <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, in the same way as it is said to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and better, by reason of access to the <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> No being is called <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by participation, but by privation of participation. Hence it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to reduce it to any <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">Evil</a> can only have an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as was shown above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Hence reduction to any 'per se' <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is impossible. And to say that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is in the greater number is simply <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. For things which are generated and corrupted, in which alone can there be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, are the smaller part of the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. And again, in every <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> the defect of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is in the smaller number. In <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> alone does <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> appear as in the greater number; because the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as regards the senses is not the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>--that is, in regard to reason; and more men seek <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in regard to the senses than <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> according to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> we do not proceed to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>, but reduce all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> to some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, whence <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> follows <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>.
