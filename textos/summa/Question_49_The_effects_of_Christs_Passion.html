<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether we were delivered from sin through Christ's Passion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that we were not delivered from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>. For to deliver from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, according to <a href="../bible/isa043.htm#verse25">Isaiah 43:25</a>: "I am He who blot out your iniquities for My own sake." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not suffer as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> did not free us from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, what is corporeal does not act upon what is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> is corporeal, whereas <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> creature. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> could not cleanse us from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, one cannot be purged from a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not yet committed, but which shall be committed hereafter. Since, then, many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> have been committed since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death, and are being committed daily, it seems that we were not delivered from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, given an efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, nothing else is required for producing the effect. But other things besides are required for the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, such as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and penance. Consequently it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> is not the sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/pro010.htm#verse12">Proverbs 10:12</a>): "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> covereth all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>"; and (<a href="../bible/pro015.htm#verse27">Proverbs 15:27</a>): "By mercy and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are purged away." But there are many other things of which we have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and which excite <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> is not the proper <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/rev001.htm#verse5">Apocalypse 1:5</a>): "He loved us, and washed us from our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in His own blood."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> is the proper <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in three ways. First of all, by way of exciting our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, because, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse8">Romans 5:8</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> commendeth His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> towards us: because when as yet we were sinners, according to the time, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> died for us." But it is by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> that we procure pardon of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, according to <a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse47">Luke 7:47</a>: "Many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven her because she hath loved much." Secondly, <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by way of redemption. For since He is our head, then, by the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> which He endured from love and obedience, He delivered us as His members from our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as by the price of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>: in the same way as if a man by the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> industry of his hands were to redeem himself from a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed with his feet. For, just as the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> body is one though made up of diverse members, so the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">Christ's mystic body</a>, is reckoned as one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> with its head, which is Christ. Thirdly, by way of efficiency, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh, wherein He endured the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, is the instrument of the Godhead, so that His sufferings and actions operate with Divine power for expelling <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not suffer as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nevertheless His flesh is the instrument of the Godhead; and hence it is that His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> has a kind of Divine Power of casting out <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as was said above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> is corporeal, still it derives a kind of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> energy from the Godhead, to which the flesh is united as an instrument: and according to this power <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> delivered us from our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causally</a>--that is, by setting up the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our deliverance, from which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> whatsoever, past, present, or to come, could be forgiven: just as if a <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctor</a> were to prepare a medicine by which all sicknesses can be cured even in future.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As stated above, since <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> preceded, as a kind of universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, it needs to be applied to each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> for the cleansing of personal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Now this is done by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and penance and the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, which derive their power from <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, as shall be shown later (62, 5).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> is applied to us even through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that we may share in its fruits, according to <a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse25">Romans 3:25</a>: "Whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath proposed to be a propitiation, through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in His blood." But the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> through which we are cleansed from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not "lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>," which can <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> even with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> living" through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; that thus <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> may be applied to us, not only as to our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a>, but also as to our hearts. And even in this way <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven through the power of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion of Christ</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether we were delivered from the devil's power through Christ's Passion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that we were not delivered from the power of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> through <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>. For he has no power over others, who can do nothing to them without the sanction of another. But without the Divine permission the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> could never do hurt to any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as is evident in the instance of <a href="../cathen/08413a.htm">Job</a> (<a href="../bible/job001.htm">1,2</a>), where, by power received from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> first injured him in his possessions, and afterwards in his body. In like manner it is stated (<a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse31">Matthew 8:31-32</a>) that the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">devils</a> could not enter into the swine except with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> leave. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> never had power over men: and hence we are not delivered from his power through <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> exercises his power over men by <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempting</a> them and molesting their bodies. But even after the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> he continues to do the same to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Therefore we are not delivered from his power through <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the might of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> endures for ever, as, according to <a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse14">Hebrews 10:14</a>: "By one oblation He hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified." But deliverance rom the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> power is not found everywhere, since there are still idolaters in many regions of the world; nor will it endure for ever, because in the time of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> he will be especially active in using his power to the hurt of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; because it is said of him (<a href="../bible/2th002.htm#verse9">2 Thessalonians 2:9</a>): "Whose coming is according to the working of Satan, in all power, and signs, and lying wonders, and in all seduction of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>." Consequently it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> being delivered from the power of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse31">John 12:31</a>), when His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> was drawing nigh: "Now shall the prince of this world be cast out; and I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all things to Myself." Now He was lifted up from the earth by His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> on the cross. Therefore by His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> was deprived of his power over <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There are three things to be considered regarding the power which the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> exercised over men previous to <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>. The first is on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> own part, who by his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> deserved to be delivered over to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> power, and was overcome by his <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempting</a>. Another point is on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> part, whom <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had offended by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, and who with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> left <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> under the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> power. The third is on the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> part, who out of his most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> will hindered <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from securing his <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p>As to the first point, by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was delivered from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> power, in so far as the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). As to the second, it must be said that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> freed us from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> power, inasmuch as it reconciled us with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as shall be shown later (4). But as to the third, <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> delivered us from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, inasmuch as in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> he exceeded the limit of power assigned him by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by conspiring to bring about <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death, Who, being sinless, did not deserve to die. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiii, cap. xiv): "The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> was vanquished by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: because, while discovering in Him nothing deserving of death, nevertheless he slew Him. And it is certainly just that the debtors whom he held captive should be set at liberty since they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Him whom the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> slew, though He was no debtor."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is said to have had such power over <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> not as though he were able to injure them without <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sanction, but because he was <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> permitted to injure <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> whom by <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempting</a> he had induced to give <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> so permitting it, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> can still <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> men's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and harass their bodies: yet there is a remedy provided for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> through <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, whereby he can safeguard himself against the enemy's assaults, so as not to be dragged down into the destruction of everlasting death. And all who resisted the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> previous to the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> were enabled to do so through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, although it was not yet accomplished. Yet in one respect no one was able to escape the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> hands, i.e. so as not to descend into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. But after <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, men can defend themselves from this by its power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> permits the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> to deceive men by certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and in times and places, according to the hidden motive of His judgments; still, there is always a remedy provided through <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, for defending themselves against the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> snares of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, even in <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist's</a> time. But if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> neglect to make use of this remedy, it detracts nothing from the efficacy of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether men were freed from the punishment of sin through Christ's Passion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that men were not freed from the punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. For the chief punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal damnation</a>. But those damned in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> were not set free by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, because "in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> there is no redemption" [<a href="../cathen/11220a.htm">Office of the Dead</a>, Resp. vii]. It seems, therefore, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> did not deliver men from the punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no punishment should be imposed upon them who are delivered from the debt of punishment. But a satisfactory punishment is imposed upon penitents. Consequently, men were not freed from the debt of punishment by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, death is a punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse23">Romans 6:23</a>: "The wages of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is death." But men still die after <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>. Therefore it seems that we have not been delivered from the debt of punishment.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse4">Isaiah 53:4</a>): "Surely He hath borne our iniquities and carried our sorrows."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Through <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> we have been delivered from the debt of punishment in two ways. First of all, directly--namely, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> was sufficient and superabundant satisfaction for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>: but when sufficient satisfaction has been paid, then the debt of punishment is abolished. In another way--indirectly, that is to say--in so far as <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, upon which the debt of punishment rests.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> works its effect in them to whom it is applied, through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. And, consequently, the lost in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> cannot avail themselves of its effects, since they are not united to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in the aforesaid manner.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above (1, ad 4,5), in order to secure the effects of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, we must be likened unto Him. Now we are likened unto Him sacramentally in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse4">Romans 6:4</a>: "For we are buried together with Him by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> into death." Hence no punishment of satisfaction is imposed upon men at their <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, since they are fully delivered by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> satisfaction. But because, as it is written (<a href="../bible/1pe003.htm#verse18">1 Peter 3:18</a>), "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> died" but "once for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>," therefore a man cannot a second time be likened unto <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death by the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a>. Hence it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that those who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> be likened unto <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> suffering by some form of punishment or suffering which they endure in their own <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; yet, by the co-operation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> satisfaction, much lighter penalty suffices than one that is proportionate to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> satisfaction works its effect in us inasmuch as we are incorporated with Him, as the members with their head, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Now the members must be conformed to their head. Consequently, as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> first had <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with bodily passibility, and through the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> attained to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, so we likewise, who are His members, are freed by His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> from all debt of punishment, yet so that we first receive in our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> "the spirit of adoption of sons," whereby our names are written down for the inheritance of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, while we yet have a passible and mortal body: but afterwards, "being made conformable" to the sufferings and death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, we are brought into <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, according to the saying of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse17">Romans 8:17</a>): "And if sons, heirs also: heirs indeed of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and joint heirs with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; yet so if we suffer with Him, that we may be also glorified with Him."

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether we were reconciled to God through Christ's Passion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that we were not reconciled to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>. For there is no need of reconciliation between friends. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> always loved us, according to <a href="../bible/wis011.htm#verse25">Wisdom 11:25</a>: "Thou lovest all the things that are, and hatest none of the things which Thou hast made." Therefore <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> did not reconcile us to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the same thing cannot be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and effect: hence <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of meriting, does not come under <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> love is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse16">John 3:16</a>: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> so loved the world, as to give His only-begotten Son." It does not appear, then, that we were reconciled to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, so that He began to love us anew.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> was completed by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> slaying Him; and thereby they offended <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> grievously. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> is rather the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of wrath than of reconciliation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse10">Romans 5:10</a>): "We are reconciled to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the death of His Son."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> is in two ways the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our reconciliation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In the first way, inasmuch as it takes away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by which men became <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> enemies, according to <a href="../bible/wis014.htm#verse9">Wisdom 14:9</a>: "To <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> are hateful alike"; and <a href="../bible/psa005.htm#verse7">Psalm 5:7</a>: "Thou hatest all the workers of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>." In another way, inasmuch as it is a most acceptable sacrifice to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now it is the proper effect of sacrifice to appease <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: just as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> likewise overlooks an offense committed against him on account of some pleasing act of homage shown him. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/1sa026.htm#verse19">1 Samuel 26:19</a>): "If the Lord stir thee up against me, let Him accept of sacrifice." And in like fashion <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> suffering was such a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> act that, because of its being found in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was appeased for every offense of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> with regard to those who are made one with the crucified <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in the aforesaid manner (1, ad 4).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> loves all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> as to their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which He Himself made; yet He <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> them with respect to the crimes they commit against Him, according to <a href="../bible/sir012.htm#verse3">Sirach 12:3</a>: "The Highest hateth sinners."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not said to have reconciled us with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had begun anew to love us, since it is written (<a href="../bible/jer031.htm#verse3">Jeremiah 31:3</a>): "I have loved thee with an everlasting love"; but because the source of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> was taken away by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, both through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> being washed away and through compensation being made in the shape of a more pleasing offering.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As Christ's slayers were men, so also was the Christ slain. Now the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of the suffering <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> surpassed the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of His slayers. Accordingly <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> prevailed more in reconciling <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> than in provoking Him to wrath.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether Christ opened the gate of heaven to us by His Passion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not open the gate of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> to us by His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/pro011.htm#verse18">Proverbs 11:18</a>): "To him that soweth <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, there is a faithful reward." But the reward of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is the entering into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. It seems, therefore, that the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers who wrought works of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, obtained by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the entering into the heavenly kingdom even without <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>. Consequently <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the opening of the gate of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, Elias was caught up to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> previous to <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> (<a href="../bible/2ki002.htm">2 Kings 2</a>). But the effect never precedes the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Therefore it seems that the opening of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven's</a> gate is not the result of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as it is written (<a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse16">Matthew 3:16</a>), when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> the heavens were opened to Him. But His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> preceded the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. Consequently the opening of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is not the result of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/mic002.htm#verse13">Micah 2:13</a>): "For He shall go up that shall open the way before them." But to open the way to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> seems to be nothing else than to throw open its gate. Therefore it seems that the gate of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> was opened to us, not by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, but by His <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> is the saying of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse19">Hebrews 10:19</a>): "We have [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'having a'] confidence in the entering into the Holies"--that is, of the heavenly places--"through the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The shutting of the gate is the obstacle which hinders men from entering in. But it is on account of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that men were prevented from entering into the heavenly kingdom, since, according to <a href="../bible/isa035.htm#verse8">Isaiah 35:8</a>: "It shall be called the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> way, and the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> shall not pass over it." Now there is a twofold <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which prevents men from entering into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. The first is common to the whole race, for it is our first parents' <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and by that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven's</a> entrance is closed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Hence we read in <a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse24">Genesis 3:24</a> that after our first parents' <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "placed . . . cherubim and a flaming sword, turning every way, to keep the way of the tree of life." The other is the personal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of each one of us, committed by our personal act.

<p>Now by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> we have been delivered not only from the common <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, both as to its guilt and as to the debt of punishment, for which He paid the penalty on our behalf; but, furthermore, from the personal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, who share in His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Consequently, then the gate of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven's</a> kingdom is thrown open to us through <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>. This is precisely what the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse11">Hebrews 9:11-12</a>): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> being come a <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to come . . . by His own blood entered once into the Holies, having obtained <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> redemption." And this is foreshadowed (<a href="../bible/num035.htm#verse25">Numbers 35:25-28</a>), where it is said that the slayer* "shall abide there"--that is to say, in the city of refuge--"until the death of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a>, that is anointed with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> oil: but after he is dead, then shall he return home." [The <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> has 'slayer', the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>, 'innocent'--i.e. the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who has slain 'without <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> and enmity'.]

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers, by doing works of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> to enter into the heavenly kingdom, through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, according to <a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse33">Hebrews 11:33</a>: The <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> "by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> conquered kingdoms, wrought <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>," and each of them was thereby cleansed from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so far as the cleansing of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> is concerned. Nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and righteousness of no one of them sufficed for removing the barrier arising from the guilt of the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>: but this was removed at the cost of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> blood. Consequently, before <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> no one could enter the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> by obtaining everlasting beatitude, which consists in the full enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Elias was taken up into the atmospheric <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, but not in to the empyrean <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, which is the abode of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>: and likewise Enoch was translated into the <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">earthly paradise</a>, where he is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to live with Elias until the coming of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether by His Passion Christ merited to be exalted?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> to be exalted on account of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>.

But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, not on account of any preceding <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, but from the very union of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John 1:14</a>: "We saw His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> . . . as it were of the only-Begotten of the Father, full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." Therefore neither had He exaltation from the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> but from the union alone.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> for Himself from the first instant of His conception, as stated above (Question 34, Article 3). But His love was no greater during the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> than before. Therefore, since <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is the principle of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, it seems that He did not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> exaltation from the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> more than before.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the body comes from the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. ad Dioscor.). But by His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> Christ did not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> exaltation as to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, because His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was beatified from the first instant of His conception. Therefore neither did He <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> exaltation, as to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His body, from the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse8">Philippians 2:8</a>): "He became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross; for which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> also exalted Him."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Merit implies a certain equality of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse4">Romans 4:4</a>): "Now to him that worketh, the reward is reckoned according to debt." But when anyone by reason of his <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> will ascribes to himself something beyond his due, it is only just that he be deprived of something else which is his due; thus, "when a man steals a sheep he shall pay back four" (<a href="../bible/exo022.htm#verse1">Exodus 22:1</a>). And he is said to deserve it, inasmuch as his <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is chastised thereby. So likewise when any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> through his just will has stripped himself of what he ought to have, he deserves that something further be granted to him as the reward of his just will. And hence it is written (<a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse11">Luke 14:11</a>): "He that humbleth himself shall be exalted."

<p>Now in His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a> Himself beneath His dignity in four respects. In the first place as to His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> and death, to which He was not bound; secondly, as to the place, since His body was laid in a sepulchre and His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>; thirdly, as to the shame and mockeries He endured; fourthly, as to His being delivered up to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> power, as He Himself said to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> (<a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse11">John 19:11</a>): "Thou shouldst not have any power against Me, unless it were given thee from above." And, consequently, He <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> a four-fold exaltation from <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">His Passion</a>. First of all, as to His glorious <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>: hence it is written (<a href="../bible/psa138.htm#verse1">Psalm 138:1</a>): "Thou hast <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> my sitting down"--that is, the lowliness of My <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>--"and My rising up." Secondly, as to His <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascension into heaven</a>: hence it is written (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse9">Ephesians 4:9</a>): "Now that He <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended</a>, what is it, but because He also descended first into the lower parts of the earth? He that descended is the same also that <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended</a> above all the heavens." Thirdly, as to the sitting on the right hand of the Father and the showing forth of His Godhead, according to <a href="../bible/isa052.htm#verse13">Isaiah 52:13</a>: "He shall be exalted and extolled, and shall be exceeding high: as many have been astonished at him, so shall His visage be inglorious among men." Moreover (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse8">Philippians 2:8</a>) it is written: "He <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a> Himself, becoming obedient unto death, even to the death of the cross: for which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> also <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath exalted Him, and hath given Him a name which is above all names"--that is to say, so that He shall be hailed as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by all; and all shall pay Him homage as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And this is expressed in what follows: "That in the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name of Jesus</a> every knee should bow, of those that are in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, on earth, and under the earth." Fourthly, as to His judiciary power: for it is written (<a href="../bible/job036.htm#verse17">Job 36:17</a>): "Thy <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> hath been judged as that of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and judgment Thou shalt recover."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The source of meriting comes of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, while the body is the instrument of the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> work. And consequently the perfection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which was the source of meriting, ought not to be acquired in Him by <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, like the perfection of the body, which was the subject of suffering, and was thereby the instrument of His <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by His previous <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> did <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> exaltation on behalf of His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, whose will was animated with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; but in the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> He <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> His exaltation by way of recompense even on behalf of His body: since it is only just that the body, which from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> was subjected to the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, should receive recompense in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It was owing to a special dispensation in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> that before the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> did not shine out in His body, in order that He might procure His bodily <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> with greater <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, when He had <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> it by His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. But it was not beseeming for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be postponed, since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was united immediately with the Word; hence it was beseeming that its <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> should be filled by the Word Himself. But the body was united with the Word through the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.
