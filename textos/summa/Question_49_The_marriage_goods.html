<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether certain blessings are necessary in order to excuse marriage?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that certain blessings are not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in order to excuse marriage. For just as the preservation of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> which is effected by the nutritive power is intended by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, so too is the preservation of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> which is effected by marriage; and indeed so much the more as the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is better and more exalted than the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. But no goods are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to excuse the act of the nutritive power. Neither therefore are they <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to excuse marriage.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. viii, 12) the friendship between husband and wife is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, and includes the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, the useful, and the pleasant. But that which is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> in itself needs no excuse. Therefore neither should any goods be assigned for the excuse of <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> was instituted as a remedy and as an office, as stated above (Question 42, Article 2). Now it needs no excuse in so far as it is instituted as an office, since then it would also have needed an excuse in paradise, which is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, for there, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says, "marriage would have been without reproach and the marriage-bed without stain" (Gen. ad lit. ix). In like manner neither does it need an excuse in so far as it is intended as a remedy, any more than the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which were instituted as remedies for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> does not need these excuses.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are directed to whatever can be done aright. If then marriage can be righted by certain goods, it needs nothing else to right it besides the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and consequently there is no need to assign to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> any goods whereby it is righted, any more than to other things in which the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> direct us.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Wherever there is <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>, there must needs be some reason for excuse. Now marriage is allowed in the state of infirmity "by <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>" (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse6">1 Corinthians 7:6</a>). Therefore it needs to be excused by certain goods.

<p>Further, the intercourse of fornication and that of marriage are of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> as regards the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But the intercourse of fornication is wrong in itself. Therefore, in order that the marriage intercourse be not wrong, something must be added to it to make it right, and draw it to another moral <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> No wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should allow himself to lose a thing except for some compensation in the shape of an equal or better <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Wherefore for a thing that has a loss attached to it to be eligible, it needs to have some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> connected with it, which by compensating for that loss makes that thing ordinate and right. Now there is a loss of reason incidental to the union of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, both because the reason is carried away entirely on account of the vehemence of the pleasure, so that it is unable to understand anything at the same time, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 11); and again because of the tribulation of the flesh which such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> have to suffer from solicitude for temporal things (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse28">1 Corinthians 7:28</a>). Consequently the choice of this union cannot be made ordinate except by certain compensations whereby that same union is righted. and these are the goods which excuse marriage and make it right.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In the act of eating there is not such an intense pleasure overpowering the reason as in the aforesaid action, both because the generative power, whereby <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is transmitted, is infected and corrupt, whereas the nutritive power, by which <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is not transmitted, is neither corrupt nor infected; and again because each one feels in himself a defect of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> more than a defect of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Hence, in order to entice a man to take food which supplies a defect of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, it is enough that he feel this defect; but in order to entice him to the act whereby a defect of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is remedied, <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a> attached pleasure to that act, which moves even irrational animals in which there is not the stain of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. Hence the comparison fails.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> These goods which justify marriage belong to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of marriage, which consequently needs them, not as extrinsic <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of its rectitude, but as <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> in it that rectitude which belongs to it by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> From the very fact that marriage is intended as an office or as a remedy it has the aspect of something useful and right; nevertheless both aspects belong to it from the fact that it has these goods by which it fulfills the office and affords a remedy to <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> An act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> may derive its rectitude both from the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> as its elicitive principle, and from its circumstances as its formal principles; and the goods of marriage are related to marriage as circumstances to an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which owes it to those circumstances that it can be an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the goods of marriage are sufficiently enumerated?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the goods of marriage are insufficiently enumerated by the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> (Sent. iv, D, 31), namely "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, offspring, and sacrament." For the object of marriage among men is not only the begetting and feeding of children, but also the partnership of a common life, whereby each one contributes his share of work to the common stock, as stated in Ethic. viii, 12. Therefore as the offspring is reckoned a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>, so also should the communication of works.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the union of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, signified by <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>, is the effect of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> rather than <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> should be reckoned among the goods of <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>, just as it is required that neither party have intercourse with another, so is it required that the one pay the marriage debt to the other. Now the former pertains to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> according to the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> (Sent. iv, D, 31). Therefore <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> should also be reckoned among the goods of marriage on account of the payment of the debt.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, in <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> as signifying the union of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, just as indivisibility is required, so also is unity, whereby one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has one wife. But the sacrament which is reckoned among the three marriage goods pertains to indivisibility. Therefore there should be something else pertaining to unity.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> On the other hand, it would seem that they are too many. For one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> suffices to make one act right. Now <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore it was not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to add two other goods to make marriage right.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, the same <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> does not make a thing both useful and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, since the useful and the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> are opposite divisions of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now marriage derives its character of useful from the offspring. Therefore the offspring should not be reckoned among the goods that make marriage <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 7.</strong> Further, nothing should be reckoned as a property or <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of itself. Now these goods are reckoned to be <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of marriage. Therefore since <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, the sacrament should not be reckoned a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Matrimony is instituted both as an office of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. As an office of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> it is directed by two things, like every other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> act. one of these is required on the part of the agent and is the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the due end, and thus the "offspring" is accounted a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>; the other is required on the part of the act, which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> generically through being about a due <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; and thus we have "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>," whereby a man has intercourse with his wife and with no other <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. Besides this it has a certain <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, and this is signified by the very word "sacrament."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Offspring signifies not only the begetting of children, but also their <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, to which as its end is directed the entire communion of works that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> between <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and wife as united in marriage, since parents <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> "lay up" for their "children" (<a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse14">2 Corinthians 12:14</a>); so that the offspring like a principal end includes another, as it were, secondary end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> is not taken here as a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but as part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, in so far as <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> [fides] signifies the suiting of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> to word [fiant dicta] by keeping one's promises; for since marriage is a contract it contains a promise whereby this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is assigned to this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Just as the marriage promise means that neither party is to have intercourse with a third party, so does it require that they should mutually pay the marriage debt. The latter is indeed the chief of the two, since it follows from the power which each receives over the other. Consequently both these things pertain to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, although the Boo of Sentences mentions that which is the less manifest.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> By sacrament we are to understand not only indivisibility, but all those things that result from marriage being a sign of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> union with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. We may also reply that the unity to which the objection refers pertains to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, just as indivisibility belongs to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> here does not denote a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but that <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which is a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and is called by the name of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> Just as the right use of a useful <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> derives its rectitude not from the useful but from the reason which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the right use, so too direction to a useful <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> may <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of rectitude by virtue of the reason <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> the right direction; and in this way marriage, through being directed to the offspring, is useful, and nevertheless righteous, inasmuch as it is directed aright.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 7.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> says (Sent. iv, D, 31), sacrament here does not mean <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> itself, but its indissolubility, which is a sign of the same thing as <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> is.

<p>We may also reply that although marriage is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, marriage as marriage is not the same as marriage as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, since it was instituted not only as a sign of a sacred thing, but also as an office of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence the sacramental aspect is a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> added to marriage considered in itself, whence also it derives its rectitude. Hence its sacramentality, if I may use the term, is reckoned among the goods which justify marriage; and accordingly this third <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of marriage, the sacrament to wit, denotes not only its indissolubility, but also whatever pertains to its signification.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the sacrament is the chief of the marriage goods?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the "sacrament" is not the chief of the marriage goods. For the end is principal in everything. Now the end of marriage is the offspring. Therefore the offspring is the chief marriage <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in the specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> the difference is more important than the genus, even as the form is more important than <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in the composition of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> thing. Now "sacrament" refers to marriage on the part of its genus, while "offspring" and "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>" refer thereto on the part of the difference whereby it is a special kind of sacrament. Therefore these other two are more important than sacrament in reference to marriage.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as we find marriage without "offspring" and without "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>," so do we find it without indissolubility, as in the case where one of the parties enters religion before the marriage is consummated. Therefore neither from this point of view is "sacrament" the most important marriage <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, an effect cannot be more important than its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Now consent, which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>, is often changed. Therefore the marriage also can be dissolved and consequently inseparability is not always a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of marriage.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which produce an everlasting effect imprint a character. But no character is imprinted in <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>. Therefore it is not conditioned by a lasting inseparability. Consequently just as there is marriage without "offspring" so is there marriage without "sacrament," and thus the same conclusion follows as above.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> That which has a place in the definition of a thing is most <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> thereto. Now inseparability, which pertains to sacrament, is placed in the definition of marriage (44, 3), while offspring and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are not. Therefore among the other goods sacrament is the most <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>.

<p>Further, the Divine power which works in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> is more efficacious than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> power. But "offspring" and "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>" pertain to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> as directed to an office of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, whereas "sacrament" pertains to it as instituted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore sacrament takes a more important part in marriage than the other two.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> This or that may be more important to a thing in two ways, either because it is more <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> or because it is more excellent. If the reason is because it is more excellent, then "sacrament" is in every way the most important of the three marriage goods, since it belongs to marriage considered as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; while the other two belong to it as an office of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and a perfection of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is more excellent than a perfection of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. If, however, it is said to be more important because it is more <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a>, we must draw a distinction; for "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>" and "offspring" can be considered in two ways. First, in themselves, and thus they regard the use of <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> in begetting children and observing the marriage compact; while inseparability, which is denoted by "sacrament," regards the very sacrament considered in itself, since from the very fact that by the marriage compact <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and wife give to one another power the one over the other in perpetuity, it follows that they cannot be put asunder. Hence there is no <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> without inseparability, whereas there is <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> without "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>" and "offspring," because the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of a thing does not depend on its use; and in this sense "sacrament" is more <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> than "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>" and "offspring." Secondly, "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>" and "offspring" may be considered as in their principles, so that "offspring" denote the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of having children, and "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>" the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of remaining faithful, and there can be no <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> without these also, since they are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> by the marriage compact itself, so that if anything contrary to these were expressed in the consent which makes a marriage, the marriage would be invalid. Taking "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>" and "offspring" in this sense, it is clear that "offspring" is the most <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> thing in marriage, secondly "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>," and thirdly "sacrament"; even as to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> it is more <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to be in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> than to be in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, although it is more excellent to be in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The end as regards the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> stands first in a thing, but as regards the attainment it stands last. It is the same with "offspring" among the marriage goods; wherefore in a way it is the most important and in another way it is not.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Sacrament, even as holding the third place among the marriage goods, belongs to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> by reason of its difference; for it is called "sacrament" from its signification of that particular sacred thing which <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> signifies.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Bono Conjug. ix), marriage is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of mortals, wherefore in the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> "they shall neither marry nor be <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a>" (<a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse30">Matthew 22:30</a>). Hence the marriage bond does not last after the life wherein it is contracted, and consequently it is said to be inseparable, because it cannot be sundered in this life, but either by bodily death after carnal union, or by <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> death after a merely <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> union.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Although the consent which makes a marriage is not everlasting materially, i.e. in regard to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the act, since that act ceases and a contrary act may succeed it, nevertheless formally speaking it is everlasting, because it is a consent to an ever lasting bond, else it would not make a marriage, for a consent to take a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> for a time makes no marriage. Hence it is everlasting formally, inasmuch as an act takes its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from its object; and thus it is that <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> derives its inseparability from the consent.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> In those <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> wherein a character is imprinted, power is given to perform <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> actions; but in <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>, to perform bodily actions. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> by reason of the power which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and wife receive over one another agrees with the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> in which a character is imprinted, and from this it derives its inseparability, as the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> says (Sent. iv, D, 31); yet it differs from them in so far as that power regards bodily acts; hence it does not confer a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> character.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the marriage act is excused by the aforesaid goods?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the marriage act cannot be altogether excused from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by the aforesaid goods. For whoever allows himself to lose a greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for the sake of a lesser <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> because he allows it inordinately. Now the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of reason which is prejudiced in the marriage act is greater than these three marriage goods. Therefore the aforesaid goods do not suffice to excuse marriage intercourse.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if a moral <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> be added to a moral <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> the sum total is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since one <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> circumstance makes an action <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, whereas one <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> circumstance does not make it <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now the marriage act is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in itself, else it would need no excuse. Therefore the addition of the marriage goods cannot make the act <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, wherever there is immoderate passion there is moral <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. Now the marriage goods cannot prevent the pleasure in that act from being immoderate. Therefore they cannot excuse it from being a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. ii, 15), shame is only <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by a disgraceful <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>. Now the marriage goods do not deprive that <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> of its shame. Therefore they cannot excuse it from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The marriage act differs not from fornication except by the marriage goods. If therefore these were not sufficient to excuse it marriage would be always unlawful; and this is contrary to what was stated above (Question 41, Article 3).

<p>Further, the marriage goods are related to its act as its due circumstances, as stated above (1, ad 4). Now the like circumstances are sufficient to prevent an action from being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore these goods can excuse marriage so that it is nowise a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> An act is said to be excused in two ways. First, on the part of the agent, so that although it be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> it is not imputed as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to the agent, or at least not as so grave a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. thus <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is said to excuse a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> wholly or partly. Secondly, an act is said to be excused on its part, so that, namely, it is not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; and it is thus that the aforesaid goods are said to excuse the marriage act. Now it is from the same <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that an act is not morally <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and that it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since there is no such thing as an indifferent act, as was stated in the Second Book (Sent. ii, D, 40; I-II, 18, 9). Now a <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a> is said to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in two ways. In one way by <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and thus an act derives its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> from those things which place it in the mean. This is what "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>" and "offspring" do in the marriage act, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). In another way, by <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the "sacrament," in which way an act is said to be not only <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but also <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and the marriage act derives this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> from the indissolubility of the union, in respect of which it signifies the union of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Thus it is clear that the aforesaid goods sufficiently excuse the marriage act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> By the marriage act <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not incur harm to his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> as to <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, but only as to act. Nor is it unfitting that a certain act which is generically better be sometimes interrupted for some less <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> act; for it is possible to do this without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as in the case of one who ceases from the act of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> in order meanwhile to devote himself to action.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument would avail if the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that is inseparable from carnal intercourse were an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But in this case it is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> not of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> but of punishment alone, consisting in the rebellion of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> against reason; and consequently the conclusion does not follow.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The excess of passion that amounts to a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not refer to the passion's <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantitative</a> intensity, but to its proportion to reason; wherefore it is only when a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> goes beyond the bounds of reason that it is reckoned to be immoderate. Now the pleasure attaching to the marriage act, while it is most intense in point of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, does not go beyond the bounds previously appointed by reason before the commencement of the act, although reason is unable to regulate them during the pleasure itself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The turpitude that always accompanies the marriage act and always <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> shame is the turpitude of punishment, not of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> ashamed of any defect.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the marriage act can be excused without the marriage goods?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the marriage act can be excused even without the marriage goods. For he who is moved by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> alone to the marriage act, apparently does not intend any of the marriage goods, since the marriage goods pertain to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> or <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Yet when a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is moved to the aforesaid act by the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> alone, seemingly he commits no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for nothing <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, since "<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and order," as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv). Therefore the marriage act can be excused even without the marriage goods.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, he who has intercourse with his wife in order to avoid fornication, does not seemingly intend any of the marriage goods. Yet he does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> apparently, because marriage was granted to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness for the very purpose of avoiding fornication (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse2">1 Corinthians 7:2-6</a>). Therefore the marriage act can be excused even without the marriage goods.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, he who uses as he will that which is his own does not act against <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and thus seemingly does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now marriage makes the wife the husband's own, and "vice versa." Therefore, if they use one another at will through the instigation of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, it would seem that it is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and thus the same conclusion follows.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> generically does not become <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> unless it be done with an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>. Now the marriage act whereby a husband <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> his wife is generically <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore it cannot be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> unless it be done with an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>. Now it can be done with a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, even without intending any marriage <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, for instance by intending to keep or acquire bodily health. Therefore it seems that this act can be excused even without the marriage goods.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> If the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> be removed the effect is removed. Now the marriage goods are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of rectitude in the marriage act. Therefore the marriage act cannot be excused without them.

<p>Further, the aforesaid act does not differ from the act of fornication except in the aforesaid goods. But the act of fornication is always <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore the marriage act also will always be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> unless it be excused by the aforesaid goods.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Just as the marriage goods, in so far as they consist in a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, make a marriage honest and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, so too, in so far as they are in the actual <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, they make the marriage act honest, as regards those two marriage goods which relate to the marriage act. Hence when <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> come together for the purpose of begetting children, or of paying the debt to one another (which pertains to "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>") they are wholly excused from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But the third <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> does not relate to the use of marriage, but to its excuse, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>); wherefore it makes marriage itself honest, but not its act, as though its act were wholly excused from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, through being done on account of some signification. Consequently there are only two ways in which <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> can come together without any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> at all, namely in order to have offspring, and in order to pay the debt. otherwise it is always at least a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The offspring considered as a marriage <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> includes something besides the offspring as a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> intended by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> intends offspring as safeguarding the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, whereas the offspring as a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the sacrament of marriage includes besides this the directing of the child to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which intends the offspring must needs be referred either actually or <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of having an offspring, as a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the sacrament: otherwise the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> would go no further than a creature; and this is always a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Consequently whenever <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> alone moves a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to the marriage act, he is not wholly excused from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, except in so far as the movement of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is further directed actually or <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a> to the offspring as a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Nor does it follow that the instigation of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but that it is imperfect unless it be further directed to some marriage <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> If a man intends by the marriage act to prevent fornication in his wife, it is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because this is a kind of payment of the debt that comes under the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>." But if he intends to avoid fornication in himself, then there is a certain superfluity, and accordingly there is a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, nor was the sacrament instituted for that purpose, except by <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>, which regards venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> One due circumstance does not suffice to make a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> act, and consequently it does not follow that, no matter how one use one's own property, the use is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but when one uses it as one ought according to all the circumstances.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Although it is not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in itself to intend to keep oneself in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> health, this <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> becomes <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, if one intend health by means of something that is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> ordained for that purpose; for instance if one sought only bodily health by the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and the same applies to the marriage act in the question at issue.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether it is a mortal sin for a man to have knowledge of his wife, with the intention not of a marriage good but merely of pleasure?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that whenever a man has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of his wife, with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> not of a marriage <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> but merely of pleasure, he commits a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For according to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> (Comment. in <a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse25">Ephesians 5:25</a>), as quoted in the text (Sent. iv, D, 31), "the pleasure taken in the embraces of a wanton is damnable in a husband." Now nothing but mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is said to be damnable. Therefore it is always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of one's wife for mere pleasure.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, consent to pleasure is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated in the Second Book (Sent. ii, D, 24). Now whoever <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> his wife for the sake of pleasure consents to the pleasure. Therefore he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whoever fails to refer the use of a creature to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> enjoys a creature, and this is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But whoever uses his wife for mere pleasure does not refer that use to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, no one should be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> except for a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now according to the text (Sent. ii, D, 24) a man who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> his wife for mere pleasure is debarred from entering the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as though he were <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a>. Therefore every such <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> As stated in the text (Sent. ii, D, 24), according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Contra Jul. ii, 10; De Decem Chord. xi; Serm. xli, de Sanct.), carnal intercourse of this kind is one of the daily <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, for which we say the "Our Father." Now these are not mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore, etc.

<p>Further, it is no mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to take food for mere pleasure. Therefore in like manner it is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for a man to use his wife merely to satisfy his desire.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some say that whenever pleasure is the chief motive for the marriage act it is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; that when it is an indirect motive it is a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and that when it spurns the pleasure altogether and is displeasing, it is wholly void of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; so that it would be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to seek pleasure in this act, a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to take the pleasure when offered, but that perfection requires one to detest it. But this is impossible, since according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. x, 3,4) the same judgment applies to pleasure as to action, because pleasure in a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> action is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and in an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> action, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; wherefore, as the marriage act is not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in itself, neither will it be always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to seek pleasure therein. Consequently the right answer to this question is that if pleasure be sought in such a way as to exclude the honesty of marriage, so that, to wit, it is not as a wife but as a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that a man treats his wife, and that he is ready to use her in the same way if she were not his wife, it is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; wherefore such a man is said to be too ardent a lover of his wife, because his ardor carries him away from the goods of marriage. If, however, he seek pleasure within the bounds of marriage, so that it would not be sought in another than his wife, it is a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> seeks wanton pleasure in his wife when he sees no more in her that he would in a wanton.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Consent to the pleasure of the intercourse that is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is itself a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but such is not the consent to the marriage act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although he does not actually refer the pleasure to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he does not place his will's last end therein; otherwise he would seek it anywhere indifferently. Hence it does not follow that he enjoys a creature; but he uses a creature actually for his own sake, and himself <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a>, though not actually, for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The reason for this statement is not that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> deserves to be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> for this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but because he renders himself unfit for <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, since in that act, he becomes flesh and nothing more.
