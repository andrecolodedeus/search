<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether human nature was more assumable by the Son of God than any other nature?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not more capable of being assumed by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> than any other <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. ad Volusianum cxxxvii): "In <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> wrought <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> the whole reason of the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> is the power of the doer." Now the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who wrought <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, which is a most <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> work, is not limited to one <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, since the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not more capable of being assumed than any other creature.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, likeness is the foundation of the fittingness of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> of the Divine Person, as above stated (3, 8). But as in rational creatures we find the likeness of image, so in irrational creatures we find the image of trace. Therefore the irrational creature was as capable of assumption as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> we find a more perfect likeness than in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says: (Hom. de Cent. Ovib.; xxxiv in Ev.), where he introduces <a href="../bible/eze028.htm#verse12">Ezekiel 28:12</a>: "Thou wast the seal of resemblance." And <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is found in <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, even as in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, according to <a href="../bible/job004.htm#verse18">Job 4:18</a>: "And in His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> He found <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was as capable of assumption as the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, since the highest perfection belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the more like to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> a thing is, the more perfect it is. But the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is more perfect than its parts, amongst which is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is more capable of being assumed than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse31">Proverbs 8:31</a>) by the mouth of Begotten Wisdom: "My delights were to be with the children of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>"; and hence there would seem some fitness in the union of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing is said to be assumable as being capable of being assumed by a Divine Person, and this capability cannot be taken with reference to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> passive power, which does not extend to what transcends the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order, as the personal union of a creature with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> transcends it. Hence it follows that a thing is said to be assumable according to some fitness for such a union. Now this fitness in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> may be taken from two things, viz. according to its dignity, and according to its need. According to its dignity, because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as being rational and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, was made for attaining to the Word to some extent by its operation, viz. by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> Him. According to its need--because it stood in need of restoration, having fallen under <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. Now these two things belong to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> alone. For in the irrational creature the fitness of dignity is wanting, and in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> the aforesaid fitness of need is wanting. Hence it follows that only <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was assumable.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Creatures are said to be "such" with reference to their proper <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, not with reference to what belongs to them from their first and universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>; thus we call a disease incurable, not that it cannot be cured by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but that it cannot be cured by the proper principles of the subject. Therefore a creature is said to be not assumable, not as if we withdrew anything from the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but in order to show the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the creature, which has no capability for this.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The likeness of image is found in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, forasmuch as it is capable of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, viz. by attaining to Him through its own operation of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and love. But the likeness of trace regards only a representation by Divine impression, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the creature, and does not imply that the irrational creature, in which such a likeness is, can attain to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by its own operation alone. For what does not come up to the less, has no fitness for the greater; as a body which is not fitted to be perfected by a sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is much less fitted for an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Now much greater and more perfect is the union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in personal being than the union by operation. And hence the irrational creature which falls short of the union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by operation has no fitness to be united with Him in personal being.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Some say that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are not assumable, since they are perfect in their personality from the beginning of their creation, inasmuch as they are not subject to generation and corruption; hence they cannot be assumed to the unity of a Divine Person, unless their personality be destroyed, and this does not befit the incorruptibility of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> nor the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the one assuming, to Whom it does not belong to corrupt any perfection in the creature assumed. But this would not seem totally to disprove the fitness of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> for being assumed. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by producing a new <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> could join it to Himself in unity of Person, and in this way nothing pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> would be corrupted in it. But as was said above, there is wanting the fitness of need, because, although the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in some is the subject of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is irremediable, as stated above (I, 64, 2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The perfection of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is not the perfection of one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> or suppositum, but of something which is one by position or order, whereof very many parts are not capable of assumption, as was said above. Hence it follows that only <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is capable of being assumed.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the Son of God assumed a person?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> assumed a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 11) that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> "assumed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> 'in atomo,'" i.e. in an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. But an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> in rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, as is plain from <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> (De Duab. Nat.). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> assumed a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 6) that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> "assumed what He had sown in our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." But He sowed our personality there. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> assumed a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, nothing is absorbed unless it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> [Paschas. Diac., De Spiritu Sanct. ii] says in a <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a> that "the Person of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> absorbed the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." Therefore it would seem that the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> previous to its being assumed.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [Fulgentius] says (De Fide ad Petrum ii) that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> assumed the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, not the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing is said to be assumed inasmuch as it is taken into another. Hence, what is assumed must be presupposed to the assumption, as what is moved locally is presupposed to the motion. Now a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not presupposed to assumption; rather, it is the term of the assumption, as was said (3, 1,2). For if it were presupposed, it must either have been corrupted--in which case it was useless; or it remains after the union--and thus there would be two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, one assuming and the other assumed, which is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, as was shown above (Question 2, Article 6). Hence it follows that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> nowise assumed a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> assumed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> "in atomo," i.e. in an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, which is no other than the uncreated suppositum, the Person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Hence it does not follow that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> was assumed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Its proper personality is not wanting to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> assumed through the loss of anything pertaining to the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> but through the addition of something which is above <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, viz. the union with a Divine Person.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Absorption does not here imply the destruction of anything pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a>, but the hindering what might otherwise have been. For if the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> had not been assumed by a Divine Person, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> would have had its own personality; and in this way is it said, although improperly, that the Person "absorbed the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>," inasmuch as the Divine Person by His union hindered the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> from having its personality.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the Divine Person assumed a man?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the Divine Person assumed a man. For it is written (<a href="../bible/psa064.htm#verse5">Psalm 64:5</a>): "Blessed is he whom Thou hast chosen and taken to Thee," which a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> expounds of Christ; and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Agone Christ. xi): "The <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> assumed a man, and in him bore things <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the word "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" signifies a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> assumed a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore He assumed a man.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is a man. But He is not one of the men He did not assume, for with equal reason He would be Peter or any other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore He is the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whom He assumed.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Is the authority of Felix, Pope and Martyr, which is quoted by the Council of Ephesus: "We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, born of the Virgin Mary, because He is the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">Eternal</a> Son and <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, and not a man assumed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in such sort that there is another besides Him. For the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> did not assume a man, so that there be another besides Him."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As has been said above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), what is assumed is not the term of the assumption, but is presupposed to the assumption. Now it was said (3, 1,2) that the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> to Whom the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is assumed is none other than the Divine Person, Who is the term of the assumption. Now this word "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" signifies <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as it is in a suppositum, because, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 4,11), this word <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> signifies Him Who has <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. And hence it cannot properly be said that the Son assumed a man, granted (as it must be, in fact) that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there is but one suppositum and one hypostasis. But according to such as hold that there are two hypostases or two supposita in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, it may fittingly and properly be said that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> assumed a man. Hence the first opinion quoted in Sent. iii, D. 6, grants that a man was assumed. But this opinion is <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>, as was said above (Question 2, Article 6).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> These phrases are not to be taken too literally, but are to be loyally explained, wherever they are used by <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>; so as to say that a man was assumed, inasmuch as his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was assumed; and because the assumption terminated in this--that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The word "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" signifies <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in the concrete, inasmuch as it is in a suppositum; and hence, since we cannot say a suppositum was assumed, so we cannot say a man was assumed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whom He assumed, but the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whose <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> He assumed.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the Son of God ought to have assumed human nature abstracted from all individuals?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> ought to have assumed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> abstracted from all <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>. For the assumption of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> took place for the common <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; hence it is said of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse10">1 Timothy 4:10</a>) that He is "the Saviour of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, especially of the faithful." But <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as it is in <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> withdraws from its universality. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> ought to have assumed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as it is abstracted from all <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, what is noblest in all things ought to be attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But in every genus what is of itself is best. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> ought to have assumed self-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> [per se] <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, which, according to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a>, is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> abstracted from its <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> ought to have assumed this.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was not assumed by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> in the concrete as is signified by the word "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," as was said above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). Now in this way it signifies <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as it is in <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, as is plain from what has been said (3). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> assumed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as it is separated from <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 11): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Word Incarnate did not assume a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in pure thought; for this would have been no <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, but a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> and fictitious <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>." But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as it is separated or abstracted from <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> is "taken to be a pure conception, since it does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in itself," as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 11). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> did not assume <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as it is separated from <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> or of any other sensible thing, beyond the being which it has in <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, may be taken in two ways: first, as if it had being of itself, away from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a> held; secondly, as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> either <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> or Divine. Now it cannot subsist of itself, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proves (Metaph. vii, 26,27,29,51), because sensible <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> belongs to the specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of sensible things, and is placed in its definition, as flesh and bones in the definition of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> cannot be without sensible <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Nevertheless, if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> were subsistent in this way, it would not be fitting that it should be assumed by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>. First, because this assumption is terminated in a Person, and it is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a common form to be thus individualized in a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Secondly, because to a common <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> can only be attributed common and universal operations, according to which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> neither <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> nor demerits, whereas, on the contrary, the assumption took place in order that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, having assumed our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, might <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> for us. Thirdly, because a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> so <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> would not be sensible, but intelligible. But the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> assumed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in order to show Himself in men's sight, according to <a href="../bible/bar003.htm#verse38">Baruch 3:38</a>: "Afterwards He was seen upon earth, and conversed with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>."

<p>Likewise, neither could <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> have been assumed by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, as it is in the Divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, since it would be none other than the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>; and, according to this, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> would be in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. Neither can we say that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> assumed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as it is in a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, for this would mean nothing else but that He is understood to assume a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and thus if He did not assume it in reality, this would be a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> understanding; nor would this assumption of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> be anything but a fictitious <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 11).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a> <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is the common Saviour of all, not by a generic or specific community, such as is attributed to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> separated from the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, but by a community of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, whereby the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a> <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is the universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Self-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> [per se] <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not to be found in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in such a way as to be outside the singular, as the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a> held, although some say <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that the separate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was only in the Divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. And hence it was not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for it to be assumed by the Word, since it had been with Him from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was not assumed in the concrete, as if the suppositum were presupposed to the assumption, nevertheless it is assumed in an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, since it is assumed so as to be in an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the Son of God ought to have assumed human nature in all individuals?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> ought to have assumed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in all <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>. For what is assumed first and by itself is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But what belongs <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> to a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> belongs to all who <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore it was fitting that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> should be assumed by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> in all its supposita.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the Divine <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> proceeded from Divine Love; hence it is written (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse16">John 3:16</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> so loved the world as to give His only-begotten Son." But love makes us give ourselves to our friends as much as we can, and it was possible for the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> to assume several <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, as was said above (Question 3, Article 7), and with equal reason all. Hence it was fitting for the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> to assume <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in all its supposita.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a skilful workman completes his work in the shortest manner possible. But it would have been a shorter way if all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> had been assumed to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> sonship than for one <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> Son to lead many to the adoption of sons, as is written <a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse5">Galatians 4:5</a> (cf. <a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse10">Hebrews 2:10</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> ought to have been assumed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in all its supposita.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 11) that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> "did not assume <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, nor did He assume all its hypostases."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It was unfitting for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to be assumed by the Word in all its supposita. First, because the multitude of supposita of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to it, would have been taken away. For since we must not see any other suppositum in the assumed <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, except the Person assuming, as was said above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), if there was no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> except what was assumed, it would follow that there was but one suppositum of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which is the Person assuming. Secondly, because this would have been derogatory to the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a> <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, as He is the First-born of many brethren, according to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, even as He is the First-born of all creatures according to the Divine, for then all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> would be of equal dignity. Thirdly, because it is fitting that as one Divine suppositum is <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>, so He should assume one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, so that on both sides unity might be found.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> To be assumed belongs to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of itself, because it does not belong to it by reason of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, as it belongs to the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> to assume by reason of the Person; not, however, that it belongs to it of itself as if belonging to its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> principles, or as its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> property in which manner it would belong to all its supposita.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> is shown not merely in the assumption of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but especially in what He suffered in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> for other men, according to <a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse8">Romans 5:8</a>: "But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> commendeth His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> towards us; because when as yet we were sinners . . . <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> died for us," which would not have taken place had He assumed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in all its supposita.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In order to shorten the way, which every skilful workman does, what can be done by one must not be done by many. Hence it was most fitting that by one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> all the rest should be saved.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether it was fitting for the Son of God to assume human nature of the stock of Adam?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it was not fitting for the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> to assume <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the stock of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb007.htm#verse26">Hebrews 7:26</a>): "For it was fitting that we should have such a <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> . . . separated from sinners." But He would have been still further separated from sinners had He not assumed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the stock of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, a sinner. Hence it seems that He ought not to have assumed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the stock of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in every genus the principle is nobler than what is from the principle. Hence, if He wished to assume <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, He ought to have assumed it in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> himself.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> were greater sinners than the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says on <a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse15">Galatians 2:15</a>: "For we by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> are <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, and not of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, sinners." Hence, if He wished to assume <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> from sinners, He ought rather to have assumed it from the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> than from the stock of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, who was just.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> (<a href="../bible/luk003.htm">Luke 3</a>), the <a href="../cathen/06410a.htm">genealogy of our Lord</a> is traced back to <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiii, 18): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was able to assume <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> elsewhere than from the stock of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, who by his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> had fettered the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>; yet <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> judged it better to assume <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> from the vanquished race, and thus to vanquish the enemy of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>." And this for three reasons: First, because it would seem to belong to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> that he who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> should make amends; and hence that from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which he had corrupted should be assumed that whereby satisfaction was to be made for the whole <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Secondly, it pertains to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> greater dignity that the conqueror of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> should spring from the stock conquered by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Thirdly, because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> power is thereby made more manifest, since, from a corrupt and weakened <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, He assumed that which was raised to such might and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> ought to be separated from sinners as regards <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which He came to overthrow, and not as regards <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which He came to save, and in which "it behooved Him in all things to be made like to His brethren," as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse17">Hebrews 2:17</a>). And in this is His innocence the more wonderful, seeing that though assumed from a mass tainted by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was endowed with such purity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As was said above (ad 1) it behooved Him Who came to take away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to be separated from sinners as regards <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, to which <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was subject, whom <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> "brought out of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>," as is written (<a href="../bible/wis010.htm#verse2">Wisdom 10:2</a>). For it behooved Him Who came to cleanse all, not to need cleansing Himself; just as in every genus of motion the first mover is immovable as regards that motion, and the first to alter is itself unalterable. Hence it was not fitting that He should assume <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> himself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> ought especially to be separated from sinners as regards <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and to possess the highest innocence, it was fitting that between the first sinner and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> some just men should stand midway, in whom certain forecasts of (His) future <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> should shine forth. And hence, even in the people from whom <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was to be born, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> appointed signs of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, which began in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, who was the first to receive the promise of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, as a sign that the covenant should be kept, as is written (<a href="../bible/gen017.htm#verse11">Genesis 17:11</a>).
