<h1>Question 4. The perfection of God</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1004.htm#article1"> Is God perfect?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1004.htm#article2"> Is God perfect universally, as having in Himself the perfections of all things?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1004.htm#article3"> Can creatures be said to be like God?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether God is perfect?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that perfection does not belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For we say a thing is perfect if it is completely made. But it does not befit <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be made. Therefore He is not perfect.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the first beginning of things. But the beginnings of things seem to be imperfect, as seed is the beginning of animal and vegetable <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is imperfect.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as shown above (Question 3, Article 4), <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. But <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> seems most imperfect, since it is most universal and receptive of all modification. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is imperfect.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written: "Be you perfect as also your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">heavenly Father</a> is perfect" (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse48">Matthew 5:48</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> relates (Metaph. xii), some ancient <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, namely, the <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagoreans</a> and Leucippus, did not predicate "best" and "most perfect" of the first principle. The reason was that the ancient <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> considered only a material principle; and a material principle is most imperfect. For since <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> as such is merely potential, the first material principle must be simply potential, and thus most imperfect. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the first principle, not material, but in the order of efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, which must be most perfect. For just as <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as such, is merely potential, an agent, as such, is in the state of <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a>. Hence, the first active principle must needs be most actual, and therefore most perfect; for a thing is perfect in proportion to its state of <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a>, because we call that perfect which lacks nothing of the mode of its perfection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (<a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">Moral</a>. v, 26,29): "Though our lips can only stammer, we yet chant the high things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." For that which is not made is improperly called perfect. Nevertheless because <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things are then called perfect, when from <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> they are brought into <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a>, this word "perfect" signifies whatever is not wanting in <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a>, whether this be by way of perfection or not.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The material principle which with us is found to be imperfect, cannot be absolutely primal; but must be preceded by something perfect. For seed, though it be the principle of animal life reproduced through seed, has previous to it, the animal or plant from which is came. Because, previous to that which is potential, must be that which is actual; since a potential being can only be reduced into act by some being already actual.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Existence is the most perfect of all things, for it is compared to all things as that by which they are made actual; for nothing has <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a> except so far as it exists. Hence <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is that which actuates all things, even their forms. Therefore it is not compared to other things as the receiver is to the received; but rather as the received to the receiver. When therefore I speak of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, or horse, or anything else, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is considered a formal principle, and as something received; and not as that which exists.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the perfections of all things are in God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the perfections of all things are not in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is simple, as shown above (Question 3, Article 7); whereas the perfections of things are many and diverse. Therefore the perfections of all things are not in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, opposites cannot coexist. Now the perfections of things are opposed to each other, for each thing is perfected by its specific difference. But the differences by which "genera" are divided, and <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">"species"</a> constituted, are opposed to each other. Therefore because opposites cannot coexist in the same subject, it seems that the perfections of all things are not in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a living thing is more perfect than what merely exists; and an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> thing than what merely lives. Therefore life is more perfect than <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> than life. But the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> itself. Therefore He has not the perfections of life, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and other similar perfections.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. v) that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> prepossesses all things."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> All created perfections are in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence He is spoken of as universally perfect, because He lacks not (says the <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Commentator</a>, Metaph. v) any excellence which may be found in any genus. This may be seen from two considerations.

<p>First, because whatever perfection exists in an effect must be found in the effective <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: either in the same formality, if it is a univocal agent--as when <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> reproduces <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; or in a more eminent degree, if it is an equivocal agent--thus in the sun is the likeness of whatever is generated by the sun's power. Now it is plain that the effect pre-exists virtually in the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: and although to pre-exist in the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> of a material <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is to pre-exist in a more imperfect way, since <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> as such is imperfect, and an agent as such is perfect; still to pre-exist virtually in the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is to pre-exist not in a more imperfect, but in a more perfect way. Since therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the first effective <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of things, the perfections of all things must pre-exist in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a more eminent way. <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> implies the same line of argument by saying of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (Div. Nom. v): "It is not that He is this and not that, but that He is all, as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all."

<p>Secondly, from what has been already <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> itself, of itself subsistent (3, 4). Consequently, He must contain within Himself the whole perfection of being. For it is clear that if some hot thing has not the whole perfection of heat, this is because heat is not participated in its full perfection; but if this heat were self-subsisting, nothing of the virtue of heat would be wanting to it. Since therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is subsisting being itself, nothing of the perfection of being can be wanting to Him. Now all created perfections are included in the perfection of being; for things are perfect, precisely so far as they have being after some fashion. It follows therefore that the perfection of no one thing is wanting to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This line of argument, too, is implied by <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. v), when he says that, "<a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">God exists</a> not in any single mode, but embraces all being within Himself, absolutely, without limitation, uniformly;" and afterwards he adds that, "He is the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> to subsisting things."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Even as the sun (as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> remarks, (Div. Nom. v), while remaining one and shining uniformly, contains within itself first and uniformly the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> of sensible things, and many and diverse <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>; "a fortiori" should all things in a kind of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> unity pre-exist in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all things; and thus things diverse and in themselves opposed to each other, pre-exist in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as one, without injury to His simplicity. This suffices for the Reply to the Second Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The same <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. v) that, although <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is more perfect than life, and life than wisdom, if they are considered as distinguished in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>; nevertheless, a living thing is more perfect than what merely <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>, because living things also <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> things both <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> and live. Although therefore <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> does not include life and wisdom, because that which participates in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> need not participate in every mode of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; nevertheless <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> includes in itself life and wisdom, because nothing of the perfection of being can be wanting to Him who is subsisting being itself.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether any creature can be like God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that no creature can be like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/psa085.htm#verse8">Psalm 85:8</a>): "There is none among the gods like unto Thee, O Lord." But of all creatures the most excellent are those which are called participation gods. Therefore still less can other creatures be said to be like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, likeness implies comparison. But there can be no comparison between things in a different "genus." Therefore neither can there be any likeness. Thus we do not say that sweetness is like whiteness. But no creature is in the same "genus" as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is no "genus," as shown above (Question 3, Article 5). Therefore no creature is like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, we speak of those things as like which agree in <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. But nothing can agree with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>; for, save in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> differ. Therefore no creature can be like to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, among like things there is mutual likeness; for like is like to like. If therefore any creature is like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will be like some creature, which is against what is said by Isaias: "To whom have you likened <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>?" (<a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse18">Isaiah 40:18</a>).

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written: "Let us make <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to our image and likeness" (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis 1:26</a>), and: "When He shall appear we shall be like to Him" (<a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse2">1 John 3:2</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since likeness is based upon agreement or communication in <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, it varies according to the many modes of communication in <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Some things are said to be like, which communicate in the same form according to the same formality, and according to the same mode; and these are said to be not merely like, but equal in their likeness; as two things equally white are said to be alike in whiteness; and this is the most perfect likeness. In another way, we speak of things as alike which communicate in <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> according to the same formality, though not according to the same measure, but according to more or less, as something less white is said to be like another thing more white; and this is imperfect likeness. In a third way some things are said to be alike which communicate in the same form, but not according to the same formality; as we see in non-univocal agents. For since every agent reproduces itself so far as it is an agent, and everything acts according to the manner of its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, the effect must in some way resemble the form of the agent. If therefore the agent is contained in the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> as its effect, there will be a likeness in <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> between that which makes and that which is made, according to the same formality of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> reproduces <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. If, however, the agent and its effect are not contained in the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, there will be a likeness, but not according to the formality of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; as things generated by the sun's heat may be in some sort spoken of as like the sun, not as though they received the form of the sun in its specific likeness, but in its generic likeness. Therefore if there is an agent not contained in any "genus," its effect will still more distantly reproduce the form of the agent, not, that is, so as to participate in the likeness of the agent's form according to the same specific or generic formality, but only according to some sort of analogy; as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is common to all. In this way all <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things, so far as they are beings, are like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the first and universal principle of all being.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. ix), when <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> declares that nothing is like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it does not mean to deny all likeness to Him. For, "the same things can be like and unlike to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: like, according as they imitate Him, as far as He, Who is not perfectly imitable, can be imitated; unlike according as they fall short of their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>," not merely in intensity and remission, as that which is less white falls short of that which is more white; but because they are not in agreement, specifically or generically.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not related to creatures as though belonging to a different "genus," but as transcending every "genus," and as the principle of all "genera."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Likeness of creatures to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not affirmed on account of agreement in <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> according to the formality of the same genus or <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but solely according to analogy, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> being, whereas other things are beings by participation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Although it may be admitted that creatures are in some sort like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it must nowise be admitted that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is like creatures; because, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. ix): "A mutual likeness may be found between things of the same order, but not between a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and that which is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a>." For, we say that a statue is like a man, but not conversely; so also a creature can be spoken of as in some sort like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but not that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is like a creature.
