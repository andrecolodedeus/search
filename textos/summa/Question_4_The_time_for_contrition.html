<h1>Question 4. The time for contrition</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5004.htm#article1"> Is the whole of this life the time for contrition?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5004.htm#article2"> Is it expedient to grieve continually for our sins?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5004.htm#article3"> Do souls grieve for their sins even after this life?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the whole of this life is the time for contrition?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the time for <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is not the whole of this life. For as we should be sorry for a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed, so should we be ashamed of it. But shame for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not last all one's life, for <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Poenit. ii) that "he whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is forgiven has nothing to be ashamed of." Therefore it seems that neither should <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> last all one's life, since it is sorrow for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse18">1 John 4:18</a>) that "perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> casteth out fear, because fear hath pain." But sorrow also has pain. Therefore the sorrow of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> cannot remain in the state of perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, there cannot be any sorrow for the past (since it is, properly speaking, about a present <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>) except in so far as something of the past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> remains in the present time. Now, in this life, sometimes one attains to a state in which nothing remains of a past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, neither disposition, nor guilt, nor any debt of punishment. Therefore there is no need to grieve any more for that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse28">Romans 8:28</a>) that "to them that love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> all things work together unto <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," even <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> declares [<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, De Correp. et Grat.]. Therefore there is no need for them to grieve for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> after it has been forgiven.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is a part of Penance, condivided with satisfaction. But there is no need for continual satisfaction. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> need not be continual.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> in De Poenitentia [De vera et falsa Poenitentia, work of an unknown author] says that "when sorrow ceases, penance fails, and when penance fails, no pardon remains." Therefore, since it behooves one not to lose the forgiveness which has been granted, it seems that one ought always to grieve for one's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p>Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/sir005.htm#verse5">Sirach 5:5</a>): "Be not without fear about <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> forgiven." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should always grieve, that his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> may be forgiven him.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 3, Article 1), there is a twofold sorrow in <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>: one is in the reason, and is detestation of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed; the other is in the sensitive part, and results from the former: and as regards both, the time for <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is the whole of the present state of life. For as long as one is a wayfarer, one detests the obstacles which retard or hinder one from reaching the end of the way. Wherefore, since past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> retards the course of our life towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (because the time which was given to us for the course cannot be recovered), it follows that the state of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> remains during the whole of this lifetime, as regards the detestation of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. The same is to be said of the sensible sorrow, which is assumed by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as a punishment: for since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, deserved <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting punishment</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting punishment</a> being commuted into a temporal one, sorrow ought to remain during the whole of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, i.e. during the whole of the state of this life. For this reason <a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugh of St. Victor</a> says [<a href="../cathen/13045c.htm">Richard of St. Victor</a>, De Pot. Lig. et Solv. 3,5,13 that "when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> absolves a man from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> guilt and punishment, He binds him with a chain of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> detestation of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Shame regards <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> only as a disgraceful act; wherefore after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has been taken away as to its guilt, there is no further motive for shame; but there does remain a motive of sorrow, which is for the guilt, not only as being something disgraceful, but also as having a hurt connected with it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Servile fear which <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> casts out, is opposed to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> by reason of its servility, because it regards the punishment. But the sorrow of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> results from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as stated above (Question 3, Article 2): wherefore the comparison fails.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although, by penance, the sinner returns to his former state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a> and immunity from the debt of punishment, yet he never returns to his former dignity of innocence, and so something always remains from his past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Just as a man ought not to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> may come of it, so he ought not to rejoice in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, for the reason that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> may perchance come from it through the agency of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a> or <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, because his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> did not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> but hindered those goods; rather was it <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a> that was their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and in this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should rejoice, whereas he should grieve for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Satisfaction depends on the punishment appointed, which should be enjoined for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; hence it can come to an end, so that there be no further need of satisfaction. But that punishment is proportionate to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> chiefly on the part of its adherence to a creature whence it derives its finiteness. On the other hand, the sorrow of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> corresponds to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> on the part of the aversion, whence it derives a certain <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>; wherefore <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> ought to continue always; nor is it unreasonable if that which precedes remains, when that which follows is taken away.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether it is expedient to grieve for sin continually?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is not expedient to grieve for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> continually. For it is sometimes expedient to rejoice, as is evident from <a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse4">Philippians 4:4</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on the words, "Rejoice in the Lord always," says that "it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to rejoice." Now it is not possible to rejoice and grieve at the same time. Therefore it is not expedient to grieve for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> continually.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which, in itself, is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and a thing to be avoided should not be taken upon oneself, except in so far as it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> as a remedy against something, as in the case of burning or cutting a wound. Now sorrow is in itself an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/sir030.htm#verse24">Sirach 30:24</a>): "Drive away sadness far from thee," and the reason is given (<a href="../bible/sir030.htm#verse25">Sirach 30:25</a>): "For sadness hath killed many, and there is no profit in it." Moreover the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says the same (Ethic. vii, 13,14; x, 5). Therefore one should not grieve for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> any longer than suffices for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to be blotted out. Now <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is already blotted out after the first sorrow of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>. Therefore it is not expedient to grieve any longer.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">Bernard</a> says (Serm. xi in Cant.): "Sorrow is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thing, if it is not continual; for honey should be mingled with wormwood." Therefore it seems that it is inexpedient to grieve continually.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [De vera et falsa Poenitentia, work of an unknown author] says: "The penitent should always grieve, and rejoice in his grief."

<p>Further, it is expedient always to continue, as far as it is possible, those acts in which beatitude consists. Now such is sorrow for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as is shown by the words of <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse5">Matthew 5:5</a>, "Blessed are they that mourn." Therefore it is expedient for sorrow to be as continual as possible.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We find this <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> in the acts of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, that in them excess and defect are not possible, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in Ethic. ii, 6,7. Wherefore, since <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, so far as it is a kind of displeasure seated in the rational <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, is an act of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of penance, there can never be excess in it, either as to its intensity, or as to its duration, except in so far as the act of one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> hinders the act of another which is more urgent for the time being. Consequently the more continually a man can perform acts of this displeasure, the better it is, provided he exercises the acts of other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> when and how he ought to. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> can have excess and defect, both in intensity and in duration. Wherefore, as the passion of sorrow, which the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> takes upon itself, ought to be moderately intense, so ought it to be of moderate duration, lest, if it should last too long, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> fall into <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, cowardice, and such like <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The sorrow of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is a hindrance to worldly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, but not to the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> which is about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and which has sorrow itself for object.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The words of <a href="../bible/sir000.htm">Ecclesiasticus</a> refer to worldly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> is referring to sorrow as a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, of which we should make moderate use, according as the end, for which it is assumed, demands.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">Bernard</a> is speaking of sorrow as a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether our souls are contrite for sins even after this life?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> even after this life. For the love of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> displeasure at <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now, after this life, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> remains in some, both as to its act and as to its <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, since "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> never falleth away." Therefore the displeasure at the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed, which is the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, remains.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, we should grieve more for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than for punishment. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> grieve for their sensible punishment and for the delay of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Much more, therefore, do they grieve for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> they committed.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the pain of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> satisfies for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But satisfaction derives its efficacy from the power of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> remains after this life.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is a part of the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> do not endure after this life. Neither, therefore, does <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> can be so great as to blot out both guilt and punishment. If therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> could have <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, it would be possible for their debt of punishment to be remitted through the power of their <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, so that they would be delivered from their sensible pain, which is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Three things are to be observed in <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>: first, its genus, viz. sorrow; secondly, its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, for it is an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> quickened by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; thirdly, its efficacy, for it is a <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> and sacramental act, and, to a certain extent, satisfactory. Accordingly, after this life, those <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> which dwell in the heavenly country, cannot have <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, because they are void of sorrow by reason of the fulness of their <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>: those which are in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, have no <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, for although they have sorrow, they lack the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which quickens sorrow; while those which are in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> have a sorrow for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, that is quickened by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; yet it is not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>, for they are not in the state of meriting. In this life, however, all these three can be found.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> this sorrow, save in those who are capable of it; but the fulness of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in the Blessed excludes all capability of sorrow from them: wherefore, though they have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, they have no <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> grieve for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; but their sorrow is not <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, because it lacks the efficacy of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The pain which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> suffer in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>, cannot, properly speaking, be called satisfaction, because satisfaction demands a <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> work; yet, in a broad sense, the payment of the punishment due may be called satisfaction.
