<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether this is a fitting definition of faith: "Faith is the substance of things to be hoped for, the evidence of things that appear not?"</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> gives an unfitting definition of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (<a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse1">Hebrews 11:1</a>) when he says: "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of things to be hoped for, the evidence of things that appear not." For no <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>: whereas <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, since it is a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated above (I-II, 62, 3). Therefore it is not a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, different <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> have different objects. Now things to be hoped for are the object of hope. Therefore they should not be included in a definition of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as though they were its object.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is perfected by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> rather than by hope, since <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is the form of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as we shall state further on (3). Therefore the definition of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> should have included the thing to be loved rather than the thing to be hoped for.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the same thing should not be placed in different genera. Now "<a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>" and "evidence" are different genera, and neither is subalternate to the other. Therefore it is unfitting to state that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is both "<a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>" and "evidence."

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, evidence manifests the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> for which it is adduced. Now a thing is said to be apparent when its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is already manifest. Therefore it seems to imply a contradiction to speak of "evidence of things that appear not": and so <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is unfittingly defined.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The authority of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> suffices.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Though some say that the above words of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> are not a definition of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, yet if we consider the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> aright, this definition overlooks none of the points in reference to which <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> can be defined, albeit the words themselves are not arranged in the form of a definition, just as the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> touch on the principles of the syllogism, without employing the syllogistic form.

<p>In order to make this clear, we must observe that since <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by their acts, and acts by their objects, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, being a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, should be defined by its proper act in relation to its proper object. Now the act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, as stated above (2, 2,3), which is an act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> determinate to one object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will's</a> command. Hence an act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is related both to the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, i.e. to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and the end, and to the object of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, i.e. to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. And since <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, through being a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as stated above (I-II, 62, 2), has one same thing for object and end, its object and end must, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, be in proportion to one another. Now it has been already stated (1, 1,4) that the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the First Truth, as unseen, and whatever we hold on account thereof: so that it must needs be under the aspect of something unseen that the First Truth is the end of the act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which aspect is that of a thing hoped for, according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse25">Romans 8:25</a>): "We hope for that which we see not": because to see the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is to possess it. Now one hopes not for what one has already, but for what one has not, as stated above (I-II, 67, 4). Accordingly the relation of the act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to its end which is the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, is indicated by the words: "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of things to be hoped for." For we are wont to call by the name of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, the first beginning of a thing, especially when the whole subsequent thing is virtually contained in the first beginning; for instance, we might say that the first self-evident principles are the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of science, because, to wit, these principles are in us the first beginnings of science, the whole of which is itself contained in them virtually. On this way then <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is said to be the "<a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of things to be hoped for," for the reason that in us the first beginning of things to be hoped for is brought about by the assent of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which contains virtually all things to be hoped for. Because we hope to be made <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> through seeing the unveiled <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to which our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> cleaves, as was made evident when we were speaking of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> (I-II, 3, 8; I-II, 4, 3).

<p>The relationship of the act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to the object of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, considered as the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, is indicated by the words, "evidence of things that appear not," where "evidence" is taken for the result of evidence. For evidence induces the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to adhere to a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, wherefore the firm adhesion of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to the non-apparent <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is called "evidence" here. Hence another reading has "conviction," because to wit, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of the believer is convinced by Divine authority, so as to assent to what it sees not. Accordingly if anyone would reduce the foregoing words to the form of a definition, he may say that "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, whereby <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> is begun in us, making the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> assent to what is non-apparent."

<p>In this way <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is distinguished from all other things pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. For when we describe it as "evidence," we distinguish it from opinion, suspicion, and <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, which do not make the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> adhere to anything firmly; when we go on to say, "of things that appear not," we distinguish it from science and understanding, the object of which is something apparent; and when we say that it is "the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of things to be hoped for," we distinguish the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> commonly so called, which has no reference to the beatitude we hope for.

<p>Whatever other definitions are given of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, are explanations of this one given by the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>. For when <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. xl in Joan.: QQ. Evang. ii, qu. 39) that "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> whereby we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what we do not see," and when <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iv, 11) that "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is an assent without research," and when others say that "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is that <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> about absent things which surpasses opinion but falls short of science," these all amount to the same as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle's</a> words: "Evidence of things that appear not"; and when <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. vii) that "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the solid foundation of the believer, establishing him in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and showing forth the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in him," comes to the same as "<a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of things to be hoped for."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> "Substance" here does not stand for the supreme genus condivided with the other genera, but for that likeness to <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> which is found in each genus, inasmuch as the first thing in a genus contains the others virtually and is said to be the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> thereof.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> pertains to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> as commanded by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, it must needs be directed, as to its end, to the objects of those <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which perfect the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, among which is hope, as we shall <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> further on (18, 1). For this reason the definition of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> includes the object of hope.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Love may be of the seen and of the unseen, of the present and of the absent. Consequently a thing to be loved is not so adapted to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as a thing to be hoped for, since hope is always of the absent and the unseen.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> "Substance" and "evidence" as included in the definition of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, do not denote various genera of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, nor different acts, but different relationships of one act to different objects, as is clear from what has been said.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Evidence taken from the proper principles of a thing, make it apparent, whereas evidence taken from Divine authority does not make a thing apparent in itself, and such is the evidence referred to in the definition of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether faith resides in the intellect?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> does not reside in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Praedest. Sanct. v) that "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> resides in the believer's will." Now the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is a power distinct from the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> does not reside in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the assent of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> anything, proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> obeying <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> owes all its praise to obedience. Now obedience is in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and not in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is either speculative or practical. Now <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not in the speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, since this is not concerned with things to be sought or avoided, as stated in De Anima iii, 9, so that it is not a principle of operation, whereas "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> . . . worketh by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>" (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse6">Galatians 5:6</a>). Likewise, neither is it in the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, the object of which is some <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, contingent thing, that can be made or done. For the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">Eternal</a> Truth, as was shown above (Question 1, Article 1). Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> does not reside in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> is succeeded by the heavenly vision, according to <a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>: "We see now through a glass in a dark manner; but then face to face." Now vision is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is likewise.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, its act must needs be perfect. Now, for the perfection of an act proceeding from two active principles, each of these principles must be perfect: for it is not possible for a thing to be sawn well, unless the sawyer possess the art, and the saw be well fitted for sawing. Now, in a power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is related to opposite objects, a disposition to act well is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, as stated above (I-II, 49, 4, ad 1,2,3). Wherefore an act that proceeds from two such powers must be perfected by a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> residing in each of them. Again, it has been stated above (2, 1,2) that to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> is an act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> moves it to assent. And this act proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, both of which have a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> aptitude to be perfected in this way. Consequently, if the act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is to be perfect, there needs to be a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as well as in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>: even as there needs to be the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> in the reason, besides the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty, in order that the act of that faculty be perfect. Now, to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> is immediately an act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, because the object of that act is "the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>," which pertains properly to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Consequently <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which is the proper principle of that act, must needs reside in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> takes <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> for the act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which is described as depending on the believer's will, in so far as his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> assents to matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> at the command of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Not only does the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> need to be ready to obey but also the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> needs to be well disposed to follow the command of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, even as the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty needs to be well disposed in order to follow the command of reason; hence there needs to be a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> not only in the commanding will but also in the assenting <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> resides in the speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as evidenced by its object. But since this object, which is the First Truth, is the end of all our desires and actions, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> proves (De Trin. i, 8), it follows that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> worketh by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> just as "the speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> becomes practical by extension" (De Anima iii, 10).

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether charity is the form of faith?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not the form of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For each thing derives its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. When therefore two things are opposite members of a division, one cannot be the form of the other. Now <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> are stated to be opposite members of a division, as different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse13">1 Corinthians 13:13</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not the form of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a form and the thing of which it is the form are in one subject, since together they form one simply. Now <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, while <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not the form of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the form of a thing is a principle thereof. Now obedience, rather than <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, seems to be the principle of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a>, on the part of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse5">Romans 1:5</a>: "For obedience to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>." Therefore obedience rather than <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, is the form of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Each thing works through its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> works through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore the love of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is the form of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As appears from what has been said above (I-II, 1, 3; I-II, 18, 6), <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> acts take their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from their end which is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will's</a> object. Now that which gives a thing its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, is after the manner of a form in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things. Wherefore the form of any <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> act is, in a manner, the end to which that act is directed, both because it takes its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> therefrom, and because the mode of an action should correspond proportionately to the end. Now it is evident from what has been said (1), that the act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is directed to the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as to its end: and this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is the end of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, viz. the Divine Good, is the proper object of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is called the form of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in so far as the act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is perfected and formed by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> is called the form of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> because it quickens the act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Now nothing hinders one act from being quickened by different <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, so as to be reduced to various <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in a certain order, as stated above (I-II, 18, 6,7; I-II, 61, 2) when we were treating of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> in general.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This objection is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of an intrinsic form. But it is not thus that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is the form of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but in the sense that it quickens the act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as explained above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Even obedience, and hope likewise, and whatever other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> might precede the act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, is quickened by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as we shall show further on (23, 8), and consequently <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is spoken of as the form of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether lifeless faith can become living, or living faith, lifeless?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> does not become living, or living <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> lifeless. For, according to <a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse10">1 Corinthians 13:10</a>, "when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done away." Now lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is imperfect in comparison with living <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Therefore when living <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> comes, lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is done away, so that they are not one identical <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a dead thing does not become a living thing. Now lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is dead, according to <a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse20">James 2:20</a>: "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> without works is dead." Therefore lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> cannot become living.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, by its advent, has no less effect in a believer than in an unbeliever. Now by coming to an unbeliever it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Therefore when it comes to a believer, who hitherto had the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> another <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in him.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (In Categ. Arist. i), "<a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> cannot be altered." Now <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>. Therefore the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> cannot be at one time living, and at another, lifeless.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on the words, "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> without works is dead" (<a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse20">James 2:20</a>) adds, "by which it lives once more." Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which was lifeless and without form hitherto, becomes formed and living.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There have been various opinions on this question. For some [William of Auxerre, Sum. Aur. III, iii, 15 have said that living and lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are distinct <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, but that when living <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> comes, lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is done away, and that, in like manner, when a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally after having living <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, a new <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is infused into him by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But it seems unfitting that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> should deprive <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by coming to him, and that a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should be infused into <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, on account of a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>Consequently others [<a href="../cathen/01298a.htm">Alexander of Hales</a>, Sum. Theol. iii, 64 have said that living and lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are indeed distinct <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, but that, all the same, when living <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> comes the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not taken away, and that it remains together with the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of living <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the same subject. Yet again it seems unreasonable that the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> should remain inactive in a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> having living <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p>We must therefore hold differently that living and lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are one and the same <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. The reason is that a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is differentiated by that which directly pertains to that <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. Now since <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is a perfection of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, that pertains directly to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which pertains to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Again, what pertains to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, does not pertain directly to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so as to be able to differentiate the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But the distinction of living from lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is in respect of something pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, i.e. <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and not in respect of something pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore living and lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are not distinct <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The saying of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> refers to those imperfect things from which imperfection is inseparable, for then, when the perfect comes the imperfect must needs be done away. Thus with the advent of clear vision, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is done away, because it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> "of the things that appear not." When, however, imperfection is not inseparable from the imperfect thing, the same identical thing which was imperfect becomes perfect. Thus childhood is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and consequently the same identical subject who was a child, becomes a man. Now lifelessness is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> thereto as stated above. Therefore lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself becomes living.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> That which makes an animal live is inseparable from an animal, because it is its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form, viz. the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: consequently a dead thing cannot become a living thing, and a living and a dead thing differ specifically. On the other hand that which gives <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, or makes it live, is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Hence there is no comparison.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Grace</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> not only when <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> begins anew to be in a man, but also as long as <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> lasts. For it has been said above (I, 104, 1; I-II, 109, 9) that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is always working <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>, even as the sun is always lighting up the air. Hence <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not less effective when it comes to a believer than when it comes to an unbeliever: since it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in both, in the former by confirming and perfecting it, in the latter by creating it anew.

<p>We might also reply that it is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>, namely on account of the disposition of the subject, that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in one who has it already: just as, on the other hand, a second mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not take away <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> from one who has already lost it through a previous mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> When living <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> becomes lifeless, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not changed, but its subject, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which at one time has <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and at another time, with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether faith is a virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is directed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since "it is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that makes its subject <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. ii, 6). But <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is directed to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, infused <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is more perfect than acquired <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, on account of its imperfection, is not placed among the acquired <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. vi, 3). Much less, therefore, can it be considered an infused <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, living and lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>). Now lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since it is not connected with the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Therefore neither is living <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> and the fruits are distinct from the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. But <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is numbered among the gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> (<a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse9">1 Corinthians 12:9</a>) and likewise among the fruits (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse23">Galatians 5:23</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> is justified by the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, since "<a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. v, 1). Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is justified by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> according to <a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse1">Romans 5:1</a>: "Being justified therefore by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> let us have peace," etc. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As shown above, it is by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> are rendered <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; hence, any <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> that is always the principle of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> act, may be called a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Such a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is living <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For since to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> is an act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> assenting to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> at the command of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, two things are required that this act may be perfect: one of which is that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> should infallibly tend to its object, which is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; while the other is that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> should be infallibly directed to the last end, on account of which it assents to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: and both of these are to be found in the act of living <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For it belongs to the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> should ever tend to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, since nothing <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> can be the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> above (Question 1, Article 3): while the effect of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which is the form of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, is that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> ever has its will directed to a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> end. Therefore living <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p>On the other hand, lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, because, though the act of lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is duly perfect on the part of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, it has not its due perfection as regards the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: just as if <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> be in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>, without <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> being in the rational part, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated above (I-II, 65, 1), because the act of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> requires both an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, and an act of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty, even as the act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> requires an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and an act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is itself the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, since it is its perfection: and consequently <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has a relation to some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in so far as it directs the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Furthermore, it has a relation to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> considered as the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, inasmuch as it is formed by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of which the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> speaks is based on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> reasoning in a conclusion which does not follow, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, from its premisses; and which is subject to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>: hence such like <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. On the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of which we are speaking is based on the Divine Truth, which is <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a>, and consequently its object cannot be anything <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>; so that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of this kind can be a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Living and lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> do not differ specifically, as though they belonged to different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But they differ as perfect and imperfect within the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Hence lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, being imperfect, does not satisfy the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of a perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, for "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a kind of perfection" (Phys. vii, text. 18).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Some say that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is numbered among the gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> is lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But this is said without reason, since the gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>, which are mentioned in that passage, are not common to all the members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says: "There are diversities of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>," and again, "To one is given" this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and "to another" that. Now lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is common to all members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, because its lifelessness is not part of its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, if we consider it as a gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>. We must, therefore, say that in that passage, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> denotes a certain excellency of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, for instance, "constancy in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>," according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a>, or the "word of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>."

<p><a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> is numbered among the fruits, in so far as it gives a certain pleasure in its act by reason of its <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>, wherefore the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on the fifth chapter to the Galatians, where the fruits are enumerated, explains <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as being "<a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> about the unseen."

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether faith is one virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not one. For just as <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> according to <a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse8">Ephesians 2:8</a>, so also wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> are numbered among <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> according to <a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse2">Isaiah 11:2</a>. Now wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> differ in this, that wisdom is about <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> things, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> about temporal things, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Trin. xii, 14,15). Since, then, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is about <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> things, and also about some temporal things, it seems that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but divided into several parts.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, confession is an act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as stated above (Question 3, Article 1). Now confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not one and the same for all: since what we confess as past, the fathers of old confessed as yet to come, as appears from <a href="../bible/isa007.htm#verse14">Isaiah 7:14</a>: "Behold a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> shall conceive." Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not one.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is common to all believers in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But one <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> cannot be in many subjects. Therefore all cannot have one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse5">Ephesians 4:5</a>): "One Lord, one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> If we take <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, we can consider it in two ways. First on the part of the object, and thus there is one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Because the formal object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the First Truth, by adhering to which we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> whatever is contained in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Secondly, on the part of the subject, and thus <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is differentiated according as it is in various subjects. Now it is evident that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, just as any other <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, takes its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the formal aspect of its object, but is individualized by its subject. Hence if we take <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> for the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> whereby we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, it is one specifically, but differs numerically according to its various subjects.

<p>If, on the other hand, we take <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> for that which is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, then, again, there is one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, since what is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> by all is one same thing: for though the things <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, which all agree in <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a>, be diverse from one another, yet they are all reduced to one.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Temporal matters which are proposed to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, do not belong to the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, except in relation to something <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, viz. the First Truth, as stated above (Question 1, Article 1). Hence there is one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of things both temporal and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. It is different with wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which consider temporal and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> matters under their respective aspects.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This difference of past and future arises, not from any difference in the thing <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, but from the different relationships of believers to the one thing <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, as also we have mentioned above (I-II, 103, 4; I-II, 107, 1, ad 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This objection considers numerical diversity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether faith is the first of the virtues?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not the first of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse4">Luke 12:4</a>, "I say to you My friends," says that <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is the foundation of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Now the foundation precedes that which is founded thereon. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not the first of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/psa036.htm">Psalm 36</a>, "Be not emulous," says that hope "leads on to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>." Now hope is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as we shall state further on (17, 1). Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not the first of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it was stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>) that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of the believer is moved, out of obedience to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to assent to matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Now obedience also is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not the first <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, not lifeless but living <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the foundation, as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> remarks on <a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse11">1 Corinthians 3:11</a> [<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, De Fide et Oper. xvi.]. Now <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is formed by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). Therefore it is owing to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the foundation: so that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is the foundation yet more than <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is (for the foundation is the first part of a building) and consequently it seems to precede <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the order of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> is taken from the order of acts. Now, in the act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> which is perfected by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, precedes the act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which is perfected by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> which precedes its effect. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> precedes <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not the first of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse1">Hebrews 11:1</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of things to be hoped for." Now the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of a thing is that which comes first. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is first among the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> One thing can precede another in two ways: first, by its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; secondly, by <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>. <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, by its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, precedes all other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For since the end is the principle in matters of action, as stated above (I-II, 13, 3; I-II, 34, 4, ad 1), the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, the object of which is the last end, must needs precede all the others. Again, the last end must of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> be present to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> before it is present to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> has no inclination for anything except in so far as it is apprehended by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Hence, as the last end is present in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> by hope and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the first of all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> must, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, be <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, because <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> cannot reach <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the object of heavenly bliss, which is the aspect under which hope and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> tend towards Him.

<p>On the other hand, some <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> can precede <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>. For an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> precedes its effect <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>. Now that which removes an obstacle is a kind of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Phys. viii, 4): and in this sense certain <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> may be said to precede <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, in so far as they remove obstacles to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. Thus <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> removes the inordinate fear that hinders <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> removes <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, whereby a man refuses to submit himself to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The same may be said of some other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, although there are no real <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, unless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> be presupposed, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (Contra Julian. iv, 3).

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Hope cannot lead to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> absolutely. For one cannot hope to obtain <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, unless one <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> this possible, since hope does not tend to the impossible, as stated above (I-II, 40, 1). It is, however, possible for one to be led by hope to persevere in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or to hold firmly to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and it is in this sense that hope is said to lead to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Obedience is twofold: for sometimes it denotes the inclination of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to fulfil <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> commandments. On this way it is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but is a general <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; since all acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> come under the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, as stated above (I-II, 100, 2); and thus it is requisite for <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. On another way, obedience denotes an inclination to fulfil the commandments considered as a <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. On this way it is a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: for a man does his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> by his superior when he obeys him: and thus obedience follows <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is his superior, Whom he must obey.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> To be a foundation a thing requires not only to come first, but also to be connected with the other parts of the building: since the building would not be founded on it unless the other parts adhered to it. Now the connecting bond of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> edifice is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, according to <a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse14">Colossians 3:14</a>: "Above all . . . things have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> which is the bond of perfection." Consequently <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> cannot be the foundation: and yet it does not follow that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> precedes <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Some act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is required before <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but not an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> quickened by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. This latter act presupposes <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> cannot tend to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with perfect love, unless the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> possesses right <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> about Him.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether faith is more certain than science and the other intellectual virtues?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not more <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> than science and the other <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> is opposed to <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a>, wherefore a thing would seem to be the more <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>, through being less <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>, just as a thing is the whiter, the less it has of an admixture of black. Now understanding, science and also wisdom are free of any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about their objects; whereas the believer may sometimes suffer a movement of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is no more <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> than the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, sight is more <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> than hearing. But "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is through hearing" according to <a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse17">Romans 10:17</a>; whereas understanding, science and wisdom imply some kind of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> sight. Therefore science and understanding are more <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> than <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p>Further, in matters concerning the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, the more perfect is the more <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>. Now understanding is more perfect than <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, since <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the way to understanding, according to another version [the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>] of <a href="../bible/isa007.htm#verse9">Isaiah 7:9</a>: "If you will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, you shall not understand [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'continue']": and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiv, 1) that "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is strengthened by science." Therefore it seems that science or understanding is more <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> than <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1th002.htm#verse15">1 Thessalonians 2:15</a>): "When you had received of us the word of the hearing," i.e. by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> . . . "you received it not as the word of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but, as it is indeed, the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Now nothing is more <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> than the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore science is not more <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> than <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; nor is anything else.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (I-II, 57, 4, ad 2) two of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are about contingent <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, viz. <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and art; to which <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is preferable in point of <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a>, by reason of its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, since it is about <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> things, which never change, whereas the other three <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, viz. wisdom, science [In English the corresponding '<a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>' is called <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>] and understanding, are about <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> things, as stated above (I-II, 57, 5, ad 3). But it must be observed that wisdom, science and understanding may be taken in two ways: first, as <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vi, 2,3); secondly, for the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. If we consider them in the first way, we must note that <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> can be looked at in two ways. First, on the part of its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and thus a thing which has a more <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, is itself more <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>. On this way <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is more <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> than those three <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, because it is founded on the Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, whereas the aforesaid three <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are based on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Secondly, <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> may be considered on the part of the subject, and thus the more a man's <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> lays hold of a thing, the more <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> it is. On this way, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is less certain, because matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are above the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, whereas the objects of the aforesaid three <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not. Since, however, a thing is judged simply with regard to its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but relatively, with respect to a disposition on the part of the subject, it follows that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is more <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> simply, while the others are more <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> relatively, i.e. for us. Likewise if these three be taken as <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> received in this present life, they are related to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as to their principle which they presuppose: so that again, in this way, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is more <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> is not on the side of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but on our side, in so far as we do not fully grasp matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Other things being equal sight is more <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> than hearing; but if (the authority of) the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> from whom we hear greatly surpasses that of the seer's sight, hearing is more <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> than sight: thus a man of little science is more <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> about what he hears on the authority of an expert in science, than about what is apparent to him according to his own reason: and much more is a man certain about what he hears from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who cannot be deceived, than about what he sees with his own reason, which can be mistaken.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of understanding and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> are more perfect than the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the point of their greater clearness, but not in regard to more <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> adhesion: because the whole <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of understanding and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, arises from the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, even as the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of conclusions arises from the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> of premisses. But in so far as science, wisdom and understanding are <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, they are based upon the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> light of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, which falls short of the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> word, on which <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is founded.
