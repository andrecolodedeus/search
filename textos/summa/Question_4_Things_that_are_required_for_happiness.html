<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether delight is required for happiness?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that delight is not required for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. i, 8) that "vision is the entire reward of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>." But the prize or reward of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> clearly states (Ethic. i, 9). Therefore nothing besides vision is required for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is "the most self-sufficient of all goods," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> declares (Ethic. i, 7). But that which needs something else is not self-sufficient. Since then the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated above (Question 3, Article 8); it seems that delight is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the "operation of bliss or <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> should be unhindered" (Ethic. vii, 13). But delight hinders the operation of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>: since it destroys the estimate of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> (Ethic. vi, 5). Therefore delight is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. x, 23) that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is "<a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> One thing may be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for another in four ways. First, as a preamble and preparation to it: thus instruction is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for science. Secondly, as perfecting it: thus the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the life of the body. Thirdly, as helping it from without: thus friends are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for some undertaking. Fourthly, as something attendant on it: thus we might say that heat is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for fire. And in this way delight is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. For it is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> being at rest in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> attained. Wherefore, since <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is nothing else but the attainment of the Sovereign Good, it cannot be without concomitant delight.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> From the very fact that a reward is given to anyone, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of him who deserves it is at rest, and in this consists delight. Consequently, delight is included in the very notion of reward.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The very sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> delight. Consequently, he who sees <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot need delight.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Delight that is attendant upon the operation of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> does not hinder it, rather does it perfect it, as stated in Ethic. x, 4: since what we do with delight, we do with greater care and perseverance. On the other hand, delight which is extraneous to the operation is a hindrance thereto: sometimes by distracting the attention because, as already observed, we are more attentive to those things that delight us; and when we are very attentive to one thing, we must needs be less attentive to another: sometimes on account of opposition; thus a sensual delight that is contrary to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, hinders the estimate of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> more than it hinders the estimate of the speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether in happiness vision ranks before delight?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, delight ranks before vision. For "delight is the perfection of operation" (Ethic. x, 4). But perfection ranks before the thing perfected. Therefore delight ranks before the operation of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, i.e. vision.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that by reason of which a thing is desirable, is yet more desirable. But operations are desired on account of the delight they afford: hence, too, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> has adjusted delight to those operations which are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the preservation of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, lest animals should disregard such operations. Therefore, in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, delight ranks before the operation of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which is vision.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, vision corresponds to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; while delight or enjoyment corresponds to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. But <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> ranks before <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse13">1 Corinthians 13:13</a>). Therefore delight or enjoyment ranks before vision.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is greater than its effect. But vision is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of delight. Therefore vision ranks before delight.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> discusses this question (Ethic. x, 4), and leaves it unsolved. But if one consider the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> carefully, the operation of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> which is vision, must needs rank before delight. For delight consists in a certain repose of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Now that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> finds rest in anything, can only be on account of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of that thing in which it reposes. If therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> reposes in an operation, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will's</a> repose is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the operation. Nor does the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> seek <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for the sake of repose; for thus the very act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> would be the end, which has been disproved above (1, 1, ad 2; 3, 4): but it seeks to be at rest in the operation, because that operation is its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Consequently it is evident that the operation in which the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> reposes ranks before the resting of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> therein.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. x, 4) "delight perfects operation as vigor perfects youth," because it is a result of youth. Consequently delight is a perfection attendant upon vision; but not a perfection whereby vision is made perfect in its own <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The apprehension of the senses does not attain to the universal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but to some particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is delightful. And consequently, according to the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> which is in animals, operations are sought for the sake of delight. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> apprehends the universal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, the attainment of which results in delight: wherefore its purpose is directed to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> rather than to delight. Hence it is that the Divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which is the Author of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, adjusted delights to operations on account of the operations. And we should form our estimate of things not simply according to the order of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, but rather according to the order of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> does not seem the beloved <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for the sake of delight: it is for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> a consequence that it delights in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> gained which it loves. Thus delight does not answer to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> as its end, but vision does, whereby the end is first made present to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether comprehension is necessary for happiness?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that comprehension is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ad Paulinam de Videndo Deum; [Cf. Serm. xxxciii De Verb. Dom.]): "To reach <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, to comprehend Him is impossible." Therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is without comprehension.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as to his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> part, wherein there are no other powers than the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will, as stated in the I, 79 and following. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is sufficiently perfected by seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> by enjoying Him. Therefore there is no need for comprehension as a third.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in an operation. But operations are determined by their objects: and there are two universal objects, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: of which the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> corresponds to vision, and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to delight. Therefore there is no need for comprehension as a third.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse24">1 Corinthians 9:24</a>): "So run that you may comprehend [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'obtain']." But <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is the goal of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> race: hence he says (<a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse7">2 Timothy 4:7-8</a>): "I have fought a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; as to the rest there is laid up for me a crown of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>." Therefore comprehension is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for Happiness.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since Happiness consists in gaining the last end, those things that are required for Happiness must be gathered from the way in which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is ordered to an end. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is ordered to an intelligible end partly through his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and partly through his will: through his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, in so far as a certain imperfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the end pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>: through the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, first by love which is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will's</a> first movement towards anything; secondly, by a real relation of the lover to the thing beloved, which relation may be threefold. For sometimes the thing beloved is present to the lover: and then it is no longer sought for. Sometimes it is not present, and it is impossible to attain it: and then, too, it is not sought for. But sometimes it is possible to attain it, yet it is raised above the capability of the attainer, so that he cannot have it forthwith; and this is the relation of one that hopes, to that which he hopes for, and this relation alone <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a search for the end. To these three, there are a corresponding three in Happiness itself. For perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the end corresponds to imperfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; presence of the end corresponds to the relation of hope; but delight in the end now present results from love, as already stated (02, ad 3). And therefore these three must concur with Happiness; to wit, vision, which is perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the intelligible end; comprehension, which implies presence of the end; and delight or enjoyment, which implies repose of the lover in the object beloved.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Comprehension is twofold. First, inclusion of the comprehended in the comprehensor; and thus whatever is comprehended by the finite, is itself finite. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be thus comprehended by a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Secondly, comprehension means nothing but the holding of something already present and possessed: thus one who runs after another is said to comprehend [In English we should say 'catch.'] him when he lays hold on him. And in this sense comprehension is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for Happiness.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as hope and love pertain to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, because it is the same one that loves a thing, and that tends towards it while not possessed, so, too, comprehension and delight belong to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, since it is the same that possesses a thing and reposes therein.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Comprehension is not a distinct operation from vision; but a certain relation to the end already gained. Wherefore even vision itself, or the thing seen, inasmuch as it is present, is the object of comprehension.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether rectitude of the will is necessary for happiness?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that rectitude of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for Happiness. For Happiness consists <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> in an operation of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as stated above (Question 3, Article 4). But rectitude of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, by reason of which men are said to be clean of heart, is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the perfect operation of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>: for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Retract. i, 4) "I do not approve of what I said in a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>: O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who didst will none but the clean of heart to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For it can be answered that many who are not clean of heart, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> many <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>." Therefore rectitude of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for Happiness.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, what precedes does not depend on what follows. But the operation of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> precedes the operation of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore Happiness, which is the perfect operation of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, does not depend on rectitude of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that which is ordained to another as its end, is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, when the end is already gained; as a ship, for instance, after arrival in port. But rectitude of will, which is by reason of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, is ordained to Happiness as to its end. Therefore, Happiness once obtained, rectitude of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is no longer <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse8">Matthew 5:8</a>): "Blessed are the clean of heart; for they shall see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>": and (<a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse14">Hebrews 12:14</a>): "Follow peace with all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>; without which no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Rectitude of <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for Happiness both antecedently and concomitantly. Antecedently, because rectitude of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> consists in being duly ordered to the last end. Now the end in comparison to what is ordained to the end is as form compared to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Wherefore, just as <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> cannot receive a form, unless it be duly disposed thereto, so nothing gains an end, except it be duly ordained thereto. And therefore none can obtain Happiness, without rectitude of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Concomitantly, because as stated above (Question 3, Article 8), final Happiness consists in the vision of the Divine Essence, Which is the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. So that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of him who sees the Essence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, loves, whatever he loves, in subordination to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; just as the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of him who sees not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> Essence, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, loves whatever he loves, under the common notion of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>. And this is precisely what makes the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> right. Wherefore it is evident that Happiness cannot be without a right <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Every act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is preceded by an act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>: but a certain act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> precedes a certain act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> tends to the final act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> which is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. And consequently right inclination of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is required antecedently for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, just as the arrow must take a right course in order to strike the target.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Not everything that is ordained to the end, ceases with the getting of the end: but only that which involves imperfection, such as movement. Hence the instruments of movement are no longer <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> when the end has been gained: but the due order to the end is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the body is necessary for man's happiness?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the body is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for Happiness. For the perfection of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> presupposes the perfection of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But Happiness is the perfection of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, without the body, has not the perfection of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; since it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> a part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and every part is imperfect while separated from its whole. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> without the body.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, Happiness is a perfect operation, as stated above (3, 2,5). But perfect operation follows perfect being: since nothing operates except in so far as it is an actual being. Since, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has not perfect being, while it is separated from the body, just as neither has a part, while separate from its whole; it seems that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> without the body.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, Happiness is the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, without the body, is not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore Happiness cannot be in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> separated from the body.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vii, 13) "the operation of bliss," in which operation <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists, is "not hindered." But the operation of the separate <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is hindered; because, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 35), the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> "has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> desire to rule the body, the result of which is that it is held back, so to speak, from tending with all its might to the heavenward journey," i.e. to the vision of the Divine Essence. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> without the body.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, Happiness is the sufficient <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and lulls desire. But this cannot be said of the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; for it yet desires to be united to the body, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 35). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> while separated from the body.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, in Happiness <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is equal to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> without the body is not equal to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 35). Therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/rev014.htm#verse13">Apocalypse 14:13</a>): "Happy [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'blessed'] are the dead who die in the Lord."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Happiness is twofold; the one is imperfect and is had in this life; the other is perfect, consisting in the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a>. Now it is evident that the body is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of this life. For the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of this life consists in an operation of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, either speculative or practical. And the operation of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in this life cannot be without a phantasm, which is only in a bodily organ, as was shown in the I, 84, 6,7. Consequently that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> which can be had in this life, depends, in a way, on the body. But as to perfect Happiness, which consists in the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a>, some have maintained that it is not possible to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> separated from the body; and have said that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, when separated from their bodies, do not attain to that Happiness until the Day of Judgment, when they will receive their bodies back again. And this is shown to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, both by authority and by reason. By authority, since the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse6">2 Corinthians 5:6</a>): "While we are in the body, we are absent from the Lord"; and he points out the reason of this absence, saying: "For we walk by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and not by sight." Now from this it is clear that so long as we walk by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and not by sight, bereft of the vision of the Divine Essence, we are not present to the Lord. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, separated from their bodies, are in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> presence; wherefore the text continues: "But we are confident and have a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will to be absent . . . from the body, and to be present with the Lord." Whence it is evident that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, separated from their bodies, "walk by sight," seeing the Essence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, wherein is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Happiness.

<p>Again this is made clear by reason. For the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> needs not the body, for its operation, save on account of the phantasms, wherein it looks on the intelligible <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as stated in the I, 84, 7. Now it is evident that the Divine Essence cannot be seen by means of phantasms, as stated in the I, 12, 3. Wherefore, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> perfect Happiness consists in the vision of the Divine Essence, it does not depend on the body. Consequently, without the body the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> can be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>.

<p>We must, however, notice that something may belong to a thing's perfection in two ways. First, as constituting the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> thereof; thus the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> perfection. Secondly, as <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for its well-being: thus, beauty of body and keenness of perfection belong to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> perfection. Wherefore though the body does not belong in the first way to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> Happiness, yet it does in the second way. For since operation depends on a thing's <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the more perfect is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the more perfectly it has its proper operation, wherein its <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists. Hence, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, after inquiring (Gen. ad lit. xii, 35) "whether that perfect Happiness can be ascribed to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the dead separated from their bodies," answers "that they cannot see the Unchangeable Substance, as the blessed <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> see It; either for some other more hidden reason, or because they have a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> desire to rule the body."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Happiness is the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> on the part of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, in respect of which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> transcends the organs of the body; but not according as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> form of the body. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> retains that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> perfection in respect of which <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is due to it, though it does not retain that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> perfection in respect of which it is the form of the body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The relation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to being is not the same as that of other parts: for the being of the whole is not that of any <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> part: wherefore, either the part ceases altogether to be, when the whole is destroyed, just as the parts of an animal, when the animal is destroyed; or, if they remain, they have another actual being, just as a part of a line has another being from that of the whole line. But the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> retains the being of the composite after the destruction of the body: and this because the being of the form is the same as that of its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and this is the being of the composite. Now the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> subsists in its own being, as stated in the I, 75, 2. It follows, therefore, that after being separated from the body it has perfect being and that consequently it can have a perfect operation; although it has not the perfect specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Happiness belongs to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in respect of his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>: and, therefore, since the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> remains, it can have Happiness. Thus the teeth of an Ethiopian, in respect of which he is said to be white, can retain their whiteness, even after extraction.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> One thing is hindered by another in two ways. First, by way of opposition; thus cold hinders the action of heat: and such a hindrance to operation is repugnant to Happiness. Secondly, by way of some kind of defect, because, to wit, that which is hindered has not all that is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to make it perfect in every way: and such a hindrance to operation is not incompatible with Happiness, but prevents it from being perfect in every way. And thus it is that separation from the body is said to hold the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> back from tending with all its might to the vision of the Divine Essence. For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> desires to enjoy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in such a way that the enjoyment also may overflow into the body, as far as possible. And therefore, as long as it enjoys <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, without the fellowship of the body, its <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is at rest in that which it has, in such a way, that it would still wish the body to attain to its share.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The desire of the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is entirely at rest, as regards the thing desired; since, to wit, it has that which suffices its <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. But it is not wholly at rest, as regards the desirer, since it does not possess that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in every way that it would wish to possess it. Consequently, after the body has been resumed, Happiness increases not in intensity, but in extent.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> The statement made (Gen. ad lit. xii, 35) to the effect that "the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the departed see not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do," is not to be understood as referring to inequality of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>; because even now some <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the Blessed are raised to the higher orders of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, thus seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more clearly than the lower <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. But it refers to inequality of proportion: because the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, even the lowest, have every perfection of Happiness that they ever will have, whereas the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> have not.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether perfection of the body is necessary for happiness?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that perfection of the body is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> perfect Happiness. For perfection of the body is a bodily <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But it has been shown above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>) that Happiness does not consist in bodily goods. Therefore no perfect disposition of the body is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> Happiness.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> Happiness consists in the vision of the Divine Essence, as shown above (Question 3, Article 8). But the body has not part in this operation, as shown above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>). Therefore no disposition of the body is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for Happiness.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the more the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is abstracted from the body, the more perfectly it understands. But Happiness consists in the most perfect operation of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> should be abstracted from the body in every way. Therefore, in no way is a disposition of the body <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for Happiness.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Happiness is the reward of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse17">John 13:17</a>): "You shall be blessed, if you do them." But the reward promised to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> is not only that they shall see and enjoy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but also that their bodies shall be well-disposed; for it is written (<a href="../bible/isa066.htm#verse14">Isaiah 66:14</a>): "You shall see and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like a herb." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> disposition of the body is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for Happiness.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> If we speak of that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can acquire in this life, it is evident that a well-disposed body is of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> required for it. For this <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. i, 13) in "an operation according to perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>"; and it is clear that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can be hindered, by indisposition of the body, from every operation of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p>But speaking of perfect Happiness, some have maintained that no disposition of body is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for Happiness; indeed, that it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be entirely separated from the body. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei xxii, 26) quotes the words of Porphyry who said that "for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, it must be severed from everything corporeal." But this is unreasonable. For since it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be united to the body; it is not possible for the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to exclude its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> perfection.

<p>Consequently, we must say that perfect disposition of the body is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, both antecedently and consequently, for that Happiness which is in all ways perfect. Antecedently, because, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 35), "if body be such, that the governance thereof is difficult and burdensome, like unto flesh which is corruptible and weighs upon the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is turned away from that vision of the highest <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>." Whence he concludes that, "when this body will no longer be '<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>,' but '<a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>,' then will it be equalled to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and that will be its <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, which erstwhile was its burden." Consequently, because from the Happiness of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> there will be an overflow on to the body, so that this too will obtain its perfection. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. ad Dioscor.) that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> such a powerful <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that from its exceeding fulness of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> the vigor of incorruption overflows into the lower <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Happiness does not consist in bodily <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as its object: but bodily <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> can add a certain charm and perfection to Happiness.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although the body has not part in that operation of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> whereby the Essence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is seen, yet it might <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> a hindrance thereto. Consequently, perfection of the body is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, lest it hinder the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> from being lifted up.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The perfect operation of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> requires indeed that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> be abstracted from this corruptible body which weighs upon the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; but not from the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> body, which will be wholly subject to the spirit. On this point we shall treat in the Third Part of this work (II-II, 82, seqq.).

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether any external goods are necessary for happiness?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that external goods also are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for Happiness. For that which is promised the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> for reward, belongs to Happiness. But external goods are promised the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; for instance, food and drink, <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> and a kingdom: for it is said (<a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse30">Luke 22:30</a>): "That you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom": and (<a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse20">Matthew 6:20</a>): "Lay up to yourselves treasures in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>": and (<a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse34">Matthew 25:34</a>): "Come, ye blessed of My Father, possess you the kingdom." Therefore external goods are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for Happiness.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> (De Consol. iii): <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is "a state made perfect by the aggregate of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things." But some of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> goods are external, although they be of least account, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Lib. Arb. ii, 19). Therefore they too are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for Happiness.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse12">Matthew 5:12</a>): "Your reward is very great in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>." But to be in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> implies being in a place. Therefore at least external place is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for Happiness.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa072.htm#verse25">Psalm 72:25</a>): "For what have I in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>? and besides Thee what do I desire upon earth?" As though to say: "I desire nothing but this,"--"It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for me to adhere to my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore nothing further external is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for Happiness.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> For imperfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, such as can be had in this life, external goods are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, not as belonging to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, but by serving as instruments to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, which consists in an operation of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated in Ethic. i, 13. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs in this life, the necessaries of the body, both for the operation of contemplative <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and for the operation of active <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, for which latter he needs also many other things by means of which to perform its operations.

<p>On the other hand, such goods as these are nowise <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for perfect Happiness, which consists in seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The reason of this is that all suchlike external goods are requisite either for the support of the animal body; or for certain operations which belong to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, which we perform by means of the animal body: whereas that perfect Happiness which consists in seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, will be either in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> separated from the body, or in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> united to the body then no longer animal but <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>. Consequently these external goods are nowise <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for that Happiness, since they are ordained to the animal life. And since, in this life, the felicity of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, as being more Godlike, approaches nearer than that of action to the likeness of that perfect Happiness, therefore it stands in less need of these goods of the body as stated in Ethic. x, 8.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> All those material promises contained in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Scripture</a>, are to be understood metaphorically, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> is wont to express <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things under the form of things corporeal, in order "that from things we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, we may rise to the desire of things unknown," as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xi in Evang.). Thus food and drink signify the delight of Happiness; <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, the sufficiency of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; the kingdom, the lifting up of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to union of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> These goods that serve for the animal life, are incompatible with that <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life wherein perfect Happiness consists. Nevertheless in that Happiness there will be the aggregate of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, because whatever <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> there be in these things, we shall possess it all in the Supreme Fount of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 5), it is not material <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> that is described as the reward of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, but a <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> raised on the height of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods. Nevertheless a bodily place, viz. the empyrean <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, will be appointed to the Blessed, not as a need of Happiness, but by reason of a certain fitness and adornment.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether the fellowship of friend is necessary for happiness?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that friends are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for Happiness. For future Happiness is frequently designated by <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> under the name of "<a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>." But <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> consists in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> being brought to the notice of many. Therefore the fellowship of friends is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for Happiness.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> [Seneca, Ep. 6 says that "there is no delight in possessing any <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> whatever, without someone to share it with us." But delight is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for Happiness. Therefore fellowship of friends is also <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is perfected in Happiness. But <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> includes the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of our neighbor. Therefore it seems that fellowship of friends is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for Happiness.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/wis007.htm#verse11">Wisdom 7:11</a>): "All <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things came to me together with her," i.e. with divine wisdom, which consists in contemplating <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Consequently nothing else is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for Happiness.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> If we speak of the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of this life, the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs friends, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ix, 9), not, indeed, to make use of them, since he suffices himself; nor to delight in them, since he possesses perfect delight in the operation of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; but for the purpose of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> operation, viz. that he may do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to them; that he may delight in seeing them do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and again that he may be helped by them in his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work. For in order that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may do well, whether in the works of the active life, or in those of the contemplative life, he needs the fellowship of friends.

<p>But if we speak of perfect Happiness which will be in our heavenly Fatherland, the fellowship of friends is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to Happiness; since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has the entire fulness of his perfection in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But the fellowship of friends conduces to the well-being of Happiness. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. viii, 25) that "the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> creatures receive no other interior aid to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> than the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a>. But if they can be said to be helped from without, perhaps it is only by this that they see one another and rejoice in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, at their fellowship."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> That <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to Happiness, is that which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has, not with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> but with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This saying is to be understood of the possession of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that does not fully satisfy. This does not apply to the question under consideration; because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> possesses in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> a sufficiency of every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Perfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to Happiness, as to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but not as to the love of our neighbor. Wherefore if there were but one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> enjoying <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it would be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, though having no neighbor to love. But supposing one neighbor to be there, love of him results from perfect love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Consequently, friendship is, as it were, concomitant with perfect Happiness.
