<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether it was fitting that Christ should die?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it was not fitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should die. For a first principle in any order is not affected by anything contrary to such order: thus fire, which is the principle of heat, can never become cold. But the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is the fountain-head and principle of all life, according to <a href="../bible/psa035.htm#verse10">Psalm 35:10</a>: "With Thee is the fountain of life." Therefore it does not seem fitting for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to die.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, death is a greater defect than sickness, because it is through sickness that one comes to die. But it was not beseeming for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to languish from sickness, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> [<a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, Orat. de Incarn. Verbi] says. Consequently, neither was it becoming for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to die.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse10">John 10:10</a>): "I am come that they may have life, and may have it more abundantly." But one opposite does not lead to another. Therefore it seems that neither was it fitting for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to die.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written, (<a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse50">John 11:50</a>): "It is expedient that one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should die for the people . . . that the whole nation perish not": which words were spoken <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a> by Caiphas, as the Evangelist testifies.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It was fitting for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to die. First of all to satisfy for the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, which was sentenced to die on account of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse17">Genesis 2:17</a>: "In what day soever ye shall [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'thou shalt'] eat of it ye shall [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'thou shalt'] die the death." Now it is a fitting way of satisfying for another to submit oneself to the penalty deserved by that other. And so <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> resolved to die, that by dying He might <a href="../cathen/02055a.htm">atone</a> for us, according to <a href="../bible/1pe003.htm#verse18">1 Peter 3:18</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> also died once for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." Secondly, in order to show the reality of the flesh assumed. For, as <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> says (Orat. de Laud. Constant. xv), "if, after dwelling among men <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> were suddenly to disappear from men's sight, as though shunning death, then by all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> He would be likened to a phantom." Thirdly, that by dying He might deliver us from fearing death: hence it is written (<a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse14">Hebrews 2:14-15</a>) that He communicated "to flesh and blood, that through death He might destroy him who had the empire of death and might deliver them who, through the fear of death, were all their lifetime subject to servitude." Fourthly, that by dying in the body to the likeness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>--that is, to its penalty--He might set us the example of dying to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> spiritually. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse10">Romans 6:10</a>): "For in that He died to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, He died once, but in that He liveth, He liveth unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: so do you also reckon that you are dead to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but alive unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Fifthly, that by rising from the dead, and manifesting His power whereby He overthrew death, He might instill into us the hope of rising from the dead. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 15:12</a>): "If <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> be preached that He rose again from the dead, how do some among you say, that there is no <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection from the dead</a>?"

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the fountain of life, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: but He died as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and not as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [Vigilius Tapsensis] says against Felician: "Far be it from us to suppose that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> so felt death that He lost His life inasmuch as He is life in Himself; for, were it so, the fountain of life would have run dry. Accordingly, He experienced death by sharing in our <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> feeling, which of His own accord He had taken upon Himself, but He did not lose the power of His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, through which He gives life to all things."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not suffer death which comes of sickness, lest He should seem to die of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> from exhausted <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: but He endured death inflicted from without, to which He willingly surrendered Himself, that His death might be shown to be a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> one.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> One opposite does not of itself lead to the other, yet it does so indirectly at times: thus cold sometimes is the indirect <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of heat: and in this way <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by His death brought us back to life, when by His death He destroyed our death; just as he who bears another's punishment takes such punishment away.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the Godhead was separated from the flesh when Christ died?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the Godhead was separated from the flesh when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> died. For as Matthew relates (27:46), when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> was hanging upon the cross He cried out: "My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, why hast Thou forsaken Me?" which words <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a>, <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse46">Luke 23:46</a>, explains as follows: "The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cried out when about to expire by being severed from the Godhead; for since the Godhead is immune from death, assuredly death could not be there, except life departed, for the Godhead is life." And so it seems that when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> died, the Godhead was separated from His flesh.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, extremes are severed when the mean is removed. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was the mean through which the Godhead was united with the flesh, as stated above (Question 6, Article 1). Therefore since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was severed from the flesh by death, it seems that, in consequence, His Godhead was also separated from it.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> life-giving power is greater than that of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But the body could not die unless the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> quitted it. Therefore, much less could it die unless the Godhead departed.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> As stated above (16, 4,5), the attributes of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> are predicated of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> only by reason of the union. But what belongs to the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> after death is predicated of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>--namely, being buried: as is evident from the Creed, in which it is said that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> "was conceived and born of a <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin</a>, suffered, died, and was buried." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Godhead was not separated from the flesh when He died.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> What is bestowed through <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is never withdrawn except through fault. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse29">Romans 11:29</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> and the calling of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are without repentance." But the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of union whereby the Godhead was united to the flesh in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Person, is greater than the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of adoption whereby others are sanctified: also it is more enduring of itself, because this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is ordained for personal union, whereas the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of adoption is referred to a certain affective union. And yet we see that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of adoption is never lost without fault. Since, then there was no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, it was impossible for the union of the Godhead with the flesh to be dissolved. Consequently, as before death <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh was united personally and hypostatically with the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, it remained so after His death, so that the hypostasis of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> was not different from that of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh after death, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Such forsaking is not to be referred to the dissolving of the personal union, but to this, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father gave Him up to the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>: hence there "to forsake" means simply not to protect from persecutors. or else He says there that He is forsaken, with reference to the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> He had made: "Father, if it be possible, let this <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> pass away from Me," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> explains it (De Gratia Novi Test.).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is said to be united with the flesh through the medium of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, inasmuch as it is through the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that the flesh belongs to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> intended to assume; but not as though the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> were the medium linking them together. But it is due to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that the flesh is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> even after the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has been separated from it--namely, inasmuch as by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> ordinance there remains in the dead flesh a certain relation to the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>. And therefore the union of the Godhead with the flesh is not taken away.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> formally possesses the life-giving energy, and therefore, while it is present, and united formally, the body must <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> be a living one, whereas the Godhead has not the life-giving energy formally, but effectively; because It cannot be the form of the body: and therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the flesh to be living while the union of the Godhead with the flesh remains, since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not act of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, but of His own will.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether in Christ's death there was a severance between His Godhead and His soul?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there was a severance in death between <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Godhead and His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse18">John 10:18</a>): "No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> taketh away My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from Me: but I lay it down of Myself, and I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it up again." But it does not appear that the body can set the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> aside, by separating the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from itself, because the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not subject to the power of the body, but rather conversely: and so it appears that it belongs to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, to lay down His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: but this is to separate it from Himself. Consequently, by death His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was severed from the Godhead.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> [Vigilius Tapsensis, De Trin. vi; Bardenhewer assigns it to <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a>: 45, iii. The full title is De Trinitate et Spiritu Sancto] says that he "is <a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">accursed</a> who does not confess that the entire <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, whom the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> took to Himself, after being assumed once more or delivered by Him, rose again from the dead on the third day." But the entire <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> could not be assumed again, unless the entire <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was at one time separated from the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>: and the entire <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is made of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body. Therefore there was a separation made at one time of the Godhead from both the body and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> styled a man because of the union with the entire <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. If then, when the union of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with the body was dissolved by death, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> continued united with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, it would follow that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> could be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> called a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, because since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the form of the body, it would result in the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> being the form of the body; which is impossible. Therefore, in death the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was separated from the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body are not one hypostasis, but two. Therefore, if the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> remained united with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, then, when they were severed by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death, it seems to follow that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> was two hypostases during such time as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was dead; which cannot be admitted. Therefore after <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> did not continue to be united with the Word.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii): "Although <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> died as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was separated from His spotless body, nevertheless His Godhead remained unseparated from both--from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, I mean, and from the body."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united with the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> more immediately and more primarily than the body is, because it is through the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that the body is united with the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, as stated above (Question 6, Article 1). Since, then, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> was not separated from the body at <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death, much less was He separated from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Accordingly, since what regards the body severed from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is affirmed of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>--namely, that "it was buried"--so is it said of Him in the Creed that "He descended into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>," because His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> when separated from the body did go down into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Tract. xlvii in Joan.), in commenting on the text of John, asks, since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is Word and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, "whether He putteth down His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, for that He is the Word? Or, for that He is a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>?" Or, again, "for that He is flesh?" And he says that, "should we say that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> laid down His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>" . . . it would follow that "there was a time when that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was severed from the Word"--which is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>. "For death severed the body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> . . . but that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was severed from the Word I do not affirm . . . But should we say that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> laid itself down," it follows "that it is severed from itself: which is most absurd." It remains, therefore, that "the flesh itself layeth down its <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and taketh it again, not by its own power, but by the power of the Word dwelling in the flesh": because, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), the Godhead of the Word was not severed from the flesh in death.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In those words <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> never meant to say that the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was reassumed--that is, as to all his parts--as if the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> had laid aside the parts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> by His death; but that the totality of the assumed <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was restored once more in the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> by the resumed union of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Through being united to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is not on that account called <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: but He is called a man--that is, one having <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the body are <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> parts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence it does not follow that the Word is a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> or a body through being united with both, but that He is one possessing a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> or a body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii): "In <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was separated from the flesh: not one hypostasis divided into two: because both <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body in the same respect had their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> from the beginning in the hypostasis of the Word; and in death, though severed from one another, each one continued to have the one same hypostasis of the Word. Wherefore the one hypostasis of the Word was the hypostasis of the Word, of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and of the body. For neither <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> nor body ever had an hypostasis of its own, besides the hypostasis of the Word: for there was always one hypostasis of the Word, and never two."

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether Christ was a man during the three days of His death?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was a man during the three days of His death, because <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. ii.): "Such was the assuming [of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>] as to make <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." But this assuming [of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>] did not cease at <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death. Therefore it seems that He did not cease to be a man in consequence of death.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ix) that "each <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>"; consequently, when we address the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of Peter after his death we say: "Saint Peter, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us." But the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> after death was not separated from His <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore, during those three days the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was a man.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is a man. But during those three days of death <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>: otherwise what is said in <a href="../bible/psa109.htm#verse4">Psalm 109:4</a> would not be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: "Thou art a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> for ever." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was a man during those three days.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> When the higher [<a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>] is removed, so is the lower. But the living or animated being is a higher <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> than animal and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, because an animal is a sensible animated <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Now during those three days of death <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was not living or animated. Therefore He was not a man.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is an <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">article of faith</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> dead: hence it is an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> against <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to assert anything whereby the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death is destroyed. Accordingly it is said in the Synodal epistle of Cyril [Act. Conc. Ephes. P. I, cap. xxvi]: "If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not acknowledge that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> suffered in the flesh, and was crucified in the flesh and tasted death in the flesh, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>." Now it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the death of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> or animal that by death the subject ceases to be <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> or animal; because the death of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> or animal results from the separation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is the formal complement of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> or animal. Consequently, to say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was a man during the three days of His death simply and without qualification, is <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>. Yet it can be said that He was "a dead <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" during those three days.

<p>However, some writers have contended that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was a man during those three days, uttering words which are indeed <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>, yet without intent of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: as <a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugh of Saint Victor</a>, who (De Sacram. ii) contended that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, during the three days that followed His death, was a man, because he held that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a man: but this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, as was shown in I, 75, 4. Likewise the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master of the Sentences</a> (iii, D, 22) held <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be a man during the three days of His death for quite another reason. For he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the union of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and flesh not to be <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to a man, and that for anything to be a man it suffices if it have a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, whether united or separated: and that this is likewise <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> is clear both from what has been said in I, 75, 4, and from what has been said above regarding the mode of union (2, 5).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> assumed a united <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body: and the result of this assumption was that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But this assumption did not cease by the separation of the Word from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> or from the flesh; yet the union of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and flesh ceased.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> is said to be his own <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, not because the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the entire <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but because the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the chief part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> whole disposition lies virtually; just as the ruler of the city may be called the whole city, since its entire disposal is vested in him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> That a man is competent to be a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is by reason of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is the subject of the character of order: hence a man does not lose his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> order by death, and much less does <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who is the fount of the entire <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether Christ's was identically the same body living and dead?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> was not identically the same body living and dead. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> died just as other men do. But the body of everyone else is not simply identically the same, dead and living, because there is an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> difference between them. Therefore neither is the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> identically the same, dead and living.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. v, text. 12), things specifically diverse are also numerically diverse. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, living and dead, was specifically diverse: because the eye or flesh of the dead is only called so equivocally, as is evident from the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Anima ii, text. 9; Metaph. vii). Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was not simply identically the same, living and dead.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, death is a kind of corruption. But what is corrupted by <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> corruption after being corrupted, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> no longer, since corruption is change from being to non-being. Therefore, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, after it was dead, did not remain identically the same, because death is a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> corruption.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> says (Epist. ad Epict.): "In that body which was <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> and carried, which ate, and toiled, and was nailed on the tree, there was the impassible and incorporeal <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>: the same was laid in the tomb." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> living body was <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> and nailed on the tree; and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> dead body was laid in the tomb. Therefore it was the same body living and dead.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The expression "simply" can be taken in two senses. In the first instance by taking "simply" to be the same as "absolutely"; thus "that is said simply which is said without addition," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> put it (Topic. ii): and in this way the dead and living body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was simply identically the same: since a thing is said to be "simply" identically the same from the identity of the subject. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body living and dead was identical in its suppositum because alive and dead it had none other besides the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, as was stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). And it is in this sense that <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> is speaking in the passage quoted.

<p>In another way "simply" is the same as "altogether" or "totally": in which sense the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, dead and alive, was not "simply" the same identically, because it was not "totally" the same, since life is of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of a living body; for it is an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> and not an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> predicate: hence it follows that a body which ceases to be living does not remain totally the same. Moreover, if it were to be said that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> dead body did continue "totally" the same, it would follow that it was not corrupted--I mean, by the corruption of death: which is the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the Gaianites, as <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. viii), and is to be found in the Decretals (xxiv, qu. iii). And <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii) that "the term 'corruption' denotes two things: in one way it is the separation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the body and other things of the sort; in another way, the complete dissolving into elements. Consequently it is impious to say with Julian and Gaian that the Lord's body was incorruptible after the first manner of corruption before the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>: because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body would not be consubstantial with us, nor <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> dead, nor would we have been saved in very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But in the second way <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was incorrupt."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The dead body of everyone else does not continue united to an abiding hypostasis, as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> dead body did; consequently the dead body of everyone else is not the same "simply," but only in some respect: because it is the same as to its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but not the same as to its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body remains the same simply, on account of the identity of the suppositum, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Since a thing is said to be the same identically according to suppositum, but the same specifically according to form: wherever the suppositum subsists in only one <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it follows of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> that when the unity of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is taken away the unity of identity is also taken away. But the hypostasis of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> subsists in two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>; and consequently, although in others the body does not remain the same according to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, still it continues identically the same in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> according to the suppositum of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Corruption and death do not belong to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by reason of the suppositum, from which suppositum follows the unity of identity; but by reason of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, according to which is found the difference of death and of life in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether Christ's death conduced in any way to our salvation?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death did not conduce in any way to our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For death is a sort of privation, since it is the privation of life. But privation has not any power of activity, because it is nothing positive. Therefore it could not work anything for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> wrought our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by way of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death could not operate in this way, because in death the body is separated from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is the principle of meriting. Consequently, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death did not accomplish anything towards our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, what is corporeal is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of what is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death was corporeal. Therefore it could not be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, which is something <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iv): "The one death of our Saviour," namely, that of the body, "saved us from our two deaths," that is, of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the body.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We may speak of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death in two ways, "in becoming" and "in fact." Death is said to be "in becoming" when anyone from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> or enforced suffering is tending towards death: and in this way it is the same thing to speak of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death as of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>: so that in this sense <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, according to what has been already said of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> (48). But death is considered in fact, inasmuch as the separation of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body has already taken place: and it is in this sense that we are now speaking of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death. In this way <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death cannot be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by way of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, but only by way of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>, that is to say, inasmuch as the Godhead was not separated from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh by death; and therefore, whatever befell <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh, even when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was departed, was conducive to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in virtue of the Godhead united. But the effect of any <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is properly estimated according to its resemblance to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Consequently, since death is a kind of privation of one's own life, the effect of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death is considered in relation to the removal of the obstacles to our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: and these are the death of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and of the body. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death is said to have destroyed in us both the death of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse25">Romans 4:25</a>: "He was delivered up [namely unto death] for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>": and the death of the body, consisting in the separation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse54">1 Corinthians 15:54</a>: "Death is swallowed up in victory."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death wrought our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> from the power of the Godhead united, and not consisted merely as His death.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Though <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death, considered "in fact" did not effect our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by way of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, yet it did so by way of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death was indeed corporeal; but the body was the instrument of the Godhead united to Him, working by Its power, although dead.
