<h1>Question 50. The impediments of marriage, in general</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5050.htm#article1">[One Article]</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether it is fitting that impediments should be assigned to marriage?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem unfitting for <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> to be assigned to marriage. For marriage is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> condivided with the others. But no <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> are assigned to the others. Neither therefore should they be assigned to marriage.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the less perfect a thing is the fewer its obstacles. Now <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> is the least perfect of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Therefore it should have either no <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> or very few.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, wherever there is disease, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to have a remedy for the disease. Now <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, a remedy for which is permitted in <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse6">1 Corinthians 7:6</a>), is in all. Therefore there should not be any impediment making it altogether unlawful for a particular <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to marry.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, unlawful means against the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Now these <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> that are assigned to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> are not against the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, because they are not found to be the same in each state of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, since more degrees of kindred come under prohibition at one time than at another. Nor, seemingly, can <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> set <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> against marriage, since marriage, like the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, is not of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> but of Divine institution. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> should not be assigned to marriage, making it unlawful for a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to marry.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, lawful and unlawful differ as that which is against the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> from that which is not, and between these there is no middle term, since they are opposed according to affirmation and negation. Therefore there cannot be <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> to marriage, placing a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in a middle position between those who are lawful and those who are unlawful subjects of marriage.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, union of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is unlawful save in marriage. Now every unlawful union should be dissolved. Therefore if anything prevent a marriage being contracted, it will "de facto" dissolve it after it has been contracted; and thus <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> should not be assigned to marriage, which hinder it from being contracted, and dissolve it after it has been contracted.

<p><strong>Objection 7.</strong> Further, no impediment can remove from a thing that which is part of its definition. Now indissolubility is part of the definition of marriage. Therefore there cannot be any <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> which annul a marriage already contracted.

<p><strong>Objection 8.</strong> On the other hand, it would seem that there should be an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> to marriage. For marriage is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> may be lacking in an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of ways, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iii). Therefore there is an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> to marriage.

<p><strong>Objection 9.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> to marriage arise from the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>. But such like <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in number. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> to marriage are also <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In marriage, as in other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, there are certain things <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to marriage, and others that belong to its solemnization. And since even without the things that pertain to its solemnization it is still a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sacrament, as also in the case of the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, it follows that the <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> to those things that pertain to the solemnization of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> do not derogate from the validity of the marriage. These <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> are said to hinder the contracting of marriage, but they do not dissolve the marriage once contracted; such are the veto of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> seasons. Hence the verse: <blockquote> "The veto of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> tide<br> Forbid the knot, but loose it not if tied."<br> </blockquote>

<p>On the other hand, those <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> which regard the essentials of marriage make a marriage invalid, wherefore they are said not only to hinder the contracting of marriage, but to dissolve it if contracted; and they are contained in the following verse: <blockquote> "<a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">Error</a>, station, <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, kinship, crime,<br> Difference of worship, force, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> orders,<br> Marriage bond, honesty, affinity, impotence,<br> All these forbid marriage, and annul it though contracted."<br> </blockquote>

<p>The reason for this number may be explained as follows: Marriage may be hindered either on the part of the contract or in regard to the contracting parties. If in the first way, since the marriage contract is made by <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> consent, and this is incompatible with either <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, there will be two <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> to marriage, namely "force," i.e. compulsion, and "<a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>" in reference to <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> pronounced on these two <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> when treating of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> (Sent. iv, DD 29,30). Here, however, he is treating of the <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> as arising from the contracting parties, and these may be differentiated as follows. A <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> may be hindered from contracting marriage either simply, or with some particular <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. If simply, so that he be unable to contract marriage with any <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, this can only be because he is hindered from performing the marriage act. This happens in two ways. First, because he cannot "de facto," either through being altogether unable--and thus we have the impediment of "impotence"--or through being unable to do so freely, and thus we have the impediment of the "<a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of slavery." Secondly, because he cannot do it lawfully, and this because he is bound to <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, which happens in two ways, either through his being bound on account of the office he has undertaken to fulfill--and thus we have the impediment of "Order"--or on account of his having taken a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>--and thus "Vow" is an impediment.

<p>If, however, a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is hindered from marrying, not simply but in reference to a particular <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, this is either because he is bound to another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and thus he who is <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> to one cannot marry another, which constitutes the impediment of the "bond of marriage"--or through lack of proportion to the other party, and this for three reasons. First, on account of too great a distance separating them, and thus we have "difference of worship"; secondly, on account of their being too closely related, and thus we have three <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a>, namely "kinship," then "affinity," which denotes the close relationship between two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, in reference to a third united to one of them by marriage, and the "<a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of public honesty," where we have a close relationship between two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> arising out of the <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothal</a> of one of them to a third <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; thirdly, on account of a previous undue union between him and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and thus the "crime of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>" previously committed with her is an impediment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> There may be <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> to the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> also in the omission either of that which is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a>, or of that which pertains to the solemnization of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as stated above. However, <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> are assigned to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> rather than to the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> for three reasons. First, because <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> consists of two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and consequently can be impeded in more ways than the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which refer to one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> taken individually; secondly, because <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> has its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> in us and in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while some of the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> have their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. Wherefore penance which in a manner has a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> in us, is assigned certain <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> by the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> (Sent. iv, D, 16), such as hypocrisy, the public games, and so forth; thirdly, because other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are objects of command or counsel, as being more perfect goods, whereas marriage is a matter of <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>, as being a less perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse6">1 Corinthians 7:6</a>). Wherefore, in order to afford an opportunity of proficiency towards a greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, more <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> are assigned to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> than to the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The more perfect things can be hindered in more ways, in so far as more <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> are required for them. And if an imperfect thing requires more <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>, there will be more <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> to it; and thus it is in <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument would hold, were there no other and more efficacious remedies for the disease of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>; which is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Persons are said to be unlawful subjects for marriage through being contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> whereby marriage is established. Now marriage as fulfilling an office of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is established by the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>; as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>; as fulfilling an office of society, by the <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>. Consequently a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> may be rendered an unlawful subject of marriage by any of the aforesaid laws. Nor does the comparison with the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> hold, for they are <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> only. And since the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> is particularized in various ways according to the various states of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, and since positive <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, too, varies according to the various <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> (Sent. iv, D, 34) asserts that at various times various <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> have been unlawful subjects of marriage.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> may forbid a thing either altogether, or in part and in certain cases. Hence between that which is altogether according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and that which is altogether against the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> (which are opposed by contrariety and not according to affirmation and negation), that which is somewhat according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and somewhat against the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is a middle term. For this reason certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> hold a middle place between those who are simply lawful subjects and those who are simply unlawful.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> Those <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> which do not annul a marriage already contracted sometimes hinder a marriage from being contracted, by rendering it not invalid but unlawful. And if it be contracted it is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> marriage although the contracting parties <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; just as by <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> after breaking one's fast one would <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by disobeying the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> ordinance, and yet it would be a valid sacrament because it is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the sacrament that the consecrator be <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 7.</strong> When we say that the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> annul marriage already contracted, we do not mean that they dissolve a marriage contracted in due form, but that they dissolve a marriage contracted "de facto" and not "de jure." Wherefore if an impediment supervene after a marriage has been contracted in due form, it cannot dissolve the marriage.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 8.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> that hinder a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in number, like all <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> which of their own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> corrupt a certain <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> are directed to that effect, and determinate, even as are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> which produce that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; for the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> by which a thing is destroyed and those by which it is made are either contrary to one another, or the same but taken in a contrary way.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 9.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of particular <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> taken individually are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in number, but taken in general, they may be reduced to a certain number; as instanced in medicine and all operative arts, which consider the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of particular <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in whom acts are.
