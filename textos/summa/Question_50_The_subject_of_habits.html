<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether there is a habit in the body?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is not a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> in the body. For, as the <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Commentator</a> says (De Anima iii), "a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is that whereby we act when we will." But bodily actions are not subject to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, since they are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>. Therefore there can be no <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> in the body.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, all bodily dispositions are easy to change. But <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, difficult to change. Therefore no bodily disposition can be a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, all bodily dispositions are subject to change. But change can only be in the third <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, which is divided against <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. Therefore there is no <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> in the body.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says in the Book of Predicaments (De Categor. vi) that health of the body and incurable disease are called <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As we have said above (49, A2 seqq.), <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is a disposition of a subject which is in a state of <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> either to form or to operation. Therefore in so far as <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> implies disposition to operation, no <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is principally in the body as its subject. For every operation of the body proceeds either from a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of the body or from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> moving the body. Consequently, as to those operations which proceed from its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the body is not disposed by a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>: because the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> forces are determined to one mode of operation; and we have already said (49, 4) that it is when the subject is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to many things that a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> disposition is required. As to the operations which proceed from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> through the body, they belong principally to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and secondarily to the body. Now <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are in proportion to their operations: whence "by like acts like <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are formed" (Ethic. ii, 1,2). And therefore the dispositions to such operations are principally in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But they can be secondarily in the body: to wit, in so far as the body is disposed and enabled with promptitude to help in the operations of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p>If, however, we speak of the disposition of the subject to form, thus a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> disposition can be in the body, which is related to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as a subject is to its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. And in this way health and beauty and such like are called <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> dispositions. Yet they have not the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> perfectly: because their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, of their very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, are easily changeable.

<p>On the other hand, as Simplicius reports in his Commentary on the Predicaments, Alexander denied absolutely that <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> or dispositions of the first <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are in the body: and held that the first <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> belonged to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> alone. And he held that <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> mentions health and sickness in the Book on the Predicaments not as though they belonged to the first <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, but by way of example: so that he would mean that just as health and sickness may be easy or difficult to change, so also are all the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> of the first <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, which are called <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> and dispositions. But this is clearly contrary to the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>: both because he speaks in the same way of health and sickness as examples, as of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and science; and because in Phys. vii, text. 17, he expressly mentions beauty and health among <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This objection runs in the sense of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> as a disposition to operation, and of those actions of the body which are from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: but not in the sense of those actions which proceed from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and the principle of which is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Bodily dispositions are not simply difficult to change on account of the changeableness of their bodily <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. But they may be difficult to change by comparison to such a subject, because, to wit, as long as such a subject endures, they cannot be removed; or because they are difficult to change, by comparison to other dispositions. But <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are simply difficult to change, on account of the unchangeableness of the subject. And therefore he does not say that health which is difficult to change is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> simply: but that it is "as a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>," as we read in the Greek [<em>isos hexin</em> (Categor. viii)]. On the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are called <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> simply.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Bodily dispositions which are in the first <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, as some maintained, differ from <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> of the third <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, in this, that the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> of the third <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> consist in some "becoming" and movement, as it were, wherefore they are called <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> or passible <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>. But when they have attained to perfection (specific perfection, so to speak), they have then passed into the first <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>. But Simplicius in his Commentary disapproves of this; for in this way heating would be in the third <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and heat in the first <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>; whereas <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> puts heat in the third.

<p>Wherefore Porphyrius, as Simplicius reports (Commentary), says that passion or passion-like <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, disposition and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, differ in bodies by way of intensity and remissness. For when a thing receives heat in this only that it is being heated, and not so as to be able to give heat, then we have passion, if it is transitory; or passion-like <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> if it is permanent. But when it has been brought to the point that it is able to heat something else, then it is a disposition; and if it goes so far as to be firmly fixed and to become difficult to change, then it will be a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>: so that disposition would be a certain intensity of passion or passion-like <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> an intensity or disposition. But Simplicius disapproves of this, for such intensity and remissness do not imply diversity on the part of the form itself, but on the part of the diverse participation thereof by the subject; so that there would be no diversity among the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>. And therefore we must say otherwise that, as was explained above (49, 2, ad 1), the adjustment of the passion-like <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> themselves, according to their suitability to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, implies the notion of disposition: and so, when a change takes place in these same passion-like <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>, which are heat and cold, moisture and dryness, there results a change as to sickness and health. But change does not occur in regard to like <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> and dispositions, primarily and of themselves.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the soul is the subject of habit in respect of its essence or in respect of its power?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in respect of its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> rather than in respect of its powers. For we speak of dispositions and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> in relation to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as stated above (Question 49, Article 2). But <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> regards the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> rather than the powers; because it is in respect of its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of such a body and the form thereof. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in respect of its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and not in respect of its powers.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> is not the subject of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>. But the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are in the genus of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, as we have said in the I, 77, 1, ad 5. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is not in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in respect of its powers.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the subject is prior to that which is in the subject. But since <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> belongs to the first <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, it is prior to power, which belongs to the second <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is not in a power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as its subject.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. i, 13) puts various <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> in the various powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As we have said above (49, A2,3), <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> implies a certain disposition in relation to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or to operation. If therefore we take <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> as having a relation to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it cannot be in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>--that is, if we speak of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself is the form completing the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; so that, regarded in this way, <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> or disposition is rather to be found in the body by reason of its relation to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, than in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by reason of its relation to the body. But if we speak of a higher <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, of which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may become a partaker, according to <a href="../bible/2pe001.htm">2 Peter 1</a>, "that we may be partakers of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>": thus nothing hinders some <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, namely, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, from being in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in respect of its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, as we shall state later on (110, 4).

<p>On the other hand, if we take <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> in its relation to operation, it is chiefly thus that <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are found in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: in so far as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not determined to one operation, but is indifferent to many, which is a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> for a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, as we have said above (Question 49, Article 4). And since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the principle of operation through its powers, therefore, regarded in this sense, <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in respect of its powers.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, not as a subject requiring to be disposed to something further, but as a form and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to which someone is disposed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Accident is not of itself the subject of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>. But since among <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> themselves there is a certain order, the subject, according as it is under one <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, is conceived as the subject of a further <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>. In this way we say that one <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> is the subject of another; as superficies is the subject of color, in which sense power is the subject of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Habit takes precedence of power, according as it implies a disposition to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: whereas power always implies a relation to operation, which is posterior, since <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is the principle of operation. But the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> whose subject is a power, does not imply relation to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but to operation. Wherefore it is posterior to power. Or, we may say that <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> takes precedence of power, as the complete takes precedence of the incomplete, and as act takes precedence of <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. For act is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> prior to <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, though <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> is prior in order of generation and time, as stated in Metaph. vii, text. 17; ix, text. 13.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether there can be any habits in the powers of the sensitive parts?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there cannot be any <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> in the powers of the sensitive part. For as the nutritive power is an irrational part, so is the sensitive power. But there can be no <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> in the powers of the nutritive part. Therefore we ought not to put any <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> in the powers of the sensitive part.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the sensitive parts are common to us and the brutes. But there are not any <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> in brutes: for in them there is no will, which is put in the definition of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, as we have said above (Question 49, Article 3). Therefore there are no <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> in the sensitive powers.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: and just as science is related to the apprehensive power, so it <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> related to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power. But in the sensitive powers there are no <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>: since science is of universals, which the sensitive powers cannot apprehend. Therefore, neither can there be <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in the sensitive part.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 10) that "some <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>," namely, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, "belong to the irrational part."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The sensitive powers can be considered in two ways: first, according as they act from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a>: secondly, according as they act at the command of reason. According as they act from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a>, they are ordained to one thing, even as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is; but according as they act at the command of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, they can be ordained to various things. And thus there can be <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> in them, by which they are well or ill disposed in regard to something.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The powers of the nutritive part have not an inborn aptitude to obey the command of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, and therefore there are no <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> in them. But the sensitive powers have an inborn aptitude to obey the command of reason; and therefore <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> can be in them: for in so far as they obey reason, in a certain sense they are said to be rational, as stated in Ethic. i, 13.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The sensitive powers of dumb animals do not act at the command of reason; but if they are left to themselves, such animals act from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a>: and so in them there are no <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> ordained to operations. There are in them, however, certain dispositions in relation to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as health and beauty. But whereas by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> reason brutes are disposed by a sort of custom to do things in this or that way, so in this sense, to a certain extent, we can admit the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> in dumb animals: wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. lxxxiii, qu. 36): "We find the most untamed beasts, deterred by fear of pain, from that wherein they took the keenest pleasure; and when this has become a custom in them, we say that they are tame and gentle." But the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is incomplete, as to the use of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, for they have not that power of using or of refraining, which seems to belong to the notion of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>: and therefore, properly speaking, there can be no <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> in them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> has an inborn aptitude to be moved by the rational <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, as stated in De Anima iii, text. 57: but the rational powers of apprehension have an inborn aptitude to receive from the sensitive powers. And therefore it is more suitable that <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> should be in the powers of sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> than in the powers of sensitive apprehension, since in the powers of sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> do not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> except according as they act at the command of the reason. And yet even in the interior powers of sensitive apprehension, we may admit of certain <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has a facility of <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, thought or <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>: wherefore also the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Memor. et Remin. ii) that "custom conduces much to a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>": the reason of which is that these powers also are moved to act at the command of the reason.

<p>On the other hand the exterior apprehensive powers, as sight, hearing and the like, are not susceptible of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, but are ordained to their fixed acts, according to the disposition of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, just as the members of the body, for there are no <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> in them, but rather in the powers which command their movements.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether there is any habit in the intellect?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there are no <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. For <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are in conformity with operations, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). But the operations of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> are common to <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, as stated in De Anima i, text. 64. Therefore also are <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not an act of the body (De Anima iii, text. 6). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not the subject of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever is in a thing, is there according to the mode of that in which it is. But that which is form without <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, is act only: whereas what is composed of form and <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, has <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> and act at the same time. Therefore nothing at the same time <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a> and actual can be in that which is form only, but only in that which is composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is form without <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, which has <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> at the same time as act, being a sort of medium between the two, cannot be in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; but only in the "conjunction," which is composed of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is a disposition whereby we are well or ill disposed in regard to something, as is said (Metaph. v, text. 25). But that anyone should be well or ill disposed to an act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is due to some disposition of the body: wherefore also it is stated (De Anima ii, text. 94) that "we observe men with soft flesh to be quick witted." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> are not in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which is separate, but in some power which is the act of some part of the body.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vi, 2,3,10) puts science, wisdom and understanding, which is the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of first principles, in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> concerning <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> there have been various opinions. Some, supposing that there was only one "possible" [I, 79, 2, ad 2] <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, were bound to hold that <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> are not in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> itself, but in the interior sensitive powers. For it is manifest that men differ in <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>; and so it was impossible to put the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> directly in that, which, being only one, would be common to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Wherefore if there were but one single "possible" <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of science, in which men differ from one another, could not be in the "possible" <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> as their subject, but would be in the interior sensitive powers, which differ in various men.

<p>Now, in the first place, this supposition is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>. For it is manifest that the sensitive powers are rational, not by their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, but only by participation (Ethic. i, 13). Now the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> puts the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, which are wisdom, science and understanding, in that which is rational by its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Wherefore they are not in the sensitive powers, but in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> itself. Moreover he says expressly (De Anima iii, text. 8,18) that when the "possible" <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> "is thus identified with each thing," that is, when it is reduced to act in respect of singulars by the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, "then it is said to be in act, as the knower is said to be in act; and this happens when the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can act of itself," i.e. by considering: "and even then it is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> in a sense; but not in the same way as before learning and discovering." Therefore the "possible" <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> itself is the subject of the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of science, by which the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, even though it be not actually considering, is able to consider. In the second place, this supposition is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For as to whom belongs the operation, belongs also the power to operate, belongs also the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. But to understand and to consider is the proper act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore also the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> whereby one considers is properly in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> itself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Some said, as Simplicius reports in his Commentary on the Predicaments, that, since every operation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is to a certain extent an operation of the "conjunctum," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima i, text. 64); therefore no <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> only, but in the "conjunctum." And from this it follows that no <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is separate, as ran the argument, given above. But the argument is no cogent. For <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is not a disposition of the object to the power, but rather a disposition of the power to the object: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> needs to be in that power which is principle of the act, and not in that which is compared to the power as its object.

<p>Now the act of understanding is not said to be common to <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, except in respect of the phantasm, as is stated in De Anima, text. 66. But it is clear that the phantasm is compared as object to the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> (De Anima iii, text. 3,39). Whence it follows that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is chiefly on the part of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> itself; and not on the part of the phantasm, which is common to <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body. And therefore we must say that the "possible" <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the subject of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, which is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to many: and this belongs, above all, to the "possible" <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Wherefore the "possible" <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the subject of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to sensible being belongs to corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, so <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> being belongs to the "possible" <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Wherefore nothing forbids <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> to be in the "possible" <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, for it is midway between pure <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> and perfect act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Because the apprehensive powers inwardly prepare their proper objects for the "possible <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>," therefore it is by the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> disposition of these powers, to which the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> disposition of the body cooperates, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is rendered apt to understand. And so in a secondary way the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> can be in these powers. But principally it is in the "possible" <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether any habit is in the will?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is not a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> which is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, by means of which the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> actually understands. But the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does not act by means of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not the subject of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is allotted to the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as there is to the "possible" <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, because the former is an active power. But the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is above all an active power, because it moves all the powers to their acts, as stated above (Question 9, Article 1). Therefore there is no <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers there is no <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, because, by reason of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, they are determinate to one thing. But the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, by reason of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, is ordained to tend to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which reason directs. Therefore there is no <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Justice is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; for it is "a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> whereby men will and do that which is just" (Ethic. v, 1). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the subject of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Every power which may be variously directed to act, needs a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> whereby it is well disposed to its act. Now since the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is a rational power, it may be variously directed to act. And therefore in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> we must admit the presence of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> whereby it is well disposed to its act. Moreover, from the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, it is clear that it is principally related to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> "is that which one uses when one wills," as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Even as in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> there is a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> which is the likeness of the object; so in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and in every <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power there must be something by which the power is inclined to its object; for the act of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power is nothing but a certain inclination, as we have said above (6, 4; 22, 2). And therefore in respect of those things to which it is inclined sufficiently by the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the power itself, the power needs no <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> to incline it. But since it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, for the end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, that the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power be inclined to something fixed, to which it is not inclined by the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the power, which has a relation to many and various things, therefore it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that, in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and in the other <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> powers, there be certain <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> to incline them, and these are called <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is active only, and in no way passive. But the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and every <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, is both mover and moved (De Anima iii, text. 54). And therefore the comparison between them does not hold; for to be susceptible of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> belongs to that which is somehow in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The will from the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the power inclined to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the reason. But because this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is varied in many ways, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> needs to be inclined, by means of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, to some fixed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the reason, in order that action may follow more promptly.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether there are habits in the angels?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there are no <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For Maximus, commentator of <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Coel. Hier. vii), says: "It is not proper to suppose that there are <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> (i.e. <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>) powers in the divine intelligences (i.e. in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>) after the manner of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, as in us: as though one were in the other as in a subject: for <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> of any kind is foreign to them." But every <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>. Therefore there are no <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. iv): "The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> dispositions of the heavenly <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essences</a> participate, above all other things, in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>." But that which is of itself [per se] is prior to and more power than that which is by another [per aliud]. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essences</a> are perfected of themselves unto conformity with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and therefore not by means of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>. And this seems to have been the reasoning of Maximus, who in the same passage adds: "For if this were the case, surely their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> would not remain in itself, nor could it have been as far as possible deified of itself."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is a disposition (Metaph. v, text. 25). But disposition, as is said in the same book, is "the order of that which has parts." Since, therefore, <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are simple <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, it seems that there are no dispositions and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> in them.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. vii) that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are of the first <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> are called: "Fire-bearers and Thrones and Outpouring of Wisdom, by which is indicated the godlike <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of their <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some have thought that there are no <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and that whatever is said of them, is said <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>. Whence Maximus, after the words which we have quoted, says: "Their dispositions, and the powers which are in them, are <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a>, through the absence of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in them." And Simplicius says the same in his Commentary on the Predicaments: "Wisdom which is in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is its <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>: but that which is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, is its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. For everything divine is sufficient of itself, and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in itself."

<p>Now this opinion contains some <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and some <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. For it is manifest from what we have said (49, 4) that only a being in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> is the subject of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. So the above-mentioned commentators considered that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, and that there is no material <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> in them, and on that account, excluded from them <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> and any kind of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>. Yet since though there is no material <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> in <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, there is still some <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> in them (for to be <a href="../cathen/01125b.htm">pure act</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone), therefore, as far as <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> is found to be in them, so far may <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> be found in them. But because the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> are not of the same kind. Whence, Simplicius says in his Commentary on the Predicaments that: "The <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> are not like the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> here below, but rather are they like simple and immaterial images which it contains in itself."

<p>However, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> differ with regard to this <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, being the lowest in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> order, is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> as regards all intelligible things, just as primal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is in respect of all sensible forms; and therefore for the understanding of all things, it needs some <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not as a pure <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> in the order of intelligible things, but as an act; not indeed as <a href="../cathen/01125b.htm">pure act</a> (for this belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone), but with an admixture of some <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>: and the higher it is, the less <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> it has. And therefore, as we said in the I, 55, 1, so far as it is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, so far is it in need of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> perfection by means of intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in regard to its proper operation: but so far as it is in act, through its own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> it can understand some things, at least itself, and other things according to the mode of its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, as stated in De Causis: and the more perfect it is, the more perfectly will it understand.

<p>But since no <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> attains to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but all are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> distant therefrom; for this reason, in order to attain to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, through <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> need some <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, being as it were in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> in regard to that <a href="../cathen/01125b.htm">Pure Act</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. vii) that their <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are "<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">godlike</a>," that is to say, that by them they are made like to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>But those <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> that are dispositions to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> being are not in <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, since they are immaterial.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This saying of Maximus must be understood of material <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> and <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As to that which belongs to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> by their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, they do not need a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. But as they are not so far beings of themselves, as not to partake of Divine wisdom and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, therefore, so far as they need to partake of something from without, so far do they need to have <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> there are no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> parts: but there are <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a> parts, in so far as their <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is perfected by several <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and in so far as their will has a relation to several things.
