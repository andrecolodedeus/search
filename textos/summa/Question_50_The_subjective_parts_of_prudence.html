<h1>Question 50. The subjective parts of prudence</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3050.htm#article1"> Is a species of prudence regnative?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3050.htm#article2"> Is political economy a species of prudence?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3050.htm#article3"> Is domestic economy a species of prudence?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3050.htm#article4"> Is military prudence?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether a species of prudence is regnative?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that regnative should not be reckoned a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. For regnative <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is directed to the preservation of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, since according to Ethic. v, 6 the prince is the guardian of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Therefore regnative <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> rather than to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Polit. iii, 5) a kingdom [regnum] is one of six <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of government. But no <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is ascribed to the other five forms of government, which are "aristocracy," "polity," also called "timocracy" [Cf. Ethic. viii, 10, "tyranny," "oligarchy" and "democracy." Therefore neither should a regnative <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> be ascribed to a kingdom.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, lawgiving belongs not only to kings, but also to certain others placed in authority, and even to the people, according to <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> (Etym. v). Now the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vi, 8) reckons a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> to be "legislative." Therefore it is not becoming to substitute regnative <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> in its place.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Polit. iii, 11) that "<a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which is proper to the prince." Therefore a special kind of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is regnative.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (47, 8,10), it belongs to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> to govern and command, so that wherever in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> we find a special kind of governance and command, there must be a special kind of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Now it is evident that there is a special and perfect kind of governance in one who has to govern not only himself but also the perfect community of a city or kingdom; because a government is the more perfect according as it is more universal, extends to more matters, and attains a higher end. Hence <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> in its special and most perfect sense, belongs to a king who is charged with the government of a city or kingdom: for which reason a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is reckoned to be regnative.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> All matters connected with moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> belong to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> as their guide, wherefore "right reason in accord with <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>" is included in the definition of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated above (47, 5, ad 1; I-II, 58, 2, ad 4). For this reason also the execution of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> in so far as it is directed to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is part of the kingly office, needs the guidance of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Hence these two <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>--<a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>--belong most properly to a king, according to <a href="../bible/jer023.htm#verse5">Jeremiah 23:5</a>: "A king shall reign and shall be wise, and shall execute <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and judgment in the earth." Since, however, direction belongs rather to the king, and execution to his subjects, regnative <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is reckoned a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> which is directive, rather than to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> which is executive.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A kingdom is the best of all governments, as stated in Ethic. viii, 10: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> should be denominated rather from a kingdom, yet so as to comprehend under regnative all other rightful forms of government, but not perverse forms which are opposed to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and which, accordingly, do not pertain to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> names regnative <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> after the principal act of a king which is to make laws, and although this applies to the other forms of government, this is only in so far as they have a share of kingly government.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether political prudence is fittingly accounted a part of prudence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that political <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is not fittingly accounted a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. For regnative is a part of political <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). But a part should not be reckoned a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> with the whole. Therefore political <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> should not be reckoned a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are distinguished by their various objects. Now what the ruler has to command is the same as what the subject has to execute. Therefore political <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> as regards the subjects, should not be reckoned a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> distinct from regnative <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, each subject is an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Now each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> can direct himself sufficiently by <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> commonly so called. Therefore there is no need of a special kind of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> called political.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vi, 8) that "of the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> which is concerned with the state one kind is a master-<a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and is called legislative; another kind bears the common name political, and deals with <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> is moved by his master, and a subject by his ruler, by command, but otherwise than as irrational and inanimate beings are set in motion by their movers. For irrational and inanimate beings are moved only by others and do not put themselves in motion, since they have no <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> whereby to be masters of their own actions, wherefore the rectitude of their government is not in their power but in the power of their movers. On the other hand, men who are slaves or subjects in any sense, are moved by the commands of others in such a way that they move themselves by their <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>; wherefore some kind of rectitude of government is required in them, so that they may direct themselves in obeying their superiors; and to this belongs that <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> which is called political.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above, regnative is the most perfect <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, wherefore the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of subjects, which falls short of regnative <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, retains the common name of political <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, even as in <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> a convertible term which does not denote the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of a thing retains the name of "proper."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A different aspect of the object diversifies the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, as stated above (Question 47, Article 5). Now the same actions are considered by the king, but under a more general aspect, as by his subjects who obey: since many obey one king in various departments. Hence regnative <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is compared to this political <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of which we are speaking, as mastercraft to handicraft.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Man directs himself by <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> commonly so called, in relation to his own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but by political <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, of which we speak, he directs himself in relation to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether a part of prudence should be reckoned to be domestic?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that domestic should not be reckoned a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. For, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vi, 5) "<a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is directed to a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> life in general": whereas domestic <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is directed to a particular end, viz. <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, according to Ethic. i, 1. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is not domestic.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as stated above (Question 47, Article 13) <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is only in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> people. But domestic <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> may be also in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> people, since many sinners are provident in governing their household. Therefore domestic <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> should not be reckoned a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as in a kingdom there is a ruler and subject, so also is there in a household. If therefore domestic like political is a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, there should be a paternal corresponding to regnative <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Now there is no such <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Therefore neither should domestic <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> be accounted a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. vi, 8) that there are various kinds of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> in the government of a multitude, "one of which is domestic, another legislative, and another political."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Different aspects of an object, in respect of universality and particularity, or of totality and partiality, diversify arts and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; and in respect of such diversity one act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is principal as compared with another. Now it is evident that a household is a mean between the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> and the city or kingdom, since just as the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> is part of the household, so is the household part of the city or kingdom. And therefore, just as <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> commonly so called which governs the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, is distinct from political <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, so must domestic <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> be distinct from both.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Riches are compared to domestic <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, not as its last end, but as its instrument, as stated in Polit. i, 3. On the other hand, the end of political <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is "a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> life in general" as regards the conduct of the household. On Ethic. i, 1 the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> speaks of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> as the end of political <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, by way of example and in accordance with the opinion of many.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Some sinners may be provident in certain matters of detail concerning the disposition of their household, but not in regard to "a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> life in general" as regards the conduct of the household, for which above all a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> life is required.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The father has in his household an authority like that of a king, as stated in Ethic. viii, 10, but he has not the full power of a king, wherefore paternal government is not reckoned a distinct <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, like regnative <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether military prudence should be reckoned a part of prudence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that military <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> should not be reckoned a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. For <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is distinct from art, according to Ethic. vi, 3. Now military <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> seems to be the art of warfare, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iii, 8). Therefore military <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> should not be accounted a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as military business is contained under political affairs, so too are many other matters, such as those of tradesmen, craftsmen, and so forth. But there are no <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> corresponding to other affairs in the state. Neither therefore should any be assigned to military business.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the soldiers' bravery counts for a great deal in warfare. Therefore military <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> pertains to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> rather than to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/pro024.htm#verse6">Proverbs 24:6</a>): "War is managed by due ordering, and there shall be safety where there are many counsels." Now it belongs to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> to take counsel. Therefore there is great need in warfare for that <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> which is called "military."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Whatever things are done according to art or reason, should be made to conform to those which are in accordance with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and are established by the Divine <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> has a twofold tendency: first, to govern each thing in itself, secondly, to withstand outward assailants and corruptives: and for this reason she has provided animals not only with the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty, whereby they are moved to that which is conducive to their well-being, but also with the irascible power, whereby the animal withstands an assailant. Therefore in those things also which are in accordance with reason, there should be not only "political" <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, which disposes in a suitable manner such things as belong to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but also a "military" <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, whereby hostile attacks are repelled.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Military <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> may be an art, in so far as it has certain rules for the right use of certain external things, such as arms and horses, but in so far as it is directed to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it belongs rather to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Other matters in the state are directed to the profit of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, whereas the business of soldiering is directed to the service belongs to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, but the direction, protection of the entire common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The execution of military service belongs to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, but the direction, especially in so far as it concerns the commander-in-chief, belongs to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.
