<h1>Question 50. The substance of the angels absolutely considered</h1>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether an angel is altogether incorporeal?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is not entirely incorporeal. For what is incorporeal only as regards ourselves, and not in relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is not absolutely incorporeal. But <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii) that "an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is said to be incorporeal and immaterial as regards us; but compared to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> it is corporeal and material. Therefore he is not simply incorporeal."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, nothing is moved except a body, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Phys. vi, text 32). But <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii) that "an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is an ever movable <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>." Therefore an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is a corporeal <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Spir. Sanct. i, 7): "Every creature is limited within its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." But to be limited belongs to bodies. Therefore, every creature is corporeal. Now <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> creatures, as appears from <a href="../bible/psa148.htm#verse2">Psalm 148:2</a>: "Praise ye" the Lord, "all His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>"; and, farther on (<a href="../bible/psa148.htm#verse4">verse 4</a>), "For He spoke, and they were made; He commanded, and they were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are corporeal.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/psa103.htm#verse4">Psalm 103:4</a>): "Who makes His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> spirits."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There must be some incorporeal creatures. For what is principally intended by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in creatures is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and this consists in assimilation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself. And the perfect assimilation of an effect to a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is accomplished when the effect imitates the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> according to that whereby the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> produces the effect; as heat makes heat. Now, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> produces the creature by His <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will (14, 8; 19, 4). Hence the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> requires that there should be <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> creatures. Now <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> cannot be the action of a body, nor of any corporeal faculty; for every body is limited to "here" and "now." Hence the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> requires the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of an incorporeal creature.

<p>The ancients, however, not properly realizing the force of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>, and failing to make a proper distinction between sense and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, thought that nothing <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in the world but what could be apprehended by sense and <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>. And because bodies alone fall under <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, they supposed that no being <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> except bodies, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> observes (Phys. iv, text 52,57). Thence came the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the Sadducees, who said there was no spirit (<a href="../bible/act023.htm#verse8">Acts 23:8</a>).

<p>But the very fact that <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is above sense is a reasonable <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that there are some incorporeal things comprehensible by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> alone.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Incorporeal <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> rank between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and corporeal creatures. Now the medium compared to one extreme appears to be the other extreme, as what is tepid compared to heat seems to be cold; and thus it is said that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, compared to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are material and corporeal, not, however, as if anything corporeal <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Movement is there taken in the sense in which it is applied to <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> and will. Therefore an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is called an ever mobile <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, because he is ever actually <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a>, and not as if he were sometimes actually and sometimes <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a>, as we are. Hence it is clear that the objection rests on an equivocation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> To be circumscribed by local limits belongs to bodies only; whereas to be circumscribed by <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> limits belongs to all creatures, both corporeal and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Spir. Sanct. i, 7) that "although some things are not contained in corporeal place, still they are none the less circumscribed by their <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether an angel is composed of matter and form?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. For everything which is contained under any genus is composed of the genus, and of the difference which added to the genus makes the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But the genus comes from the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and the difference from the form (Metaph. xiii, text 6). Therefore everything which is in a genus is composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. But an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is in the genus of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Therefore he is composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, wherever the properties of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, there is <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Now the properties of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> are to receive and to substand; whence <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Trin.) that "a simple form cannot be a subject": and the above properties are found in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. Therefore an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, form is act. So what is form only is <a href="../cathen/01125b.htm">pure act</a>. But an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is not <a href="../cathen/01125b.htm">pure act</a>, for this belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. Therefore an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is not form only, but has a form in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, form is properly limited and perfected by <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. So the form which is not in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> form. But the form of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is not <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, for every creature is finite. Therefore the form of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv): "The first creatures are understood to be as immaterial as they are incorporeal."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some assert that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>; which opinion Avicebron endeavored to establish in his book of the Fount of Life. For he supposes that whatever things are distinguished by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> are really distinct. Now as regards incorporeal <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> apprehends that which distinguishes it from corporeal <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, and that which it has in common with it. Hence he concludes that what distinguishes incorporeal from corporeal <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is a kind of form to it, and whatever is subject to this distinguishing form, as it were something common, is its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Therefore, he asserts the universal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and corporeal things is the same; so that it must be understood that the form of incorporeal <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is impressed in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, in the same way as the form of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> is impressed in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of corporeal things.

<p>But one glance is enough to show that there cannot be one <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and of corporeal things. For it is not possible that a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and a corporeal form should be received into the same part of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, otherwise one and the same thing would be corporeal and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>. Hence it would follow that one part of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> receives the corporeal form, and another receives the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> form. Matter, however, is not divisible into parts except as regarded under <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>; and without <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is indivisible, as <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> says (Phys. i, text 15). Therefore it would follow that the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things is subject to <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>; which cannot be. Therefore it is impossible that corporeal and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things should have the same <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p>It is, further, impossible for an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> to have any kind of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. For the operation belonging to anything is according to the mode of its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Now to understand is an altogether immaterial operation, as appears from its object, whence any act receives its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For a thing is understood according to its degree of immateriality; because forms that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> are <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> forms which the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> cannot apprehend as such. Hence it must be that every <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is altogether immaterial.

<p>But things distinguished by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> are not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> distinguished in reality; because the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> does not apprehend things according to their mode, but according to its own mode. Hence material things which are below our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in a simpler mode than they <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in themselves. Angelic <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, on the other hand, are above our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; and hence our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> cannot attain to apprehend them, as they are in themselves, but by its own mode, according as it apprehends composite things; and in this way also it apprehends <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is difference which constitutes the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Now everything is constituted in a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> according as it is determined to some special grade of being because "the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of things are like numbers," which differ by addition and subtraction of unity, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. viii, text 10). But in material things there is one thing which determines to a special grade, and that is the form; and another thing which is determined, and this is the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; and hence from the latter the "genus" is derived, and from the former the "difference." Whereas in immaterial things there is no separate determinator and thing determined; each thing by its own self holds a determinate grade in being; and therefore in them "genus" and "difference" are not derived from different things, but from one and the same. Nevertheless, this differs in our mode of conception; for, inasmuch as our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> considers it as indeterminate, it derives the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of their "genus"; and inasmuch as it considers it determinately, it derives the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of their "difference."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This reason is given in the book on the Fount of Life, and it would be cogent, supposing that the receptive mode of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> were the same. But this is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. For <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> receives the form, that thereby it may be constituted in some <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, either of air, or of fire, or of something else. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> does not receive the form in the same way; otherwise the opinion of Empedocles (De Anima i, 5, text 26) would be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, to the effect that we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> earth by earth, and fire by fire. But the intelligible form is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> according to the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a form; for as such is it so <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Hence such a way of receiving is not that of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but of an immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although there is no composition of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> in an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, yet there is act and <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. And this can be made evident if we consider the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of material things which contain a twofold composition. The first is that of form and <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, whereby the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is constituted. Such a composite <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not its own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> but <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is its act. Hence the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> itself is related to its own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> as <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to act. Therefore if there be no <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and supposing that the form itself subsists without <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, there nevertheless still remains the relation of the form to its very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, as of <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to act. And such a kind of composition is understood to be in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; and this is what some say, that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is composed of, "whereby he is," and "what is," or "<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>," and "what is," as <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says. For "what is," is the form itself subsisting; and the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> itself is whereby the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is; as the running is whereby the runner runs. But in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>" and "what is" are not different as was explained above (Question 3, Article 4). Hence <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is <a href="../cathen/01125b.htm">pure act</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Every creature is simply finite, inasmuch as its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is not absolutely subsisting, but is limited to some <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to which it belongs. But there is nothing against a creature being considered relatively <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. Material creatures are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> on the part of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but finite in their form, which is limited by the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> which receives it. But immaterial <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> are finite in their being; whereas they are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in the sense that their forms are not received in anything else; as if we were to say, for example, that whiteness <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> separate is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> as regards the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of whiteness, forasmuch as it is not contracted to any one subject; while its "being" is finite as determined to some one special <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p>Whence it is said (De Causis, prop. 16) that "<a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> is finite from above," as receiving its being from above itself, and is "<a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> from below," as not received in any <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the angels exist in any great number?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are not in great numbers. For number is a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, and follows the division of a continuous body. But this cannot be in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, since they are incorporeal, as was shown above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in any great number.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the more a thing approaches to unity, so much the less is it multiplied, as is evident in numbers. But among other <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> natures the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> approaches nearest to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is supremely one, it seems that there is the least possible number in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the proper effect of the separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> seems to be the movements of the heavenly bodies. But the movements of the heavenly bodies fall within some small determined number, which we can apprehend. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are not in greater number than the movements of the heavenly bodies.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that "all intelligible and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> subsist because of the rays of the divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>." But a ray is only multiplied according to the different things that receive it. Now it cannot be said that their <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is receptive of an intelligible ray, since <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> are immaterial, as was shown above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Therefore it seems that the multiplication of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> can only be according to the requirements of the first bodies--that is, of the heavenly ones, so that in some way the shedding form of the aforesaid rays may be terminated in them; and hence the same conclusion is to be drawn as before.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/dan007.htm#verse10">Daniel 7:10</a>): "Thousands of thousands ministered to Him, and ten thousands times a hundred thousand stood before Him."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There have been various opinions with regard to the number of the separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> contended that the separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> are the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of sensible things; as if we were to maintain that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is a separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of itself: and according to this view it would have to be maintained that the number of the separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> is the number of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of sensible things. <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, however, rejects this view (Metaph. i, text 31) because <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is of the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of sensible things. Consequently the separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> cannot be the exemplar <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of these sensible things; but have their own fixed <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, which are higher than the natures of sensible things. Nevertheless <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> held (Metaph. xi, text 43) that those more perfect natures bear relation to these sensible things, as that of mover and end; and therefore he strove to find out the number of the separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> according to the number of the first movements.

<p>But since this appears to militate against the teachings of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Sacred Scripture</a>, <a href="../cathen/09540b.htm">Rabbi Moses</a> the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jew</a>, wishing to bring both into harmony, held that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, in so far as they are styled immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, are multiplied according to the number of heavenly movements or bodies, as <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> held (Metaph. xi, text 43); while he contended that in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> even men bearing a divine message are styled <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; and again, even the powers of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things, which manifest <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> almighty power. It is, however, quite foreign to the custom of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> for the powers of irrational things to be designated as <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p>Hence it must be said that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, even inasmuch as they are immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in exceeding great number, far beyond all material multitude. This is what <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. xiv): "There are many blessed armies of the heavenly intelligences, surpassing the weak and limited reckoning of our material numbers." The reason whereof is this, because, since it is the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> chiefly intends in the creation of things, the more perfect some things are, in so much greater an excess are they <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now, as in bodies such excess is observed in regard to their magnitude, so in things incorporeal is it observed in regard to their multitude. We see, in fact, that incorruptible bodies, exceed corruptible bodies almost incomparably in magnitude; for the entire sphere of things active and passive is something very small in comparison with the heavenly bodies. Hence it is reasonable to conclude that the immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> as it were incomparably exceed material <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> as to multitude.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> number is not that of discrete <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, brought about by division of what is continuous, but that which is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by distinction of forms; according as multitude is reckoned among the transcendentals, as was said above (30, 3; 11).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> From the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> being the nighest unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it must needs have least of multitude in its composition, but not so as to be found in few subjects.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This is <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> argument (Metaph. xii, text 44), and it would conclude <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> if the separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> were made for corporeal <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. For thus the immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> would <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> to no purpose, unless some movement from them were to appear in corporeal things. But it is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> on account of the corporeal, because the end is nobler than the means to the end. Hence <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> says (Metaph. xii, text 44) that this is not a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> argument, but a probable one. He was forced to make use of this argument, since only through sensible things can we come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> intelligible ones.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> This argument comes from the opinion of such as hold that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the distinction of things; but this was refuted above (Question 47, Article 1). Accordingly, the multiplication of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> is not to be taken according to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, nor according to bodies, but according to the divine wisdom devising the various orders of immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the angels differ in species?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not differ in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. For since the "difference" is nobler than the 'genus,' all things which agree in what is noblest in them, agree likewise in their ultimate constitutive difference; and so they are the same according to <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But all <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> agree in what is noblest in them--that is to say, in intellectuality. Therefore all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are of one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, more and less do not change a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> seem to differ only from one another according to more and less--namely, as one is simpler than another, and of keener <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not differ specifically.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> are contra-distinguished mutually from each other. But all <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are of the one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. So therefore are the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the more perfect a thing is in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the more ought it to be multiplied. But this would not be so if there were but one <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> under one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Therefore there are many <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> In things of one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> there is no such thing as "first" and "second" [prius et posterius], as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. iii, text 2). But in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> even of the one order there are first, middle, and last, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Hier. Ang. x). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are not of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some have said that all <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, even <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, are of the one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Others, again, that all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are of the one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but not <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; while others allege that all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of one <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, or even of one order, are of the one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p>But this is impossible. For such things as agree in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> but differ in number, agree in <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, but are distinguished materially. If, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> be not composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, as was said above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), it follows that it is impossible for two <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to be of one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; just as it would be impossible for there to be several whitenesses apart, or several humanities, since whitenesses are not several, except in so far as they are in several <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. And if the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> had <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, not even then could there be several <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. For it would be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to be the principle of distinction of one from the other, not, indeed, according to the division of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, since they are incorporeal, but according to the diversity of their powers; and such diversity of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> diversity not merely of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but of genus.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> "Difference" is nobler than "genus," as the determined is more noble than the undetermined, and the proper than the common, but not as one <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is nobler than another; otherwise it would be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that all irrational animals be of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; or that there should be in them some form which is higher than the sensible <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore irrational animals differ in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> according to the various determined degrees of sensitive <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and in like manner all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> differ in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> according to the diverse degrees of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> More and less change the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, not according as they are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the intensity or remissness of one form, but according as they are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by forms of diverse degrees; for instance, if we say that fire is more perfect than air: and in this way the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are diversified according to more or less.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> preponderates over the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. Hence it is much better for the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> to be multiplied in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> than for <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> to be multiplied in the one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Numerical multiplication, since it can be drawn out <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a>, is not intended by the agent, but only specific multiplication, as was said above (Question 47, Article 3). Hence the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> calls for the multiplying of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but not for the multiplying of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> in one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the angels are incorruptible?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are not incorruptible; for <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a>, speaking of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, says (De Fide Orth. ii, 3) that he is "an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, partaking of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> by favor, and not by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> says in the Timaeus: "O gods of gods, whose maker and father am I: You are indeed my works, dissoluble by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, yet indissoluble because I so will it." But gods such as these can only be understood to be the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are corruptible by their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xvi), "all things would tend towards nothing, unless the hand of the Almighty preserved them." But what can be brought to nothing is corruptible. Therefore, since the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it would appear that they are corruptible of their own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> "have unfailing life, being free from all corruption, death, <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and generation."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It must <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> be maintained that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are incorruptible of their own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. The reason for this is, that nothing is corrupted except by its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> being separated from the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Hence, since an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is a subsisting form, as is clear from what was said above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), it is impossible for its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> to be corruptible. For what belongs to anything considered in itself can never be separated from it; but what belongs to a thing, considered in relation to something else, can be separated, when that something else is taken away, in view of which it belonged to it. Roundness can never be taken from the circle, because it belongs to it of itself; but a bronze circle can lose roundness, if the bronze be deprived of its circular shape. Now to be belongs to a form considered in itself; for everything is an actual being according to its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>: whereas <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is an actual being by the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Consequently a subject composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> ceases to be actually when the form is separated from the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But if the form subsists in its own being, as happens in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as was said above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), it cannot lose its being. Therefore, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> immateriality is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> why it is incorruptible by its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p>A token of this incorruptibility can be gathered from its <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> operation; for since everything acts according as it is actual, the operation of a thing indicates its mode of being. Now the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the operation is understood from the object. But an intelligible object, being above time, is everlasting. Hence every <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is incorruptible of its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> is dealing with perfect <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, which includes complete immutability; since "every change is a kind of death," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Maxim. iii). The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> obtain perfect immutability only by favor, as will appear later (62).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> By the expression 'gods' <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> understands the heavenly bodies, which he supposed to be made up of elements, and therefore dissoluble of their own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; yet they are for ever preserved in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> by the Divine will.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As was observed above (Question 44, Article 1) there is a kind of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> thing which has a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of its <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. Hence it is not repugnant to a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> or incorruptible being to depend for its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> on another as its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Therefore, when it is said that all things, even the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, would lapse into nothing, unless preserved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is not to be gathered therefrom that there is any principle of corruption in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; but that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> is dependent upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. For a thing is said to be corruptible not merely because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can reduce it to non-existence, by withdrawing His act of preservation; but also because it has some principle of corruption within itself, or some contrariety, or at least the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.
