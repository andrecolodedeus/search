<h1>Question 51. The angels in comparison with bodies</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1051.htm#article1"> Do angels have bodies naturally united to them?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1051.htm#article2"> Do they assume bodies?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1051.htm#article3"> Do they exercise functions of life in the bodies assumed?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the angels have bodies naturally united to them?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have bodies <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> united to them. For <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> says (Peri Archon i): "It is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> attribute alone--that is, it belongs to the Father, the Son, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as a property of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, that He is understood to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> without any material <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> and without any companionship of corporeal addition." <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">Bernard</a> likewise says (Hom. vi. super Cant.): "Let us assign incorporeity to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone even as we do <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> alone, neither for its own sake nor on account of anything else, needs the help of any corporeal organ. But it is clear that every <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> spirit needs corporeal <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>." <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> also says (Gen. ad lit. iii): "The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are called animals of the atmosphere because their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is akin to that of aerial bodies." But the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> is the same. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have bodies <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> united to them.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Hom. x in Ev.) calls an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> a rational animal. But every animal is composed of body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have bodies <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> united to them.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, life is more perfect in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> than in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> not only lives, but gives life to the body. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> animate bodies which are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> united to them.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that "the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are understood to be incorporeal."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have not bodies <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> united to them. For whatever belongs to any <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> is not found universally in that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; thus, for instance, to have wings, because it is not of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of an animal, does not belong to every animal. Now since to understand is not the act of a body, nor of any corporeal energy, as will be shown later (75, 2), it follows that to have a body united to it is not of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, as such; but it is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to some <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> on account of something else. Even so it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be united to a body, because it is imperfect and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a> in the genus of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, not having the fulness of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but acquiring it from sensible things through the bodily senses, as will be explained later on (84, 6; 89, 1). Now whenever we find something imperfect in any genus we must presuppose something perfect in that genus. Therefore in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> there are some perfectly <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, which do not need to acquire <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from sensible things. Consequently not all <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> are united to bodies; but some are quite separated from bodies, and these we call <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As was said above (Question 50, Article 1) it was the opinion of some that every being is a body; and consequently some seem to have thought that there were no <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">incorporeal substances</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> except as united to bodies; so much so that some even held that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the world, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> tells us (De Civ. Dei vii). As this is contrary to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, which asserts that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is exalted above all things, according to <a href="../bible/psa008.htm#verse2">Psalm 8:2</a>: "Thy magnificence is exalted beyond the heavens"; <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, while refusing to say such a thing of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, followed the above opinion of others regarding the other <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>; being deceived here as he was also in many other points, by following the opinions of the ancient <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>. <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">Bernard's</a> expression can be explained, that the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> spirit needs some bodily instrument, which is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> united to it, but assumed for some purpose, as will be explained (2). <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> speaks, not as asserting the fact, but merely using the opinion of the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a>, who maintained that there are some aerial animals, which they termed <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> calls the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> a rational animal metaphorically, on account of the likeness to the rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> To give life effectively is a perfection simply speaking; hence it belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as is said (<a href="../bible/1sa002.htm#verse6">1 Samuel 2:6</a>): "The Lord killeth, and maketh alive." But to give life formally belongs to a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> which is part of some <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and which has not within itself the full <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Hence an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> which is not united to a body is more perfect than one which is united to a body.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether angels assume bodies?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not assume bodies. For there is nothing superfluous in the work of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, as there is nothing of the kind in the work of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But it would be superfluous for the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to assume bodies, because an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> has no need for a body, since his own power exceeds all bodily power. Therefore an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> does not assume a body.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every assumption is terminated in some union; because to assume implies a taking to oneself [ad se sumere]. But a body is not united to an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> as to a form, as stated (1); while in so far as it is united to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> as to a mover, it is not said to be assumed, otherwise it would follow that all bodies moved by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are assumed by them. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not assume bodies.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not assume bodies from the earth or water, or they could not suddenly disappear; nor again from fire, otherwise they would burn whatever things they touched; nor again from air, because air is without shape or color. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not assume bodies.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xvi) that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> appeared to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> under assumed bodies.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some have maintained that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> never assume bodies, but that all that we read in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> of apparitions of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> happened in <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> vision--that is, according to <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>. But this is contrary to the intent of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>; for whatever is beheld in <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision is only in the beholder's <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, and consequently is not seen by everybody. Yet <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Divine Scripture</a> from time to time introduces <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> so apparent as to be seen commonly by all; just as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who appeared to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> were seen by him and by his whole <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, by Lot, and by the citizens of Sodom; in like manner the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who appeared to <a href="../cathen/14749c.htm">Tobias</a> was seen by all present. From all this it is clearly shown that such apparitions were beheld by bodily vision, whereby the object seen <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> outside the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> beholding it, and can accordingly be seen by all. Now by such a vision only a body can be beheld. Consequently, since the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are not bodies, nor have they bodies <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> united with them, as is clear from what has been said (1; 50, 1), it follows that they sometimes assume bodies.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Angels need an assumed body, not for themselves, but on our account; that by conversing familiarly with men they may give evidence of that <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> companionship which men expect to have with them in the life to come. Moreover that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> assumed bodies under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was a figurative indication that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> would take a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body; because all the apparitions in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> were ordained to that one whereby the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> appeared in the flesh.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The body assumed is united to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> not as its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, nor merely as its mover, but as its mover represented by the assumed movable body. For as in the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Sacred Scripture</a> the properties of intelligible things are set forth by the likenesses of things sensible, in the same way by Divine power sensible bodies are so fashioned by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> as fittingly to represent the intelligible properties of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. And this is what we mean by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> assuming a body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although air as long as it is in a state of rarefaction has neither shape nor color, yet when condensed it can both be shaped and colored as appears in the clouds. Even so the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> assume bodies of air, condensing it by the Divine power in so far as is needful for forming the assumed body.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the angels exercise functions of life in the bodies assumed?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> exercise functions of life in assumed bodies. For pretence is unbecoming in <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But it would be pretence if the body assumed by them, which seems to live and to exercise vital functions, did not possess these functions. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> exercise functions of life in the assumed body.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in the works of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> there is nothing without a purpose. But eyes, nostrils, and the other instruments of the senses, would be fashioned without a purpose in the body assumed by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, if he perceived nothing by their means. Consequently, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> perceives by the assumed body; and this is the most special function of life.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to move hither and thither is one of the functions of life, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima ii). But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are manifestly seen to move in their assumed bodies. For it was said (<a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse16">Genesis 18:16</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> walked with" the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who had appeared to him, "bringing them on the way"; and when <a href="../cathen/14749c.htm">Tobias</a> said to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> (<a href="../bible/tob005.htm#verse7">Tobit 5:7-8</a>): "Knowest thou the way that leadeth to the city of <a href="../cathen/10117a.htm">Medes</a>?" he answered: "I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it; and I have often walked through all the ways thereof." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> often exercise functions of life in assumed bodies.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, speech is the function of a living subject, for it is produced by the voice, while the voice itself is a sound conveyed from the mouth. But it is evident from many passages of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Sacred Scripture</a> that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> spoke in assumed bodies. Therefore in their assumed bodies they exercise functions of life.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, eating is a purely animal function. Hence the Lord after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> ate with His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of having resumed life (<a href="../bible/luk024.htm">Luke 24</a>). Now when <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> appeared in their assumed bodies they ate, and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> offered them food, after having previously <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> them as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse18">Genesis 18</a>). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> exercise functions of life in assumed bodies.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, to beget offspring is a vital act. But this has befallen the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in their assumed bodies; for it is related: "After the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> went in to the daughters of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and they brought forth children, these are the mighty men of old, men of renown" (<a href="../bible/gen006.htm#verse4">Genesis 6:4</a>). Consequently the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> exercised vital functions in their assumed bodies.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The bodies assumed by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have no life, as was stated in the previous article (ad 3). Therefore they cannot exercise functions of life through assumed bodies.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some functions of living subjects have something in common with other operations; just as speech, which is the function of a living creature, agrees with other sounds of inanimate things, in so far as it is sound; and walking agrees with other movements, in so far as it is movement. Consequently vital functions can be performed in assumed bodies by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as to that which is common in such operations; but not as to that which is special to living subjects; because, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Somn. et Vig. i), "that which has the faculty has the action." Hence nothing can have a function of life except what has life, which is the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a> principle of such action.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As it is in no wise contrary to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> for intelligible things to be set forth in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> under sensible figures, since it is not said for the purpose of maintaining that intelligible things are sensible, but in order that properties of intelligible things may be understood according to similitude through sensible figures; so it is not contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> that through their assumed bodies they appear to be living men, although they are really not. For the bodies are assumed merely for this purpose, that the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> properties and works of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> may be manifested by the properties of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and of his works. This could not so fittingly be done if they were to assume <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> men; because the properties of such men would lead us to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and not to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Sensation is entirely a vital function. Consequently it can in no way be said that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> perceive through the organs of their assumed bodies. Yet such bodies are not fashioned in vain; for they are not fashioned for the purpose of sensation through them, but to this end, that by such bodily organs the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> powers of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> may be made manifest; just as by the eye the power of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is pointed out, and other powers by the other members, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> teaches (Coel. Hier.).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Movement coming from a united mover is a proper function of life; but the bodies assumed by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are not thus moved, since the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are not their forms. Yet the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are moved <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, when such bodies are moved, since they are in them as movers are in the moved; and they are here in such a way as not to be elsewhere which cannot be said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Accordingly, although <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not moved when the things are moved in which He <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>, since He is everywhere; yet the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are moved <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> according to the movement of the bodies assumed. But they are not moved according to the movement of the heavenly bodies, even though they be in them as the movers in the thing moved, because the heavenly bodies do not change place in their entirety; nor for the spirit which moves the world is there any fixed locality according to any restricted part of the world's <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, which now is in the east, and now in the west, but according to a fixed quarter; because "the moving energy is always in the east," as stated in Phys. viii, text 84.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Properly speaking, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not talk through their assumed bodies; yet there is a semblance of speech, in so far as they fashion sounds in the air like to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> voices.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Properly speaking, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> cannot be said to eat, because eating involves the taking of food convertible into the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the eater.

<p>Although after the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> food was not converted into the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, but resolved into pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; nevertheless <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had a body of such a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that food could be changed into it; hence it was a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> eating. But the food taken by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> was neither changed into the assumed body, nor was the body of such a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that food could be changed into it; consequently, it was not a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> eating, but figurative of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> eating. This is what the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> said to <a href="../cathen/14749c.htm">Tobias</a>: "When I was with you, I seemed indeed to eat and to drink; but I use an invisible meat and drink" (<a href="../bible/tob012.htm#verse19">Tobit 12:19</a>).

<p><a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> offered them food, deeming them to be men, in whom, nevertheless, he worshipped <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is wont to be in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xvi).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xv): "Many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> affirm that they have had the experience, or have heard from such as have experienced it, that the Satyrs and Fauns, whom the common folk call incubi, have often presented themselves before <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and have sought and procured intercourse with them. Hence it is folly to deny it. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> could not fall in such fashion before the <a href="../cathen/04702a.htm">deluge</a>. Hence by the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are to be understood the sons of Seth, who were <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; while by the daughters of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> designates those who sprang from the race of Cain. Nor is it to be wondered at that giants should be born of them; for they were not all giants, albeit there were many more before than after the <a href="../cathen/04702a.htm">deluge</a>." Still if some are occasionally begotten from <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, it is not from the seed of such <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, nor from their assumed bodies, but from the seed of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> taken for the purpose; as when the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> assumes first the form of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and afterwards of a man; just as they take the seed of other things for other generating purposes, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. ii.), so that the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> born is not the child of a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, but of a man.
