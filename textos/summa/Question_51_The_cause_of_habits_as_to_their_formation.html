<h1>Question 51. The cause of habits, as to their formation</h1>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether any habit is from nature?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that no <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For the use of those things which are from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> does not depend on the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. But <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> "is that which we use when we will," as the <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Commentator</a> says on De Anima iii. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is not from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> does not employ two where one is sufficient. But the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. If therefore the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of the powers were from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> and power would be one.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> does not fail in necessaries. But <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in order to act well, as we have stated above (Question 49, Article 4). If therefore any <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> were from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it seems that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> would not fail to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> all <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>: but this is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are not from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> In Ethic. vi, 6, among other <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, place is given to understanding of first principles, which <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: wherefore also first principles are said to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> One thing can be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to another in two ways. First in respect of the specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as the faculty of laughing is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to fire to have an upward tendency. Secondly, in respect of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> or <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> to be prone to sickness or inclined to health, in accordance with their respective temperaments. Again, in respect of both <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, something may be called <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> in two ways: first, because it entirely is from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; secondly, because it is partly from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and partly from an extrinsic principle. For instance, when a man is healed by himself, his health is entirely from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; but when a man is healed by means of medicine, health is partly from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, partly from an extrinsic principle.

<p>Thus, then, if we speak of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> as a disposition of the subject in relation to form or <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it may be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> in either of the foregoing ways. For there is a certain <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> disposition demanded by the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, so that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can be without it. And this disposition is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> in respect of the specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But since such a disposition has a certain latitude, it happens that different grades of this disposition are becoming to different men in respect of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. And this disposition may be either entirely from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, or partly from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and partly from an extrinsic principle, as we have said of those who are healed by means of art.

<p>But the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> which is a disposition to operation, and whose subject is a power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as stated above (Question 50, Article 2), may be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> whether in respect of the specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or in respect of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: in respect of the specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, on the part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself, which, since it is the form of the body, is the specific principle; but in respect of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, on the part of the body, which is the material principle. Yet in neither way does it happen that there are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, so that they be entirely from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, indeed, this does happen, since they have intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> impressed on them, which cannot be said of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as we have said in the I, 55, 2; I, 84, 3.

<p>There are, therefore, in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> certain <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, owing their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, partly to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and partly to some extrinsic principle: in one way, indeed, in the apprehensive powers; in another way, in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> powers. For in the apprehensive powers there may be a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> by way of a beginning, both in respect of the specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and in respect of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. This happens with regard to the specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, on the part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself: thus the understanding of first principles is called a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. For it is owing to the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, having once grasped what is a whole and what is a part, should at once perceive that every whole is larger than its part: and in like manner with regard to other such principles. Yet what is a whole, and what is a part--this he cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> except through the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> which he has received from phantasms: and for this reason, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> at the end of the Posterior Analytics shows that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of principles comes to us from the senses.

<p>But in respect of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> as to its beginning, in so far as one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, from the disposition of his organs of sense, is more apt than another to understand well, since we need the sensitive powers for the operation of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> powers, however, no <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> in its beginning, on the part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself, as to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>; but only as to certain principles thereof, as, for instance, the principles of common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> are called the "nurseries of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>." The reason of this is because the inclination to its proper objects, which seems to be the beginning of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, does not belong to the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, but rather to the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the powers.

<p>But on the part of the body, in respect of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, there are some <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> by way of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> beginnings. For some are disposed from their own bodily temperament to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> or meekness or such like.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This objection takes <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as divided against reason and will; whereas reason itself and will belong to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Something may be added even <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a power, while it cannot belong to the power itself. For instance, with regard to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, it cannot belong to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> power itself capable of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> all things: for thus it would have to be the act of all things, which belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. Because that by which something is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, must needs be the actual likeness of the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>: whence it would follow, if the power of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> all things by itself, that it was the likeness and act of all things. Wherefore there must needs be added to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>' <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> power, some intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, which are likenesses of things understood: for it is by participation of the Divine wisdom and not by their own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, that their <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can be actually those things which they understand. And so it is clear that not everything belonging to a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> can belong to the power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> is not equally inclined to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> all the various kinds of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>: since some can be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and some not, as we have said above. And so it does not follow that because some <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, therefore all are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether any habit is caused by acts?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that no <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by acts. For <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, as we have said above (Question 49, Article 1). Now every <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in a subject, according to the latter's receptivity. Since then the agent, inasmuch as it acts, does not receive but rather gives: it seems impossible for a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> to be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in an agent by its own acts.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the thing wherein a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> is moved to that <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, as may be clearly seen in that which is heated or cooled: whereas that which produces the act that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, moves, as may be seen in that which heats or cools. If therefore <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> were <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in anything by its own act, it would follow that the same would be mover and moved, active and passive: which is impossible, as stated in Physics iii, 8.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the effect cannot be more noble than its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is more noble than the act which precedes the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>; as is clear from the fact that the latter produces more noble acts. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by an act which precedes the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. ii, 1,2) teaches that <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by acts.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In the agent there is sometimes only the active principle of its act: for instance in fire there is only the active principle of heating. And in such an agent a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by its own act: for which reason <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things cannot become accustomed or unaccustomed, as is stated in Ethic. ii, 1. But a certain agent is to be found, in which there is both the active and the passive principle of its act, as we see in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>. For the acts of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power proceed from that same power according as it is moved by the apprehensive power presenting the object: and further, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> power, according as it reasons about conclusions, has, as it were, an active principle in a self-evident proposition. Wherefore by such acts <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> can be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in their agents; not indeed with regard to the first active principle, but with regard to that principle of the act, which principle is a mover moved. For everything that is passive and moved by another, is disposed by the action of the agent; wherefore if the acts be multiplied a certain <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> is formed in the power which is passive and moved, which <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> is called a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>: just as the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> powers, according as they are moved by the reason, and as the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of science are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, according as it is moved by first propositions.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The agent, as agent, does not receive anything. But in so far as it moves through being moved by another, it receives something from that which moves it: and thus is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The same thing, and in the same respect, cannot be mover and moved; but nothing prevents a thing from being moved by itself as to different respects, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in Physics viii, text. 28,29.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The act which precedes the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, in so far as it comes from an active principle, proceeds from a more excellent principle than is the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> thereby: just as the reason is a more excellent principle than the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> produced in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power by repeated acts, and as the understanding of first principles is a more excellent principle than the science of conclusions.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether a habit can be caused by one act?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> can be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by one act. For demonstration is an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. But science, which is the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of one conclusion, is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by one demonstration. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> can be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by one act.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as acts happen to increase by multiplication so do they happen to increase by intensity. But a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by multiplication of acts. Therefore also if an act be very intense, it can be the generating <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, health and sickness are <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>. But it happens that a man is healed or becomes ill, by one act. Therefore one act can <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. i, 7): "As neither does one swallow nor one day make spring: so neither does one day nor a short time make a man blessed and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>." But "<a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is an operation in respect of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>" (Ethic. i, 7,10,13). Therefore a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and for the same reason, other <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, is not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by one act.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As we have said already (2), <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by act, because a passive power is moved by an active principle. But in order that some <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in that which is passive the active principle must entirely overcome the passive. Whence we see that because fire cannot at once overcome the combustible, it does not enkindle at once; but it gradually expels contrary dispositions, so that by overcoming it entirely, it may impress its likeness on it. Now it is clear that the active principle which is reason, cannot entirely overcome the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power in one act: because the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power is inclined variously, and to many things; while the reason judges in a single act, what should be willed in regard to various aspects and circumstances. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power is not thereby entirely overcome, so as to be inclined like <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to the same thing, in the majority of cases; which inclination belongs to the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by one act, but only by many.

<p>But in the apprehensive powers, we must observe that there are two passive principles: one is the "possible" [See I, 79, 2 ad 2] <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> itself; the other is the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> which <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> (De Anima iii, text. 20) calls "passive," and is the "particular reason," that is the cogitative power, with <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>. With regard then to the former passive principle, it is possible for a certain active principle to entirely overcome, by one act, the power of its passive principle: thus one self-evident proposition convinces the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, so that it gives a firm assent to the conclusion, but a probable proposition cannot do this. Wherefore a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of opinion needs to be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by many acts of the reason, even on the part of the "possible" <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>: whereas a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of science can be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by a single act of the reason, so far as the "possible" <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is concerned. But with regard to the lower apprehensive powers, the same acts need to be repeated many times for anything to be firmly impressed on the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>. And so the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Memor. et Remin. 1) that "meditation strengthens <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>." Bodily <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, however, can be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by one act, if the active principle is of great power: sometimes, for instance, a strong dose of medicine restores health at once.

<p>Hence the solutions to the objections are clear.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether any habits are infused in man by God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that no <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is infused in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> treats all equally. If therefore He infuses <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> into some, He would infuse them into all: which is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> works in all things according to the mode which is suitable to their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: for "it belongs to <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a> to preserve <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>," as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv). But <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by acts, as we have said above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> to be in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> except by acts.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if any <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> be infused into <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can by that <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> perform many acts. But "from those acts a like <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a>" (Ethic. ii, 1,2). Consequently there will be two <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in the same <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, one acquired, the other infused. Now this seems impossible: for the two forms of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> cannot be in the same subject. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is not infused into <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> it is written (<a href="../bible/sir015.htm#verse5">Sirach 15:5</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> filled him with the spirit of wisdom and understanding." Now wisdom and understanding are <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>. Therefore some <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are infused into <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are infused by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> into <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, for two reasons.

<p>The first reason is because there are some <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> by which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is disposed to an end which exceeds the proportion of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, namely, the ultimate and perfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as stated above (Question 5, Article 5). And since <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> need to be in proportion with that to which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is disposed by them, therefore is it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that those <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, which dispose to this end, exceed the proportion of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Wherefore such <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> can never be in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> except by Divine infusion, as is the case with all gratuitous <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p>The other reason is, because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can produce the effects of second <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, without these second <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, as we have said in the I, 105, 6. Just as, therefore, sometimes, in order to show His power, He <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> health, without its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but which <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> could have <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a>, so also, at times, for the manifestation of His power, He infuses into <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> even those <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> which can be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power. Thus He gave to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> the science of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> and of all tongues, which men can acquire by study or by custom, but not so perfectly.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in respect of His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, is the same to all, but in respect of the order of His Wisdom, for some fixed motive, gives certain things to some, which He does not give to others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> That <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> works in all according to their mode, does not hinder <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from doing what <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> cannot do: but it follows from this that He does nothing contrary to that which is suitable to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Acts produced by an infused <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, do not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, but strengthen the already <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>; just as the remedies of medicine given to a man who is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> health, do not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a kind of health, but give new strength to the health he had before.
