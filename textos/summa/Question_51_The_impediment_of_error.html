<h1>Question 51. The impediment of error</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5051.htm#article1"> Is error of its very nature an impediment to Matrimony?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5051.htm#article2"> What kind of error?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether it is right to reckon error as an impediment to marriage?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> should not be reckoned in itself an impediment to marriage. For consent, which is the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of marriage, is hindered in the same way as the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iii, 1), may be hindered by <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. But <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is not the same as <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, because <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> excludes <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> altogether, whereas <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> does not, since "<a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is to approve the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> as though it were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>," according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. ix, 11). Therefore <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> rather than <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> should have been reckoned here as an impediment to marriage.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which of its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> can be an impediment to marriage is in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of marriage. But <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is not a thing of this kind. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is not by its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> an impediment to marriage.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as consent is required for marriage, so is <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> required for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Now if one were to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> John, thinking to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> Peter, John would be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> none the less. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> does not annul <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, there was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> marriage between Lia and <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, and yet, in this case, there was <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> does not annul a marriage.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said in the Digests (Si per errorem, ff. De jurisdic. omn. judic.): "What is more opposed to consent than <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>?" Now consent is required for marriage. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is an impediment to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>.

<p>Further, consent denotes something <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is an obstacle to the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, since "the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>," according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iii, 1), <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. ii, 24), and <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> [Nemesius] (De Nat. Hom. xxxii), "is that which has its principle in one who has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of singulars which are the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of actions." But this does not apply to one who is in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is an impediment to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Whatever hinders a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, of its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> hinders the effect likewise. Now consent is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>, as stated above (Question 45, Article 1). Hence whatever voids the consent, voids marriage. Now consent is an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, presupposing an act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; and if the first be lacking, the second must needs be lacking also. Hence, when <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> hinders <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, there follows a defect in the consent also, and consequently in the marriage. Therefore it is possible according to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> for <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> to void marriage.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Speaking simply, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> differs from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, because <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> does not of its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> imply an act of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, while <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> supposes a wrong judgment of reason about something. However, as regards being an impediment to the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, it differs not whether we call it <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, since no <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> can be an impediment to the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, unless it have <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in conjunction with it, because the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will's</a> act presupposes an estimate or judgment about something which is the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Wherefore if there be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> there must needs be <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; and for this reason <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is set down as being the proximate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is not of itself contrary to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>, it is contrary thereto as regards the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of marriage.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The character of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> directly by the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the baptizer, but by the material element applied outwardly; and the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is effective only as directing the material element to its effect; whereas the marriage tie is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the consent directly. Hence the comparison fails.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> (Sent. iv, D, 30) the marriage between Lia and <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> was effected not by their coming together, which happened through an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, but by their consent, which followed afterwards. Yet both are clearly to be excused from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (Sent. iv, D, 30).

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether every error is an impediment to matrimony?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that every <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is an impediment to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>, and not, as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 30), only <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> about the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> or the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. For that which applies to a thing as such applies to it in all its bearings. Now <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is of its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> an impediment to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore every <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is an impediment to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, as such, is an impediment to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>, the greater the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> the greater the impediment. Now the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> who disbelieves in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is greater than an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Therefore it should be a greater impediment than <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> about the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> does not void marriage except as removing voluntariness. Now <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> about any circumstance takes away voluntariness (Ethic. iii, 1). Therefore it is not only <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> about <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> that is an impediment to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, just as the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of slavery is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> affecting the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, so are bodily or <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>. But <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> regarding the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> is an impediment to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> or fortune is equally an impediment.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, just as slavery or freedom pertains to the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, so do high and low rank, or dignity of position and the lack thereof. Now <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> regarding the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of slavery is an impediment to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> about the other matters mentioned is also an impediment.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, just as the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of slavery is an impediment, so are difference of worship and impotence, as we shall say further on (52, 2; 58, 1; 59, 1). Therefore just as <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> regarding the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> is an impediment, so also should <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> about those other matters be reckoned an impediment.

<p><strong>Objection 7.</strong> On the other hand, it would seem that not even <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> about the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is an impediment to marriage. For marriage is a contract even as a sale is. Now in buying and selling the sale is not voided if one coin be given instead of another of equal value. Therefore a marriage is not voided if one <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> be taken instead of another.

<p><strong>Objection 8.</strong> Further, it is possible for them to remain in this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> for many years and to beget between them sons and daughters. But it would be a grave assertion to maintain that they ought to be separated then. Therefore their previous <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> did not void their marriage.

<p><strong>Objection 9.</strong> Further, it might happen that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> to the brother of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whom she thinks that she is consenting to marry, and that she has had carnal intercourse with him; in which case, seemingly, she cannot go back to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to whom she thought to give her consent, but should hold on to his brother. Thus <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> regarding the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is not an impediment to marriage.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Just as <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, through <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> involuntariness, is an excuse from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so on the same count is it an impediment to marriage. Now <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> does not excuse from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> unless it refer to a circumstance the presence or absence of which makes an action lawful or unlawful. For if a man were to strike his father with an iron rod thinking it to be of wood, he is not excused from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> wholly, although perhaps in part; but if a man were to strike his father, thinking to strike his son to correct him, he is wholly excused provided he take due care. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, in order to void marriage, must needs be about the essentials of marriage. Now marriage includes two things, namely the two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are joined together, and the mutual power over one another wherein marriage consists. The first of these is removed by <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, the second by <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> regarding the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, since a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> cannot freely give power over his body to another, without his master's consent. For this reason these two <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, and no others, are an impediment to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is not from its generic <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is an impediment to marriage, but from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the difference added thereto; namely from its being <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> about one of the essentials to marriage.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> An <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> about <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> is about things consequent upon <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>, for instance on the question of its being a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, or of its being lawful. Wherefore such <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> as these is no impediment to marriage, as neither does an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> about <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> hinder a man from receiving the character, provided he intend to receive what the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> gives, although he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it to be nothing.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is not any <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of a circumstance that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the involuntariness which is an excuse from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated above; wherefore the argument does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Difference of fortune or of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> does not make a difference in the essentials to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of slavery does. Hence the argument does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">Error</a> about a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> rank, as such, does not void a marriage, for the same reason as neither does <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> about a personal <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>. If, however, the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> about a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> rank or position amounts to an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> about the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, it is an impediment to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>. Hence, if the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> consent directly to this particular <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, her <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> about his rank does not void the marriage; but if she intend directly to consent to marry the king's son, whoever he may be, then, if another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> than the king's son be brought to her, there is <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> about the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and the marriage will be void.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">Error</a> is an impediment to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>, although it be about other <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> to marriage if it concern those things which render a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> an unlawful subject of marriage. But (the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a>) does not mention <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> about such things, because they are an impediment to marriage whether there be <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> about them or not; so that if a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> contract with a <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, whether she <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this or not, there is no marriage; whereas the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of slavery is no impediment if the slavery be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Hence the comparison fails.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 7.</strong> In contracts money is regarded as the measure of other things (Ethic. v, 5), and not as being sought for its own sake. Hence if the coin paid is not what it is thought to be but another of equal value, this does not void the contract. But if there be <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> about a thing sought for its own sake, the contract is voided, for instance if one were to sell a donkey for a horse; and thus it is in the case in point.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 8.</strong> No <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> how long they have cohabited, unless she be willing to consent again, there is no marriage.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 9.</strong> If she did not consent previously to marry his brother, she may hold to the one whom she took in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. Nor can she return to his brother, especially if there has been carnal intercourse between her and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> she took to husband. If, however, she had previously consented to take the first one in words of the present, she cannot have the second while the first lives. But she may either leave the second or return to the first; and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the fact excuses her from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, just as she would be excused if after the consummation of the marriage a kinsman of her husband were to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> her by <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> since she is not to be blamed for the other's deceit.
