<h1>Question 51. The virtues which are connected with prudence</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3051.htm#article1"> Is <em>euboulia</em> a virtue?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3051.htm#article2"> Is it a special virtue, distinct from prudence?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3051.htm#article3"> Is <em>synesis</em> a special virtue?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3051.htm#article4"> Is <em>gnome</em> a special virtue?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether <em>euboulia</em> (deliberating well) is a virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <em>euboulia</em> (deliberating well) is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Lib. Arb. ii, 18,19) "no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> makes <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> use of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>." Now some make <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> use of <em>euboulia</em> (deliberating well) or <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel, either through devising crafty counsels in order to achieve <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> ends, or through committing <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in order that they may achieve <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> ends, as those who rob that they may give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. Therefore <em>euboulia</em> (deliberating well) is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a perfection, according to Phys. vii. But <em>euboulia</em> (deliberating well) is concerned with counsel, which implies <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> and research, and these are marks of imperfection. Therefore <em>euboulia</em> (deliberating well) is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are connected with one another, as stated above (I-II, 65). Now <em>euboulia</em> (deliberating well) is not connected with the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, since many sinners take <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>-counsel, and many godly men are slow in taking counsel. Therefore <em>euboulia</em> (deliberating well) is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vi, 9) <em>euboulia</em> (deliberating well) "is a right counselling." Now the perfection of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> consists in right reason. Therefore <em>euboulia</em> (deliberating well) is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 47, Article 4) the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> consists in making a <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now among the acts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, it is proper to him to take counsel, since this denotes a research of the reason about the actions he has to perform and whereof <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life consists, for the speculative life is above <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as stated in Ethic. x.

<p>But <em>euboulia</em> (deliberating well) signifies <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of counsel, for it is derived from the <em>eu</em>, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and <em>boule</em>, counsel, being "a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel" or rather "a disposition to take <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel." Hence it is evident that <em>euboulia</em> (deliberating well) is a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> There is no <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel either in deliberating for an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> end, or in discovering <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> means for attaining a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> end, even as in speculative matters, there is no <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> reasoning either in coming to a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> conclusion, or in coming to a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> conclusion from <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> premisses through employing an unsuitable middle term. Hence both the aforesaid processes are contrary to <em>euboulia</em> (deliberating well), as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> declares (Ethic. vi, 9).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> a perfection, it does not follow that whatever is the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> implies perfection. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs to be perfected by <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in all his parts, and this not only as regards the acts of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, of which counsel is one, but also as regards the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, which are still more imperfect.

<p>It may also be replied that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a perfection according to the mode of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who is unable by simple insight to comprehend with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of things, especially in matters of action which are <a href="../cathen/04331a.htm">contingent</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In no sinner as such is <em>euboulia</em> (deliberating well) to be found: since all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is contrary to taking <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel. For <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel requires not only the discovery or devising of fit means for the end, but also other circumstances. Such are suitable time, so that one be neither too slow nor too quick in taking counsel, and the mode of taking counsel, so that one be firm in the counsel taken, and other like due circumstances, which sinners fail to observe when they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. On the other hand, every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> takes <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel in those things which are directed to the end of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, although perhaps he does not take <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel in other particular matters, for instance in matters of trade, or warfare, or the like.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether <em>euboulia</em> (deliberating well) is a special virtue, distinct from prudence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <em>euboulia</em> (deliberating well) is not a distinct <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> from <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. For, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vi, 5), the "<a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is, seemingly, one who takes <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel." Now this belongs to <em>euboulia</em> (deliberating well) as stated above. Therefore <em>euboulia</em> (deliberating well) is not distinct from <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> to which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are directed, are specified chiefly by their end, as stated above (I-II, 01, 3; I-II, 18, 4,6). Now <em>euboulia</em> (deliberating well) and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> are directed to the same end, as stated in Ethic. vi, 9, not indeed to some particular end, but to the common end of all life. Therefore <em>euboulia</em> (deliberating well) is not a distinct <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> from <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in speculative <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, research and decision belong to the same science. Therefore in like manner these belong to the same <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in practical matters. Now research belongs to <em>euboulia</em> (deliberating well), while decision belongs to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. There <em>euboulia</em> (deliberating well) is not a distinct <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> from <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">Prudence</a> is preceptive, according to Ethic. vi, 10. But this does not apply to <em>euboulia</em> (deliberating well). Therefore <em>euboulia</em> (deliberating well) is a distinct <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> from <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is properly directed to an act which it renders <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and consequently <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> must differ according to different acts, especially when there is a different kind of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> in the acts. For, if various acts contained the same kind of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, they would belong to the same <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: thus the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of love, desire and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> depends on the same, wherefore all these belong to the same <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p>Now acts of the reason that are ordained to action are diverse, nor have they the same kind of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>: since it is owing to different <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> that a man acquires <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> judgment, or <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> command, inasmuch as these are sometimes separated from one another. Consequently <em>euboulia</em> (deliberating well) which makes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> take <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel must needs be a distinct <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> from <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, which makes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> command well. And since counsel is directed to command as to that which is principal, so <em>euboulia</em> (deliberating well) is directed to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> as to a principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, without which it would be no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> at all, even as neither are the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> without <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, nor the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It belongs to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> to take <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel by commanding it, to <em>euboulia</em> (deliberating well) by eliciting it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Different acts are directed in different degrees to the one end which is "a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> life in general" [Ethic. vi, 5: for counsel comes first, judgment follows, and command comes last. The last named has an immediate relation to the last end: whereas the other two acts are related thereto remotely. Nevertheless these have certain proximate ends of their own, the end of counsel being the discovery of what has to be done, and the end of judgment, <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>. Hence this proves not that <em>euboulia</em> (deliberating well) is not a distinct <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> from <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, but that it is subordinate thereto, as a secondary to a principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Even in speculative matters the rational science of dialectics, which is directed to research and discovery, is distinct from demonstrative science, which decides the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether <em>synesis</em> (judging well according to common law) is a virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <em>synesis</em> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Virtues are not in us by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, according to Ethic. ii, 1. But <em>synesis</em> (judging well according to common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>) is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to some, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. vi, 11). Therefore <em>synesis</em> (judging well according to common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>) is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as stated in the same book (10), <em>synesis</em> (judging well according to common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>) is nothing but "a faculty of judging." But judgment without command can be even in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. Since then <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is only in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it seems that <em>synesis</em> (judging well according to common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>) is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, there is never a defective command, unless there be a defective judgment, at least in a particular <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of action; for it is in this that every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errs</a>. If therefore <em>synesis</em> (judging well according to common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>) be reckoned a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> directed to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> judgment, it seems that there is no need for any other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> directed to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> command: and consequently <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> would be superfluous, which is not reasonable. Therefore <em>synesis</em> (judging well according to common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>) is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Judgment is more perfect than counsel. But <em>euboulia</em>, or <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel, is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Much more, therefore, is <em>synesis</em> (judging well according to common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>) a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as being <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> judgment.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <em>synesis</em> (judging well according to common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>) signifies a right judgment, not indeed about speculative matters, but about particular practical matters, about which also is <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Hence in Greek some, in respect of <em>synesis</em> (judging well according to common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>) are said to be <em>synetoi</em>, i.e. "<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of sense," or <em>eusynetoi</em>, i.e. "men of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> sense," just as on the other hand, those who lack this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are called <em>asynetoi</em>, i.e. "senseless."

<p>Now, different acts which cannot be ascribed to the same <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, must correspond to different <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. And it is evident that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of counsel and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of judgment are not reducible to the same <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, for many can take <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel, without having <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> sense so as to judge well. Even so, in speculative matters some are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> at research, through their reason being quick at arguing from one thing to another (which seems to be due to a disposition of their power of <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, which has a facility in forming phantasms), and yet such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> sometimes lack <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> judgment (and this is due to a defect in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> arising chiefly from a defective disposition of the <a href="../cathen/04167a.htm">common sense</a> which fails to judge aright). Hence there is need, besides <em>euboulia</em> (deliberating well), for another <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which judges well, and this is called <em>synesis</em> (judging well according to common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Right judgment consists in the cognitive power apprehending a thing just as it is in reality, and this is due to the right disposition of the apprehensive power. Thus if a mirror be well disposed the forms of bodies are reflected in it just as they are, whereas if it be ill disposed, the images therein appear distorted and misshapen. Now that the cognitive power be well disposed to receive things just as they are in reality, is radically due to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but, as to its consummation, is due to practice or to a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and this in two ways. First directly, on the part of the cognitive power itself, for instance, because it is imbued, not with distorted, but with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and correct <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>: this belongs to <em>synesis</em> (judging well according to common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>) which in this respect is a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Secondly indirectly, through the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> disposition of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, the result being that one judges well of the objects of <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>: and thus a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> judgment of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> results from the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; but this judgment is about the ends, whereas <em>synesis</em> (judging well according to common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>) is rather about the means.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men there may be right judgment of a universal principle, but their judgment is always corrupt in the particular <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of action, as stated above (Question 47, Article 13).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Sometimes after judging aright we delay to execute or execute negligently or inordinately. Hence after the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which judges aright there is a further need of a final and principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which commands aright, and this is <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether <em>gnome</em> (judging well according to general law) is a special virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <em>gnome</em> (judging well according to general <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>) is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> distinct from <em>synesis</em> (judging well according to common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>). For a man is said, in respect of <em>synesis</em> (judging well according to common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>), to have <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> judgment. Now no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can be said to have <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> judgment, unless he judge aright in all things. Therefore <em>synesis</em> (judging well according to common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>) extends to all matters of judgment, and consequently there is no other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> judgment called <em>gnome</em> (judging well according to general <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>).

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, judgment is midway between counsel and precept. Now there is only one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel, viz. <em>euboulia</em> (deliberating well) and only one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> command, viz. <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Therefore there is only one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> judgment, viz. <em>synesis</em> (judging well according to common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>).

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, rare occurrences wherein there is need to depart from the common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, seem for the most part to happen by chance, and with such things reason is not concerned, as stated in Phys. ii, 5. Now all the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> depend on right reason. Therefore there is no <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> about such matters.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> concludes (Ethic. vi, 11) that <em>gnome</em> (judging well according to general <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>) is a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that</strong> cognitive <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> differ according to higher and lower principles: thus in speculative matters wisdom considers higher principles than science does, and consequently is distinguished from it; and so must it be also in practical matters. Now it is evident that what is beside the order of a lower principle or <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, is sometimes reducible to the order of a higher principle; thus monstrous births of animals are beside the order of the active seminal force, and yet they come under the order of a higher principle, namely, of a heavenly body, or higher still, of Divine Providence. Hence by considering the active seminal force one could not pronounce a sure judgment on such monstrosities, and yet this is possible if we consider Divine Providence.

<p>Now it happens sometimes that something has to be done which is not covered by the common rules of actions, for instance in the case of the enemy of one's country, when it would be wrong to give him back his deposit, or in other similar cases. Hence it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to judge of such matters according to higher principles than the common laws, according to which <em>synesis</em> (judging according to common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>) judges: and corresponding to such higher principles it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to have a higher <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of judgment, which is called <em>gnome</em> (judging according to general <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>), and which denotes a certain discrimination in judgment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <em>Synesis</em> (judging well according to common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>) judges rightly about all actions that are covered by the common rules: but certain things have to be judged beside these common rules, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Judgment about a thing should be formed from the proper principles thereof, whereas research is made by employing also common principles. Wherefore also in speculative matters, dialectics which aims at research proceeds from common principles; while demonstration which tends to judgment, proceeds from proper principles. Hence <em>euboulia</em> (deliberating well) to which the research of counsel belongs is one for all, but not so <em>synesis</em> (judging well according to common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>) whose act is judicial. Command considers in all matters the one aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, wherefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> also is only one.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It belongs to Divine Providence alone to consider all things that may happen beside the common course. On the other hand, among men, he who is most discerning can judge a greater number of such things by his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>: this belongs to <em>gnome</em> (judging well according to general <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>), which denotes a certain discrimination in judgment.
