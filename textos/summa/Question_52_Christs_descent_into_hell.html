<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether it was fitting for Christ to descend into hell?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it was not fitting for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to descend into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, because <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. ad Evod. cliv.): "Nor could I find anywhere in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> mentioned as something <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> did not descend into any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> place, for neither do the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the just. Therefore it does not seem fitting for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to descend into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it cannot belong to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to descend into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> according to His Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, which is altogether immovable; but only according to His assumed <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But that which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did or suffered in His assumed <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is ordained for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: and to secure this it does not seem <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to descend into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, since He delivered us from both guilt and penalty by His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> which He endured in this world, as stated above (49, 1,3). Consequently, it was not fitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should descend into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was separated from His body, and this was laid in the sepulchre, as stated above (<a href="#51">Article 51</a>). But it seems that He descended into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, not according to His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> only, because seemingly the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, being incorporeal, cannot be a subject of local motion; for this belongs to bodies, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in Phys. vi, text. 32; while descent implies corporeal motion. Therefore it was not fitting for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to descend into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said in the Creed: "He descended into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>": and the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse9">Ephesians 4:9</a>): "Now that He <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended</a>, what is it, but because He also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?" And a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> adds: "that is--into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that</strong> It was fitting for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to descend into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. First of all, because He came to bear our penalty in order to free us from penalty, according to <a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse4">Isaiah 53:4</a>: "Surely He hath borne our infirmities and carried our sorrows." But through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had incurred not only the death of the body, but also descent into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. Consequently since it was fitting for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to die in order to deliver us from death, so it was fitting for Him to descend into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> in order to deliver us also from going down into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/hos013.htm#verse14">Hosea 13:14</a>): "O death, I will be thy death; O <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, I will be thy bite." Secondly, because it was fitting when the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> was overthrown by the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should deliver the captives detained in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, according to <a href="../bible/zec009.htm#verse11">Zechariah 9:11</a>: "Thou also by the blood of Thy Testament hast sent forth Thy prisoners out of the pit." And it is written (<a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse15">Colossians 2:15</a>): "Despoiling the principalities and powers, He hath exposed them confidently." Thirdly, that as He showed forth His power on earth by living and dying, so also He might manifest it in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, by visiting it and enlightening it. Accordingly it is written (<a href="../bible/psa023.htm#verse7">Psalm 23:7</a>): "Lift up your gates, O ye princes," which the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> thus interprets: "that is--Ye princes of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, take away your power, whereby hitherto you held men fast in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>"; and so "at the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name of Jesus</a> every knee should bow," not only "of them that are in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>," but likewise "of them that are in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>," as is said in <a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse10">Philippians 2:10</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The name of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> stands for an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of penalty, and not for an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of guilt. Hence it was becoming that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should descend into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, not as liable to punishment Himself, but to deliver them who were.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> was a kind of universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, both of the living and of the dead. But a general <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is applied to particular effects by means of something special. Hence, as the power of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> is applied to the living through the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which make us like unto <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, so likewise it is applied to the dead through His descent into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. On which account it is written (<a href="../bible/zec009.htm#verse11">Zechariah 9:11</a>) that "He sent forth prisoners out of the pit, in the blood of His testament," that is, by the power of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> descended into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> not by the same kind of motion as that whereby bodies are moved, but by that kind whereby the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are moved, as was said in I, 53, 1.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether Christ went down into the hell of the lost?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> went down into the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> of the lost, because it is said by the mouth of Divine Wisdom (<a href="../bible/sir024.htm#verse45">Sirach 24:45</a>): "I will penetrate to all the lower parts of the earth." But the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> of the lost is computed among the lower parts of the earth according to <a href="../bible/psa062.htm#verse10">Psalm 62:10</a>: "They shall go into the lower parts of the earth." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> who is the Wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, went down even into the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> of the lost.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, Peter says (<a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse24">Acts 2:24</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath raised up <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, having loosed the sorrows of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, as it was impossible that He should be holden by it." But there are no sorrows in the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> of the Fathers, nor in the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> of the children, since they are not punished with sensible pain on account of any actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but only with the pain of loss on account of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> went down into the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> of the lost, or else into <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>, where men are tormented with sensible pain on account of actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/1pe003.htm#verse19">1 Peter 3:19</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> coming in spirit preached to those spirits that were in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, which had some time been incredulous": and this is understood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> descent into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> says (Ep. ad Epict.). For he says that "Christ's body was laid in the sepulchre when He went to preach to those spirits who were in bondage, as Peter said." But it is clear the unbelievers were in the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> of the lost. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> went down into the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> of the lost.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. ad Evod. clxiv): "If the <a href="../bible/index.html">sacred Scriptures</a> had said that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> came into <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom, without naming <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> or its woes, I wonder whether any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> would dare to assert that He descended into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. But since evident testimonies mention <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> and its sorrows, there is no reason for <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> went there except to deliver men from the same woes." But the place of woes is the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> of the lost. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> descended into the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> of the lost.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a sermon upon the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>: <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> descending into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> "set free all the just who were held in the bonds of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>." But among them was <a href="../cathen/08413a.htm">Job</a>, who says of himself (<a href="../bible/job017.htm#verse16">Job 17:16</a>): "All that I have shall go down into the deepest pit." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> descended into the deepest pit.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Regarding the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> of the lost it is written (<a href="../bible/job010.htm#verse21">Job 10:21</a>): "Before I go, and return no more, to a land that is dark and covered with the mist of death." Now there is no "fellowship of light with darkness," according to <a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse14">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who is "the light," did not descend into the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> of the lost.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing is said to be in a place in two ways. First of all, through its effect, and in this way <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> descended into each of the hells, but in different manner. For going down into the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> of the lost He wrought this effect, that by descending thither He put them to shame for their unbelief and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>: but to them who were detained in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> He gave hope of attaining to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: while upon the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers detained in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> solely on account of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, He shed the light of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> everlasting.

<p>In another way a thing is said to be in a place through its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>: and in this way <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> descended only into that part of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> wherein the just were detained. so that He visited them "in place," according to His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, whom He visited "interiorly by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>," according to His Godhead. Accordingly, while remaining in one part of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, He wrought this effect in a measure in every part of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, just as while suffering in one part of the earth He delivered the whole world by His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who is the Wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, penetrated to all the lower parts of the earth, not passing through them locally with His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but by spreading the effects of His power in a measure to them all: yet so that He enlightened only the just: because the text quoted continues: "And I will enlighten all that hope in the Lord."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Sorrow is twofold: one is the suffering of pain which men endure for actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa017.htm#verse6">Psalm 17:6</a>: "The sorrows of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> encompassed me." Another sorrow comes of hoped-for <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> being deferred, according to <a href="../bible/pro013.htm#verse12">Proverbs 13:12</a>: "Hope that is deferred afflicteth the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>": and such was the sorrow which the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers suffered in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> refers to it in a sermon on the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, saying that "they besought <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> with tearful entreaty." Now by descending into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> took away both sorrows, yet in different ways: for He did away with the sorrows of pains by preserving <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> from them, just as a physician is said to free a man from sickness by warding it off by means of physic. Likewise He removed the sorrows <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> deferred, by bestowing <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> These words of Peter are referred by some to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> descent into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>: and they explain it in this sense: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> preached to them who formerly were unbelievers, and who were shut up in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>"--that is, in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>--"in spirit"--that is, by His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii): "As He evangelized them who are upon the earth, so did He those who were in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>"; not in order to convert unbelievers unto <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, but to put them to shame for their unbelief, since preaching cannot be understood otherwise than as the open manifesting of His Godhead. which was laid bare before them in the lower regions by His descending in power into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, however, furnishes a better exposition of the text in his Epistle to Evodius quoted above, namely, that the preaching is not to be referred to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> descent into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, but to the operation of His Godhead, to which He gave effect from the beginning of the world. Consequently, the sense is, that "to those (spirits) that were in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>"--that is, living in the mortal body, which is, as it were, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> prison-house--"by the spirit" of His Godhead "He came and preached" by internal inspirations, and from without by the admonitions spoken by the righteous: to those, I say, He preached "which had been some time incredulous," i.e. not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> in the preaching of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, "when they waited for the patience of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," whereby the chastisement of the <a href="../cathen/04702a.htm">Deluge</a> was put off: accordingly (Peter) adds: "In the days of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/01720a.htm">Ark</a> was being built."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The expression "<a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom" may be taken in two senses. First of all, as implying that restfulness, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> there, from sensible pain; so that in this sense it cannot be called <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, nor are there any sorrows there. In another way it can be taken as implying the privation of longed-for <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: in this sense it has the character of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> and sorrow. Consequently, that rest of the blessed is now called <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom, yet it is not styled <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, nor are sorrows said to be now in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xiii): "Even the higher regions of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> he calls the deepest <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> . . . For if relatively to the height of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> this darksome air is infernal, then relatively to the height of this same air the earth lying beneath can be considered as infernal and deep. And again in comparison with the height of the same earth, those parts of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> which are higher than the other infernal mansions, may in this way be designated as the deepest <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the whole Christ was in hell?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the whole <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is one of His parts. But His body was not in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. Therefore, the whole <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, nothing can be termed whole when its parts are severed. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, which are the parts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, were separated at His death, as stated above (50, 3,4), and it was after death that He descended into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. Therefore the whole (Christ) could not be in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the whole of a thing is said to be in a place when no part of it is outside such place. But there were parts of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> outside <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>; for instance, His body was in the grave, and His Godhead everywhere. Therefore the whole <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Symbolo iii): "The whole Son is with the Father, the whole Son in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, on earth, in the Virgin's womb, on the Cross, in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, in paradise, into which He brought the robber."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is evident from what was said in I, 31, 2, ad 4, the masculine gender is referred to the hypostasis or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, while the neuter belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now in the death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, although the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was separated from the body, yet neither was separated from the Person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, as stated above (Question 50, Article 2). Consequently, it must be affirmed that during the three days of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death the whole <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was in the tomb, because the whole Person was there through the body united with Him, and likewise He was entirely in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, because the whole Person of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was there by reason of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> united with Him, and the whole <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was then everywhere by reason of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The body which was then in the grave is not a part of the uncreated Person, but of the assumed <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Consequently, the fact of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body not being in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> does not prevent the whole <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> from being there: but proves that not everything appertaining to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was there.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is made up of the united <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body; not so the Divine Person. Consequently when death severed the union of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with the body, the whole <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> remained, but His whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> did not remain.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Person is whole in each single place, but not wholly, because it is not circumscribed by any place: indeed, all places put together could not comprise His immensity; rather is it His immensity that embraces all things. But it happens in those things which are in a place corporeally and circumscriptively, that if a whole be in some place, then no part of it is outside that place. But this is not the case with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Symbolo iii): "It is not according to times or places that we say that the whole <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is everywhere, as if He were at one time whole in one place, at another time whole in another: but as being whole always and everywhere."

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether Christ made any stay in hell?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not make any stay in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> went down into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> to deliver men from thence. But He accomplished this deliverance at once by His descent, for, according to <a href="../bible/sir011.htm#verse23">Sirach 11:23</a>: "It is easy in the eyes of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on a sudden to make the poor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> rich." Consequently He does not seem to have tarried in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a sermon on the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> (clx) that "of a sudden at <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> and Saviour's bidding all 'the bars of iron were burst'" (Cf. <a href="../bible/isa045.htm#verse2">Isaiah 45:2</a>). Hence on behalf of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> accompanying <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> it is written (<a href="../bible/psa023.htm#verse7">Psalm 23:7-9</a>): "Lift up your gates, O ye princes." Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> descended thither in order to break the bolts of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. Therefore He did not make any stay in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is related (<a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse43">Luke 23:43</a>) that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> while hanging on the cross said to the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a>: "This day thou shalt be with Me in paradise": from which it is evident that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was in paradise on that very day. But He was not there with His body. for that was in the grave. Therefore He was there with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which had gone down into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>: and consequently it appears that He made no stay in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Peter says (<a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse24">Acts 2:24</a>): "Whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath raised up, having loosed the sorrows of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, as it was impossible that He should be held by it." Therefore it seems that He remained in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> until the hour of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in order to take our penalties upon Himself, willed His body to be laid in the tomb, so likewise He willed His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to descend into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. But the body lay in the tomb for a day and two nights, so as to demonstrate the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of His death. Consequently, it is to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, in order that it might be brought back out of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> simultaneously with His body from the tomb.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> When <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> descended into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> He delivered the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who were there, not by leading them out at once from the confines of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, but by enlightening them with the light of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> itself. Nevertheless it was fitting that His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> should abide in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> as long as His body remained in the tomb.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> By the expression "bars of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>" are understood the obstacles which kept the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers from quitting <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, through the guilt of our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and these bars <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> burst asunder by the power of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> on descending into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>: nevertheless He chose to remain in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> for some time, for the reason stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> expression is not to be understood of the earthly corporeal paradise, but of a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> one, in which all are said to be who enjoy the Divine <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Accordingly, the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a> descended locally into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, because it was said to him: "This day thou shalt be with Me in paradise"; still as to reward he was in paradise, because he enjoyed <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Godhead just as the other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> did.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether Christ descending into hell delivered the holy Fathers from thence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> descending into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> did not deliver the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers from thence. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Epist. ad Evod. clxiv) says: "I have not yet discovered what <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> descending into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> bestowed upon those righteous ones who were in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom, from whom I fail to see that He ever departed according to the beatific presence of His Godhead." But had He delivered them, He would have bestowed much upon them. Therefore it does not appear that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> delivered the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers from <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no one is detained in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> except on account of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But during life the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers were justified from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Consequently they did not need to be delivered from <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> descent thither.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if you remove the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, you remove the effect. But that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> went down into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> was due to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which was taken away by the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, as stated above (Question 49, Article 1). Consequently, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers were not delivered on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> descent into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in the sermon on the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> already quoted that when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> descended into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> "He broke down the gate and 'iron bars' of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, setting at liberty all the righteous who were held fast through <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (4, ad 2), when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> descended into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> He worked through the power of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. But through <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> was delivered not only from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but also from the debt of its penalty, as stated above (49, 1,3). Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were held fast by the debt of punishment in two ways: first of all for actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which each had committed personally: secondly, for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, which each one in his origin contracts from our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a>, as stated in <a href="../bible/rom005.htm">Romans 5</a> of which <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> the penalty is the death of the body as well as exclusion from <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, as is evident from <a href="../bible/gen002.htm">Genesis 2</a> and <a href="../bible/gen013.htm">3</a>: because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cast out <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from paradise after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, having beforehand threatened him with death should he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Consequently, when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> descended into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, by the power of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> He delivered the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> from the penalty whereby they were excluded from the life of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, so as to be unable to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His Essence, wherein <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> beatitude lies, as stated in the I-II, 3, 8. But the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers were detained in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> for the reason, that, owing to our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the approach to the life of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> was not opened. And so when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> descended into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> He delivered the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers from thence. And this is what is written <a href="../bible/zec009.htm#verse11">Zechariah 9:11</a>: "Thou also by the blood of Thy testament hast sent forth Thy prisoners out of the pit, wherein is no water." And (<a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse15">Colossians 2:15</a>) it is written that "despoiling the principalities and powers," i.e. "of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, by taking out <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> and <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, and the other just <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>," "He led them," i.e. "He brought them far from this kingdom of darkness into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>," as the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> explains.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is speaking there against such as maintained that the righteous of old were subject to penal sufferings before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> descent into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. Hence shortly before the passage quoted he says: "Some add that this benefit was also bestowed upon the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of old, that on the Lord's coming into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> they were freed from their sufferings. But I fail to see how <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, into whose bosom the poor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was received, was ever in such sufferings." Consequently, when he afterwards adds that "he had not yet discovered what <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> descent into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> had brought to the righteous of old," this must be understood as to their being freed from penal sufferings. Yet <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> bestowed something upon them as to their attaining <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: and in consequence He dispelled the suffering which they endured through their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> being delayed: still they had great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> from the very hope thereof, according to <a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse56">John 8:56</a>: "<a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> your father rejoiced that he might see my day." And therefore he adds: "I fail to see that He ever departed, according to the beatific presence of His Godhead," that is, inasmuch as even before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> coming they were <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> in hope, although not yet fully <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> in fact.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers while yet living were delivered from original as well as actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; also from the penalty of actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but not from the penalty of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, whereby they were excluded from <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, since the price of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> redemption was not yet paid: just as the faithful are now delivered by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> from the penalty of actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and from the penalty of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> as to exclusion from <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, yet still remain bound by the penalty of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> as to the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of dying in the body because they are renewed in the spirit, but not yet in the flesh, according to <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse10">Romans 8:10</a>: "The body indeed is dead, because of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but the spirit liveth, because of <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Directly Christ died His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> went down into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, and bestowed the fruits of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> on the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> detained there; although they did not go out as long as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> remained in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, because His presence was part of the fulness of their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether Christ delivered any of the lost from hell?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did deliver some of the lost from <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, because it is written (<a href="../bible/isa024.htm#verse22">Isaiah 24:22</a>): "And they shall be gathered together as in the gathering of one bundle into the pit, end they shall be shut up there in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>: and after many days they shall be visited." But there he is speaking of the lost, who "had <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> the host of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>," according to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome's</a> commentary. Consequently it seems that even the lost were visited at <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> descent into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>; and this seems to imply their deliverance.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, on <a href="../bible/zec009.htm#verse11">Zechariah 9:11</a>: "Thou also by the blood of Thy testament hast sent forth Thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water," the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> observes: "Thou hast delivered them who were held bound in prisons, where no mercy refreshed them, which that rich <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for." But only the lost are shut up in merciless prisons. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did deliver some from the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> of the lost.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> power was not less in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> than in this world, because He worked in every place by the power of His Godhead. But in this world He delivered some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of every state. Therefore, in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> also, He delivered some from the state of the lost.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/hos013.htm#verse14">Hosea 13:14</a>): "O death, I will be thy death; O <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, I will be thy bite": upon which the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "By leading forth the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>, and leaving there the reprobate." But only the reprobate are in the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> of the lost. Therefore, by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> descent into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> none were delivered from the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> of the lost.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>), when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> descended into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> He worked by the power of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. Consequently, His descent into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> brought the fruits of deliverance to them only who were united to His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> quickened by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, whereby <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are taken away. Now those detained in the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> of the lost either had no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, as infidels; or if they had <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, they had no conformity with the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of the suffering Christ: hence they could not be cleansed from their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. And on this account <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> descent into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> brought them no deliverance from the debt of punishment in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> When <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> descended into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, all who were in any part of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> were visited in some respect: some to their consolation and deliverance, others, namely, the lost, to their shame and confusion. Accordingly the passage continues: "And the moon shall blush, and the sun be put to shame," etc.

<p>This can also be referred to the visitation which will come upon them in the Day of Judgment, not for their deliverance, but for their yet greater confusion, according to <a href="../bible/zep001.htm#verse12">Zephaniah 1:12</a>: "I will visit upon the men that are settled on their lees."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says "where no mercy refreshed them," this is to be understood of the refreshing of full deliverance, because the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers could not be delivered from this <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> coming.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It was not due to any lack of power on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> part that some were not delivered from every state in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, as out of every state among men in this world; but it was owing to the very different <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of each state. For, so long as men live here below, they can be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, because in this life men are not confirmed either in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as they are after quitting this life.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the children who died in original sin were delivered by Christ?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the children who died in <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> were delivered from <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> descending thither. For, like the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers, the children were kept in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> simply because of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers were delivered from <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, as stated above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>). Therefore the children were similarly delivered from <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse15">Romans 5:15</a>): "If by the offense of one, many died; much more the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, hath abounded unto many." But the children who die with none but <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> are detained in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> owing to their <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore, much more were they delivered from <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> works in virtue of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, so also does <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> descent into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, as is clear from what has been said (4, ad 2, 5,6). But through <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> children are delivered from <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> and <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. Therefore, they were similarly delivered by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> descent into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse25">Romans 3:25</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath proposed <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be a propitiation, through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in His blood." But the children who had died with only <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> were in no wise sharers of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore, they did not receive the fruits of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> propitiation, so as to be delivered by Him from <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#6">Article 6</a>), <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> descent into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> had its effect of deliverance on them only who through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> were united to <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> whereof <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> descent into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> was one of deliverance. But the children who had died in <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> were in no way united to <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and love: for, not having the use of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, they could have no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of their own; nor were they cleansed from <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> either by their parents' <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or by any sacrament of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Consequently, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> descent into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> did not deliver the children from thence. And furthermore, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers were delivered from <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> by being admitted to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a>, to which no one can come except through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; according to <a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse23">Romans 6:23</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is life everlasting." Therefore, since children dying in <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> had no <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, they were not delivered from <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers, although still held bound by the debt of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, in so far as it touches <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, were nevertheless delivered from all stain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: consequently, they were capable of that deliverance which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> brought by descending into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. But the same cannot be said of the children, as is evident from what was said above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "hath abounded unto many," the word "many" [The <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> reads 'plures,' i.e. 'many more'] is to be taken, not comparatively, as if more were saved by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> than lost by <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: but absolutely, as if he said that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> abounded unto many, just as <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was contracted by many. But as <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was contracted by those only who descended seminally from him according to the flesh, so <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> reached those only who became His members by <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> regeneration: which does not apply to children dying in <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is applied to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in this life, in which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> state can be changed from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> into <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: but <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> descent into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> was vouchsafed to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> after this life when they are no longer capable of the said change. And consequently by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> children are delivered from <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> and from <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, but not by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> descent into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether Christ by His descent into hell delivered souls from purgatory?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by His descent into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> delivered <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> from <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>--for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. ad Evod. clxiv): "Because evident testimonies speak of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> and its pains, there is no reason for <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> that the Saviour came thither except to rescue men from those same pains: but I still wish to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether it was all whom He found there, or some whom He deemed worthy of such a benefit. Yet I do not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> went into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, and granted this favor to them who were suffering from its pains." But, as stated above (<a href="#6">Article 6</a>), He did not confer the benefit of deliverance upon the lost: and there are no others in a state of penal suffering except those in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>. Consequently <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> delivered <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> from <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the very presence of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> had no less effect than His <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> have. But <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are delivered from <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> by the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, especially by the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, as shall be shown later (XP, 71, 9). Therefore much more were <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> delivered from <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> by the presence of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> descending into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Poenit. ix), those whom <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> healed in this life He healed completely. Also, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> says (<a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse23">John 7:23</a>): "I have healed the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath-day</a>." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> delivered them who were in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> from the punishment of the pain of loss, whereby they were excluded from <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Therefore, He also delivered them from the punishment of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xiii): "Since our Creator and Redeemer, penetrating the bars of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, brought out from thence the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>, He does not permit us to go thither, from whence He has already by descending set others free." But He permits us to go to <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>. Therefore, by descending into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, He did not deliver <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> from <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As we have stated more than once (4, ad 2, 5,6,7), <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> descent into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> was one of deliverance in virtue of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> had a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which was neither temporal nor transitory, but everlasting, according to <a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse14">Hebrews 10:14</a>: "For by one oblation He hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified." And so it is evident that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> had no greater efficacy then than it has now. Consequently, they who were such as those who are now in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>, were not set free from <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> descent into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. But if any were found such as are now set free from <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> by virtue of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, then there was nothing to hinder them from being delivered from <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> descent into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> From this passage of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> it cannot be concluded that all who were in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> were delivered from it, but that such a benefit was bestowed upon some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, that is to say, upon such as were already cleansed sufficiently, or who in life, by their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and devotion towards <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death, so <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a>, that when He descended, they were delivered from the temporal punishment of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> power operates in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> by way of healing and expiation. Consequently, the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> delivers men from <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> inasmuch as it is a satisfactory sacrifice for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> descent into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> was not satisfactory; yet it operated in virtue of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, which was satisfactory, as stated above (Question 48, Article 2), but satisfactory in general, since its <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> had to be applied to each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> by something specially personal (49, 1, ad 4,5). Consequently, it does not follow of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> that all were delivered from <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> descent into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Those defects from which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> altogether delivered men in this world were purely personal, and concerned the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>; whereas exclusion from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> was a general defect and common to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Consequently, there was nothing to prevent those detained in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> being delivered by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> from their privation of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, but not from the debt of punishment in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> which pertains to personal defect. Just as on the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> coming were delivered from their personal defects, but not from the common defect, as was stated above (7, ad 1; 49, 5, ad 1).
