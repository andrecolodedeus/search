<h1>Question 52. The angels in relation to place</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1052.htm#article1"> Is the angel in a place?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1052.htm#article2"> Can he be in several places at once?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1052.htm#article3"> Can several angels be in the same place?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether an angel is in a place?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is not in a place. For <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Hebdom.): "The common opinion of the learned is that things incorporeal are not in a place." And again, <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> observes (Phys. iv, text 48,57) that "it is not everything <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> which is in a place, but only a movable body." But an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is not a body, as was shown above (<a href="#50">Article 50</a>). Therefore an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is not in a place.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, place is a "<a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> having position." But everything which is in a place has some position. Now to have a position cannot benefit an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, since his <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is devoid of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, the proper difference of which is to have a position. Therefore an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is not in a place.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to be in a place is to be measured and to be contained by such place, as is evident from the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Phys. iv, text 14,119). But an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can neither be measured nor contained by a place, because the container is more formal than the contained; as air with regard to water (Phys. iv, text 35,49). Therefore an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is not in a place.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said in the <a href="../cathen/04103a.htm">Collect</a> [<a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> at Compline, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>]: "Let Thy <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who dwell herein, keep us in peace."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is befitting an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to be in a place; yet an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> and a body are said to be in a place in quite a different sense. A body is said to be in a place in such a way that it is applied to such place according to the contact of dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>; but there is no such <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, for theirs is a virtual one. Consequently an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is said to be in a corporeal place by application of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> power in any manner whatever to any place.

<p>Accordingly there is no need for saying that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can be deemed commensurate with a place, or that he occupies a space in the continuous; for this is proper to a located body which is endowed with dimensive <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. In similar fashion it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> on this account for the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to be contained by a place; because an incorporeal <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> virtually contains the thing with which it comes into contact, and is not contained by it: for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is in the body as containing it, not as contained by it. In the same way an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is said to be in a place which is corporeal, not as the thing contained, but as somehow containing it.

<p>And hereby we have the answers to the objections.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether an angel can be in several places at once?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can be in several places at once. For an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is not less endowed with power than the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is in several places at once, for it is entirely in every part of the body, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. vi). Therefore an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can be in several places at once.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is in the body which he assumes; and, since the body which he assumes is continuous, it would appear that he is in every part thereof. But according to the various parts there are various places. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is at one time in various places.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii) that "where the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> operates, there he is." But occasionally he operates in several places at one time, as is evident from the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> destroying Sodom (<a href="../bible/gen019.htm#verse25">Genesis 19:25</a>). Therefore an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can be in several places at the one time.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii) that "while the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, they are not on earth."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> An <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> power and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> are finite, whereas the Divine power and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, which is the universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all things, is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>: consequently <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through His power touches all things, and is not merely present in some places, but is everywhere. Now since the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> power is finite, it does not extend to all things, but to one determined thing. For whatever is compared with one power must be compared therewith as one determined thing. Consequently since all being is compared as one thing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> universal power, so is one particular being compared as one with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> power. Hence, since the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is in a place by the application of his power to the place, it follows that he is not everywhere, nor in several places, but in only one place.

<p>Some, however, have been deceived in this matter. For some who were unable to go beyond the reach of their imaginations supposed the indivisibility of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to be like that of a point; consequently they thought that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> could be only in a place which is a point. But they were manifestly deceived, because a point is something indivisible, yet having its situation; whereas the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is indivisible, and beyond the genus of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> and situation. Consequently there is no occasion for determining in his regard one indivisible place as to situation: any place which is either divisible or indivisible, great or small suffices, according as to his own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> he applies his power to a great or to a small body. So the entire body to which he is applied by his power, corresponds as one place to him.

<p>Neither, if any <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> moves the heavens, is it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for him to be everywhere. First of all, because his power is applied only to what is first moved by him. Now there is one part of the heavens in which there is movement first of all, namely, the part to the east: hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Phys. vii, text 84) attributes the power of the heavenly mover to the part which is in the east. Secondly, because <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> do not hold that one separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> moves all the spheres immediately. Hence it need not be everywhere.

<p>So, then, it is evident that to be in a place appertains quite differently to a body, to an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For a body is in a place in a circumscribed fashion, since it is measured by the place. An <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, however, is not there in a circumscribed fashion, since he is not measured by the place, but definitively, because he is in a place in such a manner that he is not in another. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is neither circumscriptively nor definitively there, because He is everywhere.

<p>From this we can easily gather an answer to the objections: because the entire subject to which the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> power is immediately applied, is reputed as one place, even though it be continuous.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether several angels can be at the same time in the same place?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that several <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> can be at the same time in the same place. For several bodies cannot be at the same time in the same place, because they fill the place. But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not fill a place, because only a body fills a place, so that it be not empty, as appears from the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Phys. iv, text 52,58). Therefore several <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> can be in the one place.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, there is a greater difference between an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> and a body than there is between two <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. But an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> and a body are at the one time in the one place: because there is no place which is not filled with a sensible body, as we find <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in Phys. iv, text. 58. Much more, then, can two <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> be in the same place.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is in every part of the body, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. vi). But <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, although they do not obsess <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, do obsess bodies occasionally; and thus the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> are at the one time in the same place; and consequently for the same reason all other <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> There are not two <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in the same body. Therefore for a like reason there are not two <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in the same place.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There are not two <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in the same place. The reason of this is because it is impossible for two complete <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> to be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> immediately of one and the same thing. This is evident in every class of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>: for there is one proximate form of one thing, and there is one proximate mover, although there may be several remote movers. Nor can it be objected that several <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> may row a boat, since no one of them is a perfect mover, because no one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> strength is sufficient for moving the boat; while all together are as one mover, in so far as their united strengths all combine in producing the one movement. Hence, since the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is said to be in one place by the fact that his power touches the place immediately by way of a perfect container, as was said (1), there can be but one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> in one place.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Several <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are not hindered from being in the same place because of their filling the place; but for another reason, as has been said.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> An <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> and a body are not in a place in the same way; hence the conclusion does not follow.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Not even a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> and a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are compared to a body according to the same relation of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>; since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> is not. Hence the inference does not follow.
