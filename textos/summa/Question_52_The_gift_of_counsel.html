<h1>Question 52. The gift of counsel</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3052.htm#article1"> Should counsel be reckoned among the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3052.htm#article2"> Does the gift of counsel correspond to prudence?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3052.htm#article3"> Does the gift of counsel remain in heaven?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3052.htm#article4"> Does the fifth beatitude, "Blessed are the merciful," etc. correspond to the gift of counsel?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether counsel should be reckoned among the gifts of the Holy Ghost?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that counsel should not be reckoned among the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are given as a help to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. ii, 49). Now for the purpose of taking counsel, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is sufficiently perfected by the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, or even of <em>euboulia</em> (deliberating well), as is evident from what has been said (47, 1, ad 2; 51, 1,2). Therefore counsel should not be reckoned among the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the difference between the seven <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and the gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> seems to be that the latter are not given to all, but are divided among various people, whereas the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are given to all who have the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. But counsel seems to be one of those things which are given by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> specially to certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1ma002.htm#verse65">1 Maccabees 2:65</a>: "Behold . . . your brother Simon is a man of counsel." Therefore counsel should be numbered among the gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> rather than among the seven <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse14">Romans 8:14</a>): "Whosoever are led by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, they are the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." But counselling is not consistent with being led by another. Since then the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are most befitting the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who "have received the spirit of adoption of sons," it would seem that counsel should not be numbered among the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse2">Isaiah 11:2</a>): "(The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a>) shall rest upon him . . . the spirit of counsel, and of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (I-II, 68, 1), the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are dispositions whereby the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is rendered amenable to the motion of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> moves everything according to the mode of the thing moved: thus He moves the corporeal creature through time and place, and the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> creature through time, but not through place, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> declares (Gen. ad lit. viii, 20,22). Again, it is proper to the rational creature to be moved through the research of reason to perform any particular action, and this research is called counsel. Hence the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is said to move the rational creature by way of counsel, wherefore counsel is reckoned among the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">Prudence</a> or <em>euboulia</em> (deliberating well), whether acquired or infused, directs <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the research of counsel according to principles that the reason can grasp; hence <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> or <em>euboulia</em> (deliberating well) makes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> take <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel either for himself or for another. Since, however, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> is unable to grasp the singular and contingent things which may occur, the result is that "the thoughts of mortal men are fearful, and our counsels uncertain" (<a href="../bible/wis009.htm#verse14">Wisdom 9:14</a>). Hence in the research of counsel, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> requires to be directed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who comprehends all things: and this is done through the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of counsel, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is directed as though counseled by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, just as, in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, those who are unable to take counsel for themselves, seek counsel from those who are wiser.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> That a man be of such <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel as to counsel others, may be due to a gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; but that a man be counselled by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as to what he ought to do in matters <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is common to all <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are moved by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> according to their mode, without prejudice to their <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> which is the "faculty of will and reason" [Sent. iii, D, 24]. Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of counsel is befitting the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in so far as the reason is instructed by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> about what we have to do.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the gift of counsel corresponds to the virtue of prudence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of counsel does not fittingly correspond to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. For "the highest point of that which is underneath touches that which is above," as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> observes (Div. Nom. vii), even as a man comes into contact with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> in respect of his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Now cardinal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are inferior to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, as stated above (I-II, 68, 8). Since, then, counsel is the first and lowest act of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, while command is its highest act, and judgment comes between, it seems that the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> corresponding to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is not counsel, but rather a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of judgment or command.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, one <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> suffices to help one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since the higher a thing is the more one it is, as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in De Causis. Now <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is helped by the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which is not only speculative but also practical, as shown above (Question 9, Article 3). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of counsel does not correspond to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it belongs properly to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> to direct, as stated above (Question 47, Article 8). But it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of counsel that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be directed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of counsel does not correspond to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of counsel is about what has to be done for the sake of the end. Now <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is about the same <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Therefore they correspond to one another.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A lower principle of movement is helped chiefly, and is perfected through being moved by a higher principle of movement, as a body through being moved by a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>. Now it is evident that the rectitude of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> is compared to the Divine <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason</a>, as a lower motive principle to a higher: for the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">Eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason</a> is the supreme rule of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> rectitude. Consequently <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, which denotes rectitude of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, is chiefly perfected and helped through being ruled and moved by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and this belongs to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of counsel, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of counsel corresponds to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, as helping and perfecting it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> To judge and command belongs not to the thing moved, but to the mover. Wherefore, since in the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, the position of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind is of one moved rather than of a mover, as stated above (1; I-II, 68, 1), it follows that it would be unfitting to call the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> corresponding to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> by the name of command or judgment rather than of counsel whereby it is possible to signify that the counselled mind is moved by another counselling it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> does not directly correspond to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, since it deals with speculative matters: yet by a kind of extension it helps it. On the other hand the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of counsel corresponds to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> directly, because it is concerned about the same things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The mover that is moved, moves through being moved. Hence the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind, from the very fact that it is directed by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, is enabled to direct itself and others.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the gift of counsel remains in heaven?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of counsel does not remain in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. For counsel is about what has to be done for the sake of an end. But in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> nothing will have to be done for the sake of an end, since there <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> possesses the last end. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of counsel is not in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, counsel implies <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, for it is absurd to take counsel in matters that are evident, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> observes (Ethic. iii, 3). Now all <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> will cease in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Therefore there is no counsel in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> are most conformed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse2">1 John 3:2</a>, "When He shall appear, we shall be like to Him."

<p>But counsel is not becoming to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse34">Romans 11:34</a>, "Who hath been His counsellor?" Therefore neither to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of counsel becoming.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xvii, 12): "When either the guilt or the righteousness of each nation is brought into the debate of the heavenly Court, the guardian of that nation is said to have won in the conflict, or not to have won."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (2; I-II, 68, 1), the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are connected with the motion of the rational creature by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now we must observe two points concerning the motion of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. First, that the disposition of that which is moved, differs while it is being moved from its disposition when it is in the term of movement. Indeed if the mover is the principle of the movement alone, when the movement ceases, the action of the mover ceases as regards the thing moved, since it has already reached the term of movement, even as a house, after it is built, ceases being built by the builder. On the other hand, when the mover is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> not only of the movement, but also of the form to which the movement tends, then the action of the mover does not cease even after the form has been attained: thus the sun lightens the air even after it is lightened. On this way, then, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> in us <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, not only when we first acquire them, but also as long as we persevere in them: and it is thus that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> in the blessed a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of what is to be done, not as though they were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, but by continuing that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in them.

<p>Nevertheless there are things which the blessed, whether <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> or men, do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>: such things are not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to blessedness, but concern the government of things according to Divine Providence. As regards these, we must make a further observation, namely, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> moves the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the blessed in one way, and the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the wayfarer, in another. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> moves the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the wayfarer in matters of action, by soothing the pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> anxiety of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>; whereas there is simple nescience in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the blessed as regards the things they do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. From this nescience the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> mind is cleansed, according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Coel. Hier. vii), nor does there precede in them any research of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, for they simply turn to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and this is to take counsel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. v, 19) "the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> take counsel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> about things beneath them": wherefore the instruction which they receive from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in such matters is called "counsel."

<p>Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of counsel is in the blessed, in so far as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> preserves in them the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that they have, and enlightens them in their nescience of what has to be done.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Even in the blessed there are acts directed to an end, or resulting, as it were, from their attainment of the end, such as the acts of praising <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or of helping on others to the end which they themselves have attained, for example the ministrations of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. On this respect the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of counsel finds a place in them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">Doubt</a> belongs to counsel according to the present state of life, but not to that counsel which takes place in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Even so neither have the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> quite the same acts in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> as on the way thither.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Counsel is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not as receiving but as giving it: and the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> are conformed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as receivers to the source whence they receive.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the fifth beatitude, which is that of mercy, corresponds to the gift of counsel?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the fifth beatitude, which is that of mercy, does not correspond to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of counsel. For all the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> are acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated above (I-II, 69, 1). Now we are directed by counsel in all acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore the fifth beatitude does not correspond more than any other to counsel.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, precepts are given about matters <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, while counsel is given about matters which are not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Now mercy is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, according to <a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse13">James 2:13</a>, "Judgment without mercy to him that hath not done mercy." On the other hand <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, but belongs to the life of perfection, according to <a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse21">Matthew 19:21</a>. Therefore the beatitude of <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> corresponds to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of counsel, rather than to the beatitude of mercy.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the fruits result from the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a>, for they denote a certain <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> delight resulting from perfect acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now none of the fruits correspond to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of counsel, as appears from <a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse22">Galatians 5:22-23</a>. Therefore neither does the beatitude of mercy correspond to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of counsel.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Serm. Dom. iv): "Counsel is befitting the merciful, because the one remedy is to be delivered from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> so great, to pardon, and to give."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Counsel is properly about things useful for an end. Hence such things as are of most use for an end, should above all correspond to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of counsel. Now such is mercy, according to <a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse8">1 Timothy 4:8</a>, "<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">Godliness</a> ['Pietas,' which our English word 'pity,' which is the same as mercy; see note on II-II, 30, 1 is profitable to all things." Therefore the beatitude of mercy specially corresponds to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of counsel, not as eliciting but as directing mercy.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although counsel directs in all the acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, it does so in a special way in <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">works of mercy</a>, for the reason given above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Counsel considered as a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> guides us in all matters that are directed to the end of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> whether they be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> or not, and yet not every work of mercy is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Fruit denotes something ultimate. Now the ultimate in practical matters consists not in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> but in an action which is the end. Hence nothing pertaining to practical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is numbered among the fruits, but only such things as pertain to action, in which practical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is the guide. Among these we find "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>" and "benignity" which correspond to mercy.
