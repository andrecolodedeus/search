<h1>Question 52. The impediment of the condition of slavery</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5052.htm#article1"> Is the condition of slavery an impediment to Matrimony?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5052.htm#article2"> Can a slave marry without his master's consent?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5052.htm#article3"> Can a man who is already married make himself a slave without his wife's consent?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5052.htm#article4"> Should the children follow the condition of their father or of their mother?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the condition of slavery is an impediment to matrimony?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of slavery is no impediment to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>. For nothing is an impediment to marriage except what is in some way opposed to it. But slavery is in no way opposed to marriage, else there could be no marriage among slaves. Therefore slavery is no impediment to marriage.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which is contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> cannot be an impediment to that which is according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now slavery is contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, for as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Pastor. ii, 6), "it is contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to wish to lord it over another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>"; and this is also evident from the fact that it was said of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis 1:26</a>) that he should "have dominion over the fishes of the sea," but not that he should have dominion over <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore it cannot be an impediment to marriage, which is a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> thing.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if it is an impediment, this is either of <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> or of positive <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. But it is not of <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, since according to <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are equal, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Pastor. ii, 6), while it is stated at the beginning of the Digests (Manumissiones, ff. de just. et jure.) that slavery is not of <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>; and positive <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> springs from the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, as Tully says (De Invent. ii). Therefore, according to <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, slavery is not an impediment to any marriage.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, that which is an impediment to marriage is equally an impediment whether it be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> or not, as in the case of <a href="../cathen/04264a.htm">consanguinity</a>. Now the slavery of one party, if it be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the other, is no impediment to their marriage. Therefore slavery, considered in itself, is unable to void a marriage; and consequently it should not be reckoned by itself as a distinct impediment to marriage.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, just as one may be in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> about slavery, so as to deem a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> free who is a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a>, so may one be in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> about freedom, so as to deem a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> whereas he is free. But freedom is not accounted an impediment to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>. Therefore neither should slavery be so accounted.

<p><strong>Objection 7.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> is a greater burden to the fellowship of marriage and is a greater obstacle to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the offspring than slavery is. Yet <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> is not reckoned an impediment to marriage. Therefore neither should slavery be so reckoned.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a> says (De conjug. servorum, cap. Ad nostram) that "<a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> regarding the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> hinders a marriage from being contracted and voids that which is already contracted."

<p>Further, marriage is one of the goods that are sought for their own sake, because it is qualified by honesty; whereas slavery is one of the things to be avoided for their own sake. Therefore marriage and slavery are contrary to one another; and consequently slavery is an impediment to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In the marriage contract one party is bound to the other in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of paying the debt; wherefore if one who thus binds himself is unable to pay the debt, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of this inability, on the side of the party to whom he binds himself, voids the contract. Now just as impotence in respect of coition makes a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> unable to pay the debt, so that he is altogether disabled, so slavery makes him unable to pay it freely. Therefore, just as <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or impotence in respect of coition is an impediment if not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> but not if <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, as we shall state further on (58), so the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of slavery is an impediment if not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, but not if it be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Slavery is contrary to marriage as regards the act to which marriage binds one party in relation to the other, because it prevents the free execution of that act; and again as regards the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the offspring who become subject to the same <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> by reason of the parent's slavery. Since, however, it is free to everyone to suffer detriment in that which is his due, if one of the parties <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the other to be a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a>, the marriage is none the less valid. Likewise since in marriage there is an equal <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> on either side to pay the debt, neither party can exact of the other a greater <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> than that under which he lies; so that if a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> marry a bondswoman, thinking her to be free, the marriage is not thereby rendered invalid. It is therefore evident that slavery is no impediment to marriage except when it is unknown to the other party, even though the latter be in a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of freedom; and so nothing prevents marriage between slaves, or even between a freeman and a bondswoman.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Nothing prevents a thing being against <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as to the first <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and yet not against <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as to its second <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>. Thus, as stated in De Coelo, ii, all corruption, defect, and old age are contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, because <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> intends being and perfection, and yet they are not contrary to the second <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, because <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, through being unable to preserve being in one thing, preserves it in another which is engendered of the other's corruption. And when <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is unable to bring a thing to a greater perfection it brings it to a lesser; thus when it cannot produce a male it produces a female which is "a misbegotten male" (De Gener. Animal. ii, 3). I say then in like manner that slavery is contrary to the first <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Yet it is not contrary to the second, because <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> has this inclination, and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> has this desire--that everyone should be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; but from the fact that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> has an inclination that he should be punished for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and thus slavery was brought in as a punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Nor is it unreasonable for a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> thing to be hindered by that which is unnatural in this way; for thus is marriage hindered by impotence of coition, which impotence is contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in the way mentioned.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> requires punishment to be inflicted for guilt, and that no one should be punished who is not guilty; but the appointing of the punishment according to the circumstances of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and guilt belongs to positive <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Hence slavery which is a definite punishment is of positive <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and arises out of <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, as the determinate from that which is indeterminate. And it arises from the determination of the same positive <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> that slavery if unknown is an impediment to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>, lest one who is not guilty be punished; for it is a punishment to the wife to have a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> for husband, and "vice versa."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Certain <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> render a marriage unlawful; and since it is not our will that makes a thing lawful or unlawful, but the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to which our will ought to be subject, it follows that the validity or invalidity of a marriage is not affected either by <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> (such as destroys voluntariness) of the impediment or by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> thereof; and such an impediment is affinity or a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, and others of the same kind. other <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a>, however, render a marriage ineffectual as to the payment of the debt; and since it is within the competency of our will to remit a debt that is due to us, it follows that such <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a>, if <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, do not invalidate a marriage, but only when <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of them destroys voluntariness. Such <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> are slavery and impotence of coition. And, because they have of themselves the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an impediment, they are reckoned as special <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> besides <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; whereas a change of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is not reckoned a special impediment besides <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, because the substitution of another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> has not the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an impediment except by reason of the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of one of the contracting parties.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Freedom does not hinder the marriage act, wherefore <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of freedom is no impediment to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">Leprosy</a> does not hinder marriage as to its first act, since lepers can pay the debt freely; although they lay a burden upon marriage as to its secondary effects; wherefore it is not an impediment to marriage as slavery is.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether a slave can marry without his master's consent?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> cannot marry without his master's consent. For no one can give a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> that which is another's without the latter's consent. Now a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> is his master's chattel. Therefore he cannot give his wife power over his body by marrying without his master's consent.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> is bound to obey his master. But his master may command him not to consent to marry. Therefore he cannot marry without his consent.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, after marriage, a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> is bound even by a precept of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> to pay the debt to his wife. But at the time that his wife asks for the debt his master may demand of him a service which he will be unable to perform if he wish to occupy himself in carnal intercourse. Therefore if a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> can marry without his master's consent, the latter would be deprived of a service due to him without any fault of his; and this ought not to be.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, a master may sell his <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> into a foreign country, where the latter's wife is unable to follow him, through either bodily weakness, or imminent danger to her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; for instance if he be sold to unbelievers, or if her master be unwilling, supposing her to be a bondswoman; and thus the marriage will be dissolved, which is unfitting. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> cannot marry without his master's consent.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the burden under which a man binds himself to the Divine service is more advantageous than that whereby a man subjects himself to his wife. But a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> cannot enter religion or receive orders without his master's consent. Much less therefore can he be <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> without his consent.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> "In <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a> . . . there is neither bond nor free" (<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse26">Galatians 3:26-28</a>). Therefore both freeman and bondsman enjoy the same liberty to marry in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>.

<p>Further, slavery is of positive <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; whereas marriage is of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>. Since then positive <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is not prejudicial to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> or the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, it would seem that a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> can marry without his master's consent.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1, ad 3), the positive <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> arises out of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, and consequently slavery, which is of positive <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, cannot be prejudicious to those things that are of <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>. Now just as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> seeks the preservation of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, so does it seek the preservation of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> by means of procreation; wherefore even as a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> is not so subject to his master as not to be at liberty to eat, sleep, and do such things as pertain to the needs of his body, and without which <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> cannot be preserved, so he is not subject to him to the extent of being unable to marry freely, even without his master's <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or consent.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> is his master's chattel in matters superadded to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things all are equal. Wherefore, in things pertaining to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> acts, a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> can by marrying give another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> power over his body without his master's consent.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> is bound to obey his master in those things which his master can command lawfully; and just as his master cannot lawfully command him not to eat or sleep, so neither can he lawfully command him to refrain from marrying. For it is the concern of the lawgiver how each one uses his own, and consequently if the master command his <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> not to marry, the <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> is not bound to obey his master.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> has <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> with his master's consent, he should omit the service commanded by his master and pay the debt to his wife; because the master, by consenting to his <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave's</a> marriage, implicitly consented to all that marriage requires. If, however, the marriage was contracted without the master's <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or consent, he is not bound to pay the debt, but in preference to obey his master, if the two things are incompatible. Nevertheless in such matters there are many particulars to be considered, as in all <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, namely the danger to which his wife's <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is exposed, and the obstacle which the payment of the debt places in the way of the service commanded, and other like considerations, all of which being duly weighed it will be possible to judge which of the two in preference the <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> is bound to obey, his master or his wife.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> In such a case it is said that the master should be compelled not to sell the <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> in such a way as to increase the weight of the marriage burden, especially since he is able to obtain anywhere a just price for his <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> By entering religion or receiving orders a man is bound to the Divine service for all time; whereas a husband is bound to pay the debt to his wife not always, but at a fitting time; hence the comparison fails. Moreover, he who enters religion or receives orders binds himself to works that are superadded to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> works, and in which his master has power over him, but not in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> works to which a man binds himself by marriage. Hence he cannot <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> without his master's consent.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether slavery can supervene to marriage?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that slavery cannot supervene to marriage, by the husband selling himself to another as slave. Because what is done by <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> and to another's detriment should not hold. But a husband who sells himself for a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a>, does so sometimes to cheat marriage, and at least to the detriment of his wife. Therefore such a sale should not hold as to the effect of slavery.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, two favorable things outweigh one that is not favorable. Now marriage and freedom are favorable things and are contrary to slavery, which in <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is not a favorable thing. Therefore such a slavery ought to be entirely annulled in marriage.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in marriage husband and wife are on a par with one another. Now the wife cannot surrender herself to be a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> without her husband's consent. Therefore neither can the husband without his wife's consent.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things that which hinders a thing being generated destroys it after it has been generated. Now bondage of the husband, if unknown to the wife, is an impediment to the act of marriage before it is performed. Therefore if it could supervene to marriage it would dissolve it; which is unreasonable.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Everyone can give another that which is his own. Now the husband is his own master since he is free. Therefore he can surrender his right to another.

<p>Further, a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> can marry without his master's consent, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Therefore a husband can in like manner subject himself to a master, without his wife's consent.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A husband is subject to his wife in those things which pertain to the act of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; in these things they are equal, and the subjection of slavery does not extend thereto. Wherefore the husband, without his wife's <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, can surrender himself to be another's <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a>. Nor does this result in a dissolution of the marriage, since no impediment supervening to marriage can dissolve it, as stated above (50, 1, ad 7).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> can indeed hurt the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who has acted <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraudulently</a>, but it cannot be prejudicial to another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>: wherefore if the husband, to cheat his wife, surrender himself to be another's <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a>, It will be to his own prejudice, through his losing the inestimable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of freedom; whereas this can nowise be prejudicial to the wife, and he is bound to pay her the debt when she asks, and to do all that marriage requires of him for he cannot be taken away from these <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> by his master's command.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In so far as slavery is opposed to marriage, marriage is prejudicial to slavery, since the <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> is bound then to pay the debt to his wife, though his master be unwilling.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although husband and wife are considered to be on a par in the marriage act and in things relating to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, to which the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of slavery does not extend, nevertheless as regards the management of the household, and other such additional matters the husband is the head of the wife and should correct her, and not "vice versa." Hence the wife cannot surrender herself to be a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> without her husband's consent.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> This argument considers corruptible things; and yet even in these there are many obstacles to generation that are not capable of destroying what is already generated. But in things which have stability it is possible to have an impediment which prevents a certain thing from beginning to be, yet does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> it to cease to be; as instanced by the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. It is the same with marriage, which is a lasting tie so long as this life lasts.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether children should follow the condition of their father?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that children should follow the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of their father. Because dominion belongs to those of higher rank. Now in generating the father ranks above the mother. Therefore, etc.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the being of a thing depends on the form more than on the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Now in generation the father gives the form, and the mother the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> (De Gener. Animal. ii, 4). Therefore the child should follow the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the father rather than of the mother.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a thing should follow that chiefly to which it is most like. Now the son is more like the father than the mother, even as the daughter is more like the mother. Therefore at least the son should follow the father in preference, and the daughter the mother.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> genealogies are not traced through the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> but through the men. Therefore the children follow the father rather than the mother.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> If a man sows on another's land, the produce belongs to the owner of the land. Now the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> womb in relation to the seed of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is like the land in relation to the sower. Therefore, etc.

<p>Further, we observe that in animals born from different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> the offspring follows the mother rather that the father, wherefore mules born of a mare and an ass are more like mares than those born of a she-ass and a horse. Therefore it should be the same with men.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> (XIX, ff. De statu hom. vii, cap. De rei vendit.) the offspring follows the womb: and this is reasonable since the offspring derives its formal complement from the father, but the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the body from the mother. Now slavery is a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the body, since a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> is to the master a kind of instrument in working; wherefore children follow the mother in freedom and bondage; whereas in matters pertaining to dignity as proceeding from a thing's form, they follow the father, for instance in honors, franchise, inheritance and so forth. The canons are in agreement with this (cap. Liberi, 32, qu. iv, in gloss.: cap. Inducens, De natis ex libero ventre) as also the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> (<a href="../bible/exo021.htm">Exodus 21</a>).

<p>In some countries, however, where the <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> does not hold, the offspring follows the inferior <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, so that if the father be a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> the children will be slaves although the mother be free; but not if the father gave himself up as a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> after his marriage and without his wife's consent; and the same applies if the case be reversed. And if both be of servile <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> and belong to different masters, the children, if several, are divided among the latter, or if one only, the one master will compensate the other in value and will take the child thus born for his slave. However it is incredible that this custom have as much reason in its favor as the decision of the time-honored deliberations of many wise men. Moreover in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things it is the rule that what is received is in the recipient according to the mode of the recipient and not according to the mode of the giver; wherefore it is reasonable that the seed received by the mother should be drawn to her <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although the father is a more noble principle than the mother, nevertheless the mother provides the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the body, and it is to this that the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of slavery attaches.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As regards things pertaining to the specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> the son is like the father rather than the mother, but in material <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> should be like the mother rather than the father, since a thing has its specific being from its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, but material <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The son is like the father in respect of the form which is his, and also the father's, complement. Hence the argument is not to the point.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> It is because the son derives <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> from his father rather than from his mother that in the genealogies of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>, and according to common custom, children are named after their father rather than from their mother. But in matters relating to slavery they follow the mother by preference.
