<h1>Question 53. Christ's Resurrection</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/4053.htm#article1"> The necessity of His Resurrection</a> <li><a href="../summa/4053.htm#article2"> The time of the Resurrection</a> <li><a href="../summa/4053.htm#article3"> Its order</a> <li><a href="../summa/4053.htm#article4"> Its cause</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether it was necessary for Christ to rise again?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it was not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to rise again. For <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iv): "<a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> is the rising again of an animate being, which was disintegrated and fallen." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not fall by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, nor was His body dissolved, as is manifest from what was stated above (Question 51, Article 3). Therefore, it does not properly belong to Him to rise again.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whoever rises again is promoted to a higher state, since to rise is to be uplifted. But after death <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body continued to be united with the Godhead, hence it could not be uplifted to any higher <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>. Therefore, it was not due to it to rise again.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, all that befell <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> humanity was ordained for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> sufficed for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, since by it we were loosed from guilt and punishment, as is clear from what was said above (49, 1,3). Consequently, it was not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to rise again from the dead.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse46">Luke 24:46</a>): "It behooved <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to suffer and to rise again from the dead."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It behooved <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to rise again, for five reasons. First of all; for the commendation of Divine Justice, to which it belongs to exalt them who <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> themselves for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake, according to <a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse52">Luke 1:52</a>: "He hath put down the mighty from their seat, and hath exalted the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>." Consequently, because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a> Himself even to the death of the Cross, from love and obedience to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it behooved Him to be uplifted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to a glorious <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>; hence it is said in His Person (<a href="../bible/psa138.htm#verse2">Psalm 138:2</a>): "Thou hast <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>," i.e. approved, "my sitting down," i.e. My humiliation and <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, "and my rising up," i.e. My glorification in the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>; as the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> expounds.

<p>Secondly, for our instruction in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, since our <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Godhead is confirmed by His rising again, because, according to <a href="../bible/2co013.htm#verse4">2 Corinthians 13:4</a>, "although He was crucified through weakness, yet He liveth by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." And therefore it is written (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse14">1 Corinthians 15:14</a>): "If <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> be not risen again, then is our preaching vain, and our [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'your'] <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is also vain": and (<a href="../bible/psa029.htm#verse10">Psalm 29:10</a>): "What profit is there in my blood?" that is, in the shedding of My blood, "while I go down," as by various degrees of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, "into corruption?" As though He were to answer: "None. 'For if I do not at once rise again but My body be corrupted, I shall preach to no one, I shall gain no one,'" as the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> expounds.

<p>Thirdly, for the raising of our hope, since through seeing <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who is our head, rise again, we hope that we likewise shall rise again. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 15:12</a>): "Now if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> be preached that He <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">rose from the dead</a>, how do some among you say, that there is no <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the dead</a>?" And (<a href="../bible/job019.htm#verse25">Job 19:25-27</a>): "I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>," that is with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, "that my Redeemer," i.e. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, "liveth," having risen from the dead; "and" therefore "in the last day I shall rise out of the earth . . . this my hope is laid up in my bosom."

<p>Fourthly, to set in order the lives of the faithful: according to <a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse4">Romans 6:4</a>: "As <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is risen from the dead by the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Father, so we also may walk in newness of life": and further on; "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> rising from the dead dieth now no more; so do you also reckon that you are dead to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but alive to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p>Fifthly, in order to complete the work of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: because, just as for this reason did He endure <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things in dying that He might deliver us from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, so was He glorified in rising again in order to advance us towards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things; according to <a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse25">Romans 4:25</a>: "He was delivered up for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">rose again</a> for our <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not fall by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, yet He fell by death, because as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a fall from righteousness, so death is a fall from life: hence the words of <a href="../bible/mic007.htm#verse8">Micah 7:8</a> can be taken as though spoken by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: "Rejoice not thou, my enemy, over me, because I am fallen: I shall rise again." Likewise, although <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was not disintegrated by returning to dust, yet the separation of His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body was a kind of disintegration.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The Godhead was united with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh after death by personal union, but not by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> union; thus the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united with the body as its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, so as to constitute <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Consequently, by the union of the body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the body was uplifted to a higher <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but not to a higher personal state.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> wrought our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, properly speaking, by removing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>; but the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> did so as the beginning and exemplar of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether it was fitting for Christ to rise again on the third day?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem unfitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should have risen again on the third day. For the members ought to be in conformity with their head. But we who are His members do not rise from death on the third day, since our rising is put off until the end of the world. Therefore, it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who is our head, should not have risen on the third day, but that His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> ought to have been deferred until the end of the world.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, Peter said (<a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse24">Acts 2:24</a>) that "it was impossible for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be held fast by <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>" and death. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> rising ought not to have been deferred until the third day, but that He ought to have risen at once on the same day; especially since the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> quoted above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>) says that "there is no profit in the shedding of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> blood, if He did not rise at once."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> The day seems to start with the rising of the sun, the presence of which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the day. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> rose before sunrise: for it is related (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse1">John 20:1</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Mary Magdalen</a> cometh early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre": but <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was already risen, for it goes on to say: "And she saw the stone taken away from the sepulchre." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not rise on the third day.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse19">Matthew 20:19</a>): "They shall deliver Him to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to be mocked, and scourged, and crucified, and the third day He shall rise again."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>) <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's Resurrection</a> was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the instruction of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> regards <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Godhead and humanity, for it is not enough to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the one without the other, as is evident from what has been said (36, 4; cf. II-II, 2, 7,8). Consequently, in order that our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of His Godhead might be confirmed it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that He should rise speedily, and that His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> should not be deferred until the end of the world. But to confirm our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> regarding the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of His humanity and death, it was needful that there should be some interval between His death and rising. For if He had risen directly after death, it might seem that His death was not genuine and consequently neither would His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. But to establish the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death, it was enough for His rising to be deferred until the third day, for within that time some signs of life always appear in one who appears to be dead whereas he is alive.

<p>Furthermore, by His rising on the third day, the perfection of the number "three" is commended, which is "the number of everything," as having "beginning, middle, and end," as is said in De Coelo i. Again in the mystical sense we are taught that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by "His one death" (i.e. of the body) which was light, by reason of His righteousness, "destroyed our two deaths" (i.e. of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body), which are as darkness on account of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; consequently, He remained in death for one day and two nights, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> observes (De Trin. iv).

<p>And thereby is also signified that a third epoch began with the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>: for the first was before the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>; the second under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>; and the third under <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Moreover the third state of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> began with the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection of Christ</a>: for, the first was under figures of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>; the second under the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; while the third will be in the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> inaugurated by rising again.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The head and members are likened in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but not in power; because the power of the head is more excellent than that of the members. Accordingly, to show forth the excellence of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> power, it was fitting that He should rise on the third day, while the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the rest</a> is put off until the end of the world.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Detention implies a certain compulsion. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not held fast by any <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of death, but was "free among the dead": and therefore He abode a while in death, not as one held fast, but of His own will, just so long as He deemed <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the instruction of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. And a task is said to be done "at once" which is performed within a short space of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (51, 4, ad 1,2), <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> rose early when the day was beginning to dawn, to denote that by His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> He brought us to the light of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; just as He died when the day was drawing to its close, and nearing to darkness, in order to signify that by His death He would destroy the darkness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and its punishment. Nevertheless He is said to have risen on the third day, taking day as a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> day which contains twenty-four hours. And as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iv): "The night until the dawn, when the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Lord's Resurrection</a> was proclaimed, belongs to the third day. Because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who made the light to shine forth from darkness, in order that by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> and partaking of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> rising we might hear this--'once ye were darkness, but now light in the Lord'--insinuates in a measure to us that day draws its origin from night: for, as the first days are computed from light to darkness on account of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> coming fall, so these days are reckoned from darkness to light owing to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> restoration." And so it is evident that even if He had risen at midnight, He could be said to have risen on the third day, taking it as a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> day. But now that He rose early, it can be affirmed that He rose on the third day, even taking the artificial day which is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the sun's presence, because the sun had already begun to brighten the sky. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/mar016.htm#verse2">Mark 16:2</a>) that "the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> come to the sepulchre, the sun being now risen"; which is not contrary to John's statement "when it was yet dark," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Cons. Evang. iii), "because, as the day advances the more the light rises, the more are the remaining shadows dispelled." But when Mark says "'the sun being now risen,' it is not to be taken as if the sun were already apparent over the horizon, but as coming presently into those parts."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether Christ was the first to rise from the dead?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not the first to rise from the dead, because we read in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> of some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> raised to life by Elias and Eliseus, according to <a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse35">Hebrews 11:35</a>: "Women received their dead raised to life again": also <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> before His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> raised three dead <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to life. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not the first to rise from the dead.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, among the other <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which happened during the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, it is narrated (<a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse52">Matthew 27:52</a>) that "the monuments were opened, and many bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who had slept rose again." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not the first to rise from the dead.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">His own rising</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">our resurrection</a>, so by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> He is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse16">John 1:16</a>: "Of His fulness we all have received." But in point of time some others had <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> previous to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>--for instance all the fathers of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. Therefore some others came to the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the body</a> before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse20">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is risen from the dead, the first fruits of them that sleep--because," says the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a>, "He rose first in point of time and dignity."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">Resurrection</a> is a restoring from death to life. Now a man is snatched from death in two ways: first of all, from actual death, so that he begins in any way to live anew after being actually dead: in another way, so that he is not only rescued from death, but from the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, nay more, from the possibility of dying again. Such is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and perfect <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, because so long as a man lives, subject to the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of dying, death has dominion over him in a measure, according to <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse10">Romans 8:10</a>: "The body indeed is dead because of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." Furthermore, what has the possibility of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, is said to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in some respect, that is, in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. Thus it is evident that the resurrection, whereby one is rescued from actual death only, is but an imperfect one.

<p>Consequently, speaking of perfect <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the first of them who rise, because by rising He was the first to attain life utterly <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse9">Romans 6:9</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> rising from the dead dieth now no more." But by an imperfect resurrection, some others have risen before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, so as to be a kind of figure of <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">His Resurrection</a>.

<p>And thus the answer to the first objection is clear: because both those raised from the dead in the old Testament, and those raised by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, so returned to life that they had to die again.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> There are two opinions regarding them who rose with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Some hold that they rose to life so as to die no more, because it would be a greater torment for them to die a second time than not to rise at all. According to this view, as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> observes on <a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse52">Matthew 27:52-53</a>, we must understand that "they had not risen before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> rose." Hence the Evangelist says that "coming out of the tombs after <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">His Resurrection</a>, they came into the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> city, and appeared to many." But <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Ep. ad Evod. clxiv) while giving this opinion, says: "I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it appears some, that by the death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the Lord the same <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> was bestowed upon the righteous as is promised to us in the end; and if they slept not again by laying aside their bodies, it remains to be seen how <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> can be understood to be 'the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of the dead,' if so many preceded Him unto that <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>. Now if reply be made that this is said by anticipation, so that the monuments be understood to have been opened by the earthquake while <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was still hanging on the cross, but that the bodies of the just did not rise then but after He had risen, the difficulty still arises--how is it that Peter asserts that it was predicted not of David but of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that His body would not see corruption, since David's tomb was in their midst; and thus he did not convince them, if David's body was no longer there; for even if he had risen soon after his death, and his flesh had not seen corruption, his tomb might nevertheless remain. Now it seems hard that David from whose seed <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is descended, was not in that rising of the just, if an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> rising was conferred upon them. Also that saying in the Epistle to the Hebrews (11:40) regarding the ancient just would be hard to explain, 'that they should not be perfected without us,' if they were already established in that incorruption of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> which is promised at the end when we shall be made perfect": so that <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> would seem to think that they rose to die again. In this sense <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> also in commenting on Matthew (27:52,53) says: "As <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a> rose, so also many of the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> rose, that they might bear witness to the risen Christ." Nevertheless in a sermon for the <a href="../cathen/02006b.htm">Assumption</a> [Ep. ix ad Paul. et Eustoch.; among the supposititious works ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>] he seems to leave the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> doubtful. But <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine's</a> reasons seem to be much more cogent.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As everything preceding <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> coming was preparatory for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, so is <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> a disposition for <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Consequently, it behooved all things appertaining to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, whether they regard the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as the perfect fruition of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or whether they regard the body, as the glorious <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, to be first in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as the author of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: but that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> should be first in those that were ordained unto <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether Christ was the cause of His own Resurrection?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of His own <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>. For whoever is raised up by another is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of his own rising. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was raised up by another, according to <a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse24">Acts 2:24</a>: "Whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath raised up, having loosed the sorrows of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>": and <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse11">Romans 8:11</a>: "He that raised up <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> from the dead, shall quicken also your mortal bodies." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of His own <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no one is said to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, or ask from another, that of which he is himself the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. civ in Joan.): "The lowliness of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> is the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>." Moreover He asked the Father that He might be raised up again, according to <a href="../bible/psa040.htm#verse11">Psalm 40:11</a>: "But thou, O Lord, have mercy on me, and raise me up again." Therefore He was not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of His rising again.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> proves (De Fide Orth. iv), it is not the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that rises again, but the body, which is stricken by death. But the body could not unite the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with itself, since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is nobler. Therefore what rose in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> could not be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> says (<a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse18">John 10:18</a>): "No one taketh My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from Me, but I lay it down, and I take it up again." But to rise is nothing else than to take the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> up again. Consequently, it appears that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> rose again of His own power.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (50, 2,3) in consequence of death <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Godhead was not separated from His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, nor from His flesh. Consequently, both the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the flesh of the dead <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> can be considered in two respects: first, in respect of His Godhead; secondly, in respect of His <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore, according to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the Godhead united to it, the body took back again the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which it had laid aside, and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> took back again the body which it had abandoned: and thus <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> rose by His own power. And this is precisely what is written (<a href="../bible/2co013.htm#verse4">2 Corinthians 13:4</a>): "For although He was crucified through" our "weakness, yet He liveth by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." But if we consider the body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the dead <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> according to the power of <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, they could not thus be reunited, but it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be raised up by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The Divine power is the same thing as the operation of the Father and the Son; accordingly these two things are mutually consequent, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was raised up by the Divine power of the Father, and by His own power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> besought and <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and not as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> According to its <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is not more powerful than His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; yet according to its Divine power it is more powerful. Again the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by reason of the Godhead united to it is more powerful than the body in respect of its <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Consequently, it was by the Divine power that the body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> mutually resumed each other, but not by the power of their <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.
