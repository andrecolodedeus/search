<h1>Question 53. How habits are corrupted or diminished</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2053.htm#article1"> Can a habit be corrupted?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2053.htm#article2"> Can it be diminished?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2053.htm#article3"> How are habits corrupted or diminished?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether a habit can be corrupted?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> cannot be corrupted. For <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is within its subject like a second <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; wherefore it is pleasant to act from <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. Now so long as a thing is, its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not corrupted. Therefore neither can a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> be corrupted so long as its subject remains.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whenever a form is corrupted, this is due either to corruption of its subject, or to its contrary: thus sickness ceases through corruption of the animal, or through the advent of health. Now science, which is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, cannot be lost through corruption of its subject: since "the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>," which is its subject, "is a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> that is incorruptible" (De Anima i, text. 65). In like manner, neither can it be lost through the action of its contrary: since intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are not contrary to one another (Metaph. vii, text. 52). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of science can nowise be lost.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, all corruption results from some movement. But the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of science, which is in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, cannot be corrupted by a direct movement of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself, since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not moved directly. It is, however, moved indirectly through the movement of the body: and yet no bodily change seems capable of corrupting the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> residing in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>: since the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> independently of the body is the proper abode of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; for which reason it is held that <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are not lost either through old age or through death. Therefore science cannot be corrupted. For the same reason neither can <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> be corrupted, since they also are in the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> declares (Ethic. i, 10), "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is more lasting than learning."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Long. et Brev. Vitae ii) that "forgetfulness and deception are the corruption of science." Moreover, by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> a man loses a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: and again, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are engendered and corrupted by contrary acts (Ethic. ii, 2).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A form is said to be corrupted directly by its contrary; indirectly, through its subject being corrupted. When therefore a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> has a corruptible subject, and a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that has a contrary, it can be corrupted both ways. This is clearly the case with bodily <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>--for instance, health and sickness. But those <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> that have an incorruptible subject, cannot be corrupted indirectly. There are, however, some <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> which, while residing chiefly in an incorruptible subject, reside nevertheless secondarily in a corruptible subject; such is the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of science which is chiefly indeed in the "possible" <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, but secondarily in the sensitive powers of apprehension, as stated above (50, 3, ad 3). Consequently the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of science cannot be corrupted indirectly, on the part of the "possible" <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, but only on the part of the lower sensitive powers.

<p>We must therefore inquire whether <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of this kind can be corrupted directly. If then there be a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> having a contrary, either on the part of itself or on the part of its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, it can be corrupted directly: but if it has no contrary, it cannot be corrupted directly. Now it is evident that an intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> residing in the "possible" <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, has no contrary; nor can the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of that <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, have a contrary. Wherefore if in the "possible" <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> there be a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> immediately by the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, such a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is incorruptible both directly and indirectly. Such are the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of the first principles, both speculative and practical, which cannot be corrupted by any forgetfulness or deception whatever: even as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says about <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> (Ethic. vi, 5) that "it cannot be lost by being forgotten." There is, however, in the "possible" <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the reason, to wit, the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of conclusions, which is called science, to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of which something may be contrary in two ways. First, on the part of those very propositions which are the starting point of the reason: for the assertion "Good is not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" is contrary to the assertion "Good is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" (Peri Herm. ii). Secondly, on the part of the process of reasoning; forasmuch as a sophistical syllogism is contrary to a dialectic or demonstrative syllogism. Wherefore it is clear that a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> reason can corrupt the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> opinion or even of science. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a>, as stated above, says that "deception is the corruption of science." As to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, some of them are <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, residing in reason itself, as stated in Ethic. vi, 1: and to these applies what we have said of science and opinion. Some, however, viz. the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, are in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and the same may be said of the contrary <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> part are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> therein because it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to it to be moved by the reason. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> either of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> or of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, may be corrupted by a judgment of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, whenever its motion is contrary to such <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> or <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, whether through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, passion or deliberate choice.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated in Ethic. vii, 10, a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is like a second <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and yet it falls short of it. And so it is that while the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a thing cannot in any way be taken away from a thing, a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is removed, though with difficulty.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although there is no contrary to intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, yet there can be a contrary to assertions and to the process of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Science is not taken away by movement of the body, if we consider the root itself of the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, but only as it may <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> an obstacle to the act of science; in so far as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, in its act, has need of the sensitive powers, which are impeded by corporal transmutation. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> movement of the reason can corrupt the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of science, even as regards the very root of the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. In like manner a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> can be corrupted. Nevertheless when it is said that "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is more lasting than learning," this must be understood in respect, not of the subject or <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but of the act: because the use of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> continues through the whole of life, whereas the use of learning does not.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether a habit can diminish?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> cannot diminish. Because a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is a simple <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> and form. Now a simple thing is possessed either wholly or not at all. Therefore although a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> can be lost it cannot diminish.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if a thing is befitting an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, this is by reason either of the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> or of its subject. Now a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> does not become more or less intense by reason of itself; else it would follow that a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> might be predicated of its <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> more or less. And if it can become less intense as to its participation by its subject, it would follow that something is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, proper thereto and not common to the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> and its subject. Now whenever a form has something proper to it besides its subject, that form can be separate, as stated in De Anima i, text. 13. Hence it follows that a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is a separable form; which is impossible.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the very notion and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> as of any <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, is inherence in a subject: wherefore any <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> is defined with reference to its subject. Therefore if a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> does not become more or less intense in itself, neither can it in its inherence in its subject: and consequently it will be nowise less intense.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> for contraries to be applicable to the same thing. Now increase and decrease are contraries. Since therefore a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> can increase, it seems that it can also diminish.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Habits diminish, just as they increase, in two ways, as we have already explained (52, 1). And since they increase through the same <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> as that which engenders them, so too they diminish by the same <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> as that which corrupts them: since the diminishing of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is the road which leads to its corruption, even as, on the other hand, the engendering of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is a foundation of its increase.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, considered in itself, is a simple form. It is not thus that it is subject to decrease; but according to the different ways in which its subject participates in it. This is due to the fact that the subject's <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> is indeterminate, through its being able to participate a form in various ways, or to extend to a greater or a smaller number of things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument would hold, if the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> itself of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> were nowise subject to decrease. This we do not say; but that a certain decrease in the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> has its origin, not in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, but in its subject.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> No <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> how we take an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, its very notion implies dependence on a subject, but in different ways. For if we take an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01074a.htm">abstract</a>, it implies relation to a subject, which relation begins in the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> and terminates in the subject: for "whiteness is that whereby a thing is white." Accordingly in defining an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01074a.htm">abstract</a>, we do not put the subject as though it were the first part of the definition, viz. the genus; but we give it the second place, which is that of the difference; thus we say that "simitas" is "a curvature of the nose." But if we take <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> in the concrete, the relation begins in the subject and terminates in the concrete, the relation begins in the subject and terminates at the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>: for "a white thing" is "something that has whiteness." Accordingly in defining this kind of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, we place the subject as the genus, which is the first part of a definition; for we say that a "simum" is a "snub-nose." Accordingly whatever is befitting an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> on the part of the subject, but is not of the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, is ascribed to that <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, not in the <a href="../cathen/01074a.htm">abstract</a>, but in the concrete. Such are increase and decrease in certain <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>: wherefore to be more or less white is not ascribed to whiteness but to a white thing. The same applies to <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> and other <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>; save that certain <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> and other <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>; save that certain <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> increase or diminish by a kind of addition, as we have already clearly explained (52, 2).

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether a habit is corrupted or diminished through mere cessation from act?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is not corrupted or diminished through mere cessation from act. For <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are more lasting than passion-like <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>, as we have explained above (49, 2, ad 3; 50, 1). But passion-like <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> are neither corrupted nor diminished by cessation from act: for whiteness is not lessened through not affecting the sight, nor heat through ceasing to make something hot. Therefore neither are <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> diminished or corrupted through cessation from act.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, corruption and diminution are changes. Now nothing is changed without a moving <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Since therefore cessation from act does not imply a moving <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, it does not appear how a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> can be diminished or corrupted through cessation from act.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of science and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is above time. Now those things that are above time are neither destroyed nor diminished by length of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Neither, therefore, are such <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> destroyed or diminished through length of time, if one fails for long to exercise them.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Long. et Brev. Vitae ii) that not only "deception," but also "forgetfulness, is the corruption of science." Moreover he says (Ethic. viii, 5) that "want of intercourse has dissolved many a friendship." In like manner other <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are diminished or destroyed through cessation from act.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated in Phys. vii, text. 27, a thing is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of movement in two ways. First, directly; and such a thing <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> movement by reason of its proper form; thus fire <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> heat. Secondly, indirectly; for instance, that which removes an obstacle. It is in this latter way that the destruction or diminution of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> results through cessation from act, in so far, to wit, as we cease from exercising an act which overcame the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> that destroyed or weakened that <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. For it has been stated (1) that <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are destroyed or diminished directly through some contrary agency. Consequently all <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> that are gradually undermined by contrary agencies which need to be counteracted by acts proceeding from those <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, are diminished or even destroyed altogether by long cessation from act, as is clearly seen in the case both of science and of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For it is evident that a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> makes a man ready to choose the mean in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> and <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. And when a man fails to make use of his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> in order to moderate his own <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> result is that many <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> fail to observe the mode of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, by reason of the inclination of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> and of other external agencies. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is destroyed or lessened through cessation from act. The same applies to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, which render <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ready to judge aright of those things that are pictured by his <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>. Hence when <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ceases to make use of his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, strange fancies, sometimes in opposition to them, arise in his <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>; so that unless those fancies be, as it were, cut off or kept back by frequent use of his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> becomes less fit to judge aright, and sometimes is even wholly disposed to the contrary, and thus the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is diminished or even wholly destroyed by cessation from act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Even heat would be destroyed through ceasing to give heat, if, for this same reason, cold which is destructive of heat were to increase.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Cessation from act is a moving <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, conducive of corruption or diminution, by removing the obstacles, thereto, as explained above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, considered in itself, is above time, but the sensitive part is subject to time, and therefore in course of time it undergoes change as to the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the sensitive part, and also as to the powers of apprehension. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Phys. iv. text. 117) that time makes us forget.
