<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether imprudence is a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that imprudence is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [De Vera Relig. xiv]; whereas imprudence is not <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, since no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> wishes to be imprudent. Therefore imprudence is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, none but <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> comes to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with his birth. But imprudence comes to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with his birth, wherefore the young are imprudent; and yet it is not <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> which is opposed to original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Therefore imprudence is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is taken away by repentance. But imprudence is not taken away by repentance. Therefore imprudence is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> treasure of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not taken away save by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But it is taken away by imprudence, according to <a href="../bible/pro021.htm#verse20">Proverbs 21:20</a>, "There is a treasure to be desired, and oil in the dwelling of the just, and the imprudent [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'foolish'] <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall spend it." Therefore imprudence is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Imprudence may be taken in two ways, first, as a privation, secondly, as a contrary. Properly speaking it is not taken as a negation, so as merely to signify the absence of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, for this can be without any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Taken as a privation, imprudence denotes lack of that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> which a man can and ought to have, and in this sense imprudence is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by reason of a man's negligence in striving to have <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p>Imprudence is taken as a contrary, in so far as the movement or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> is in opposition to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>: for instance, whereas the right reason of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> acts by taking counsel, the imprudent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> despises counsel, and the same applies to the other <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> which require consideration in the act of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. On this way imprudence is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in respect of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> considered under its proper aspect, since it is not possible for a man to act against <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, except by infringing the rules on which the right reason of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> depends. Wherefore, if this should happen through aversion from the Divine Law, it will be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as when a man acts precipitately through contempt and rejection of the Divine teaching: whereas if he act beside the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> and without contempt, and without detriment to things <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, it will be a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> desires the deformity of imprudence, but the rash <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> wills the act of imprudence, because he wishes to act precipitately. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vi, 5) that "he who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> willingly against <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is less to be commended."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument takes imprudence in the negative sense. It must be observed however that lack of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> or of any other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is included in the lack of original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> which perfected the entire <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Accordingly all such lack of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> may be ascribed to <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Repentance restores infused <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and thus the lack of this <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> ceases; but acquired <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is not restored as to the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, although the contrary act is taken away, wherein properly speaking the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of imprudence consists.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether imprudence is a special sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that imprudence is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For whoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, acts against right reason, i.e. against <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. But imprudence consists in acting against <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore imprudence is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is more akin to moral action than <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is.

<p>But <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> which is opposed to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, is reckoned one of the general <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Much more therefore should imprudence be reckoned among those <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> consists in the corruption of the circumstances of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, wherefore <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that "<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> results from each single defect." Now many things are requisite for <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>; for instance, reason, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> docility, and so on, as stated above (Q48;49). Therefore there are many <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of imprudence, so that it is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Imprudence is opposed to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Now <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore imprudence too is one special <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> or <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may be styled general in two ways; first, absolutely, because, to wit, it is general in respect of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; secondly, because it is general in respect of certain <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, which are its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. On the first way, a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> may be said to be general on two counts: first, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, because it is predicated of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: and in this way imprudence is not a general <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as neither is <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> a general <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: since it is concerned with special acts, namely the very acts of reason: secondly, by participation; and in this way imprudence is a general <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: for, just as all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> have a share of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, in so far as it directs them, so have all <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> a share of imprudence, because no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can occur, without some defect in an act of the directing reason, which defect belongs to imprudence.

<p>If, on the other hand, a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be called general, not simply but in some particular genus, that is, as containing several <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, then imprudence is a general <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For it contains various <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in three ways. First, by opposition to the various subjective parts of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, for just as we distinguish the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> that guides the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, from other kinds that govern communities, as stated above (48; 50, 07), so also we distinguish various kinds of imprudence. Secondly, in respect of the quasi-<a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a> parts of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, which are <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> connected with it, and correspond to the several acts of reason. Thus, by defect of "counsel" to which <em>euboulia</em> (deliberating well) corresponds, "precipitation" or "temerity" is a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of imprudence; by defect of "judgment," to which <em>synesis</em> (judging well according to common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>) and <em>gnome</em> (judging well according to general <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>) refer, there is "thoughtlessness"; while "inconstancy" and "negligence" correspond to the "command" which is the proper act of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Thirdly, this may be taken by opposition to those things which are requisite for <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, which are the quasi-integral parts of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Since however all these things are intended for the direction of the aforesaid three acts of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, it follows that all the opposite defects are reducible to the four parts mentioned above. Thus incautiousness and incircumspection are included in "thoughtlessness"; lack of docility, <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, or reason is referable to "precipitation"; improvidence, lack of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> and of shrewdness, belong to "negligence" and "inconstancy."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument considers generality by participation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is further removed from <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morality</a> than <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is, according to their respective proper <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, it follows that <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, not of itself, but on account either of a preceding negligence, or of the consequent result, and for this reason it is reckoned one of the general <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. On the other hand imprudence, by its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, denotes a moral <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>; and for this reason it can be called a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> When various circumstances are corrupted for the same motive, the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not multiplied: thus it is the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to take what is not one's own, where one ought not, and when one ought not. If, however, there be various motives, there are various <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>: for instance, if one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> were to take another's property from where he ought not, so as to wrong a sacred place, this would constitute the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> called <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a>, while if another were to take another's property when he ought not, merely through the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of possession, this would be a case of simple avarice. Hence the lack of those things which are requisite for <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, does not constitute a diversity of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, except in so far as they are directed to different acts of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, as stated above.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether precipitation is a sin included in imprudence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that precipitation is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> included in imprudence. Imprudence is opposed to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>; whereas precipitation is opposed to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of counsel, according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, who says (Moral. ii, 49) that the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of "counsel is given as a remedy to precipitation." Therefore precipitation is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> contained under imprudence.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, precipitation seemingly pertains to rashness. Now rashness implies presumption, which pertains to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. Therefore precipitation is not a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> contained under imprudence.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, precipitation seems to denote inordinate haste. Now <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> happens in counselling not only through being over hasty but also through being over slow, so that the opportunity for action passes by, and through corruption of other circumstances, as stated in Ethic. vi, 9. Therefore there is no reason for reckoning precipitation as a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> contained under imprudence, rather than slowness, or something else of the kind pertaining to inordinate counsel.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/pro004.htm#verse19">Proverbs 4:19</a>): "The way of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> is darksome, they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not where they fall." Now the darksome ways of ungodliness belong to imprudence. Therefore imprudence leads a man to fall or to be precipitate.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Precipitation is ascribed metaphorically to acts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, by way of similitude to bodily movement. Now a thing is said to be precipitated as regards bodily movement, when it is brought down from above by the impulse either of its own movement or of another's, and not in orderly fashion by degrees. Now the summit of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the reason, and the base is reached in the action performed by the body; while the steps that intervene by which one ought to descend in orderly fashion are "<a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>" of the past, "<a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>" of the present, "shrewdness" in considering the future outcome, "reasoning" which compares one thing with another, "docility" in accepting the opinions of others. He that takes counsel descends by these steps in due order, whereas if a man is rushed into action by the impulse of his will or of a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, without taking these steps, it will be a case of precipitation. Since then inordinate counsel pertains to imprudence, it is evident that the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of precipitation is contained under imprudence.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Rectitude of counsel belongs to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of counsel and to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>; albeit in different ways, as stated above (Question 52, Article 2), and consequently precipitation is opposed to both.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Things are said to be done rashly when they are not directed by reason: and this may happen in two ways; first through the impulse of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> or of a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, secondly through contempt of the directing rule; and this is what is meant by rashness properly speaking, wherefore it appears to proceed from that root of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, which refuses to submit to another's ruling. But precipitation refers to both, so that rashness is contained under precipitation, although precipitation refers rather to the first.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Many things have to be considered in the research of reason; hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> declares (Ethic. vi, 9) that "one should be slow in taking counsel." Hence precipitation is more directly opposed to rectitude of counsel than over slowness is, for the latter bears a certain likeness to right counsel.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether thoughtlessness is a special sin included in prudence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that thoughtlessness is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> included in imprudence. For the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> does not incite us to any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa018.htm#verse8">Psalm 18:8</a>, "The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the Lord is unspotted"; and yet it incites us to be thoughtless, according to <a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse19">Matthew 10:19</a>, "Take no thought how or what to speak." Therefore thoughtlessness is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whoever takes counsel must needs give thought to many things. Now precipitation is due to a defect of counsel and therefore to a defect of thought. Therefore precipitation is contained under thoughtlessness: and consequently thoughtlessness is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> consists in acts of the practical reason, viz. "counsel," "judgment" about what has been counselled, and "command" [Cf. 47, 8]. Now thought precedes all these acts, since it belongs also to the speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore thoughtlessness is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> contained under imprudence.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/pro004.htm#verse25">Proverbs 4:25</a>): "Let thy eyes look straight on, and let thine eye-lids go before thy steps." Now this pertains to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, while the contrary pertains to thoughtlessness. Therefore thoughtlessness is a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> contained under imprudence.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Thought signifies the act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in considering the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> about. something. Now just as research belongs to the reason, so judgment belongs to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Wherefore in speculative matters a demonstrative science is said to exercise judgment, in so far as it judges the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the results of research by tracing those results back to the first indemonstrable principles. Hence thought pertains chiefly to judgment; and consequently the lack of right judgment belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of thoughtlessness, in so far, to wit, as one fails to judge rightly through contempt or neglect of those things on which a right judgment depends. It is therefore evident that thoughtlessness is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> did not forbid us to take thought, when we have the opportunity, about what we ought to do or say, but, in the words quoted, He encourages His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, so that when they had no opportunity of taking thought, either through lack of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or through a sudden call, they should trust in the guidance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, because "as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what to do, we can only turn our eyes to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," according to <a href="../bible/2ch020.htm#verse12">2 Chronicles 20:12</a>: else if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, instead of doing what he can, were to be content with awaiting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> assistance, he would seem to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> All thought about those things of which counsel takes cognizance, is directed to the formation of a right judgment, wherefore this thought is perfected in judgment. Consequently thoughtlessness is above all opposed to the rectitude of judgment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Thoughtlessness is to be taken here in relation to a determinate <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, namely, that of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> action, wherein more things have to be thought about for the purpose of right judgment, than in speculative matters, because actions are about singulars.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether inconstancy is a vice contained under prudence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that inconstancy is not a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> contained under imprudence. For inconstancy consists seemingly in a lack of perseverance in matters of difficulty. But perseverance in difficult matters belongs to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. Therefore inconstancy is opposed to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> rather than to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/jam003.htm#verse16">James 3:16</a>): "Where jealousy [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: '<a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>'] and contention are, there are inconstancy and every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> work."

<p>But jealousy pertains to <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>. Therefore inconstancy pertains not to imprudence but to <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a man would seem to be inconstant who fails to persevere in what he has proposed to do. Now this is a mark of "incontinency" in pleasurable matters, and of "effeminacy" or "squeamishness" in unpleasant matters, according to Ethic. vii, 1. Therefore inconstancy does not pertain to imprudence.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It belongs to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> to prefer the greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the lesser. Therefore to forsake the greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> belongs to imprudence. Now this is inconstancy. Therefore inconstancy belongs to imprudence.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Inconstancy denotes withdrawal from a definite <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> purpose. Now the origin of this withdrawal is in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, for a man does not withdraw from a previous <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> purpose, except on account of something being inordinately pleasing to him: nor is this withdrawal completed except through a defect of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, which is deceived in rejecting what before it had rightly accepted. And since it can resist the impulse of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, if it fail to do this, it is due to its own weakness in not standing to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> purpose it has conceived; hence inconstancy, as to its completion, is due to a defect in the reason. Now just as all rectitude of the practical reason belongs in some degree to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, so all lack of that rectitude belongs to imprudence. Consequently inconstancy, as to its completion, belongs to imprudence. And just as precipitation is due to a defect in the act of counsel, and thoughtlessness to a defect in the act of judgment, so inconstancy arises from a defect in the act of command. For a man is stated to be inconstant because his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> fails in commanding what has been counselled and judged.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is shared by all the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and accordingly perseverance in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> belongs to all moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, chiefly, however, to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, which suffers a greater impulse to the contrary.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Envy and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, which are the source of contention, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> inconstancy on the part of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, to which power the origin of inconstancy is due, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Continency and perseverance seem to be not in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, but in the reason. For the continent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> suffers <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a>, and the persevering <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> suffers grievous sorrows (which points to a defect in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power); but reason stands firm, in the continent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, against <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, and in the persevering <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, against sorrow. Hence <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a> and perseverance seem to be <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of constancy which pertains to reason; and to this power inconstancy pertains also.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the aforesaid vices arise from lust?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> do not arise from <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. For inconstancy arises from <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, as stated above (5, ad 2). But <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is a distinct <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> from <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse8">James 1:8</a>): "A double-minded <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is inconstant in all his ways." Now duplicity does not seem to pertain to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, but rather to deceitfulness, which is a daughter of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi, 45). Therefore the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> do not arise from <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are connected with some defect of reason. Now <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are more akin to the reason than carnal <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. Therefore the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> arise from <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> rather than from carnal <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> declares (Moral. xxxi, 45) that the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> arise from <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. vi, 5) "pleasure above all corrupts the estimate of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>," and chiefly sexual pleasure which absorbs the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and draws it to sensible delight. Now the perfection of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and of every <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> consists in abstraction from sensible objects. Wherefore, since the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> involve a defect of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and of the practical reason, as stated above (A2,5), it follows that they arise chiefly from <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Envy and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> inconstancy by drawing away the reason to something else; whereas <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> inconstancy by destroying the judgment of reason entirely. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 6) that "the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who is incontinent through <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> listens to reason, yet not perfectly, whereas he who is incontinent through <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> does not listen to it at all."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Duplicity also is something resulting from <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, just as inconstancy is, if by duplicity we understand fluctuation of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> from one thing to another. Hence Terence says (Eunuch. act 1, sc. 1) that "love leads to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and likewise to peace and truce."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Carnal <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> destroy the judgment of reason so much the more as they lead us away from <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.
