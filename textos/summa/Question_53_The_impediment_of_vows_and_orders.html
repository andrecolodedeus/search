<h1>Question 53. The impediment of vows and orders</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5053.htm#article1"> Is a simple vow a diriment impediment to Matrimony?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5053.htm#article2"> Is a solemn vow a diriment impediment?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5053.htm#article3"> Is order an impediment to Matrimony?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5053.htm#article4"> Can a man receive a sacred order after being married?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether marriage already contracted should be annulled by the obligation of a simple vow?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a marriage already contracted ought to be annulled by the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of a simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. For the stronger tie takes precedence of the weaker. Now a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is a stronger tie than marriage, since the latter binds <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but the former binds <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> takes precedence of the marriage tie.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> commandment is no less binding than the commandment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Now the commandment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is so binding that a marriage is void if contracted in despite thereof; as instanced in the case of those who marry within the degrees of kindred forbidden by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Therefore, since it is a Divine commandment to keep a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, it would seem that if a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> marry in despite of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> his marriage should be annulled for that reason.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in marriage a man may have carnal intercourse without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Yet he who has taken a simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> can never have carnal intercourse with his wife without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore a simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> annuls marriage. The minor is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> as follows. It is clear that it is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to marry after taking a simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, since according to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> [Cf. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, De Bono Viduit, ix] "for those who <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> it is damnable not only to marry, but even to wish to marry." Now the marriage contract is not contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, except by reason of carnal intercourse: and therefore he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally the first time he has intercourse with his wife, and for the same reason every other time, because a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed in the first instance cannot be an excuse for a subsequent <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, husband and wife should be equal in marriage, especially as regards carnal intercourse. But he who has taken a simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> can never ask for the debt without a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for this is clearly against his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, since he is bound to <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. Therefore neither can he pay the debt without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Pope Clement [<a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>] says (cap. Consuluit, De his qui cler. vel vovent.) that a "simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is an impediment to the contract of marriage, but does not annul it after it is contracted."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing ceases to be in one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> power from the fact that it passes into the power of another. Now the promise of a thing does not transfer it into the power of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to whom it is promised, wherefore a thing does not cease to be in a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> power for the reason that he has promised it. Since then a simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> contains merely a simple promise of one's body to the effect of keeping <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake, a man still retains power over his own body after a simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, and consequently can surrender it to another, namely his wife; and in this surrender consists the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>, which is indissoluble. Therefore although a simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is an impediment to the contracting of a marriage, since it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to marry after taking a simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, yet since the contract is valid, the marriage cannot be annulled on that account.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is a stronger tie than <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>, as regards that to which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is tied, and the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> under which he lies. because by marriage a man is tied to his wife, with the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of paying the debt, whereas by a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> a man is tied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of remaining continent. But as to the manner in which he is tied marriage is a stronger tie than a simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, since by marriage a man surrenders himself actually to the power of his wife, but not by a simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> as explained above: and the possessor is always in the stronger position. In this respect a simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> binds in the same way as a <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothal</a>; wherefore a <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothal</a> must be annulled on account of a simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The contracting of a marriage between blood relations is annulled by the commandment forbidding such marriages, not precisely because it is a commandment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but because it makes it impossible for the body of a kinswoman to be transferred into the power of her kinsman: whereas the commandment forbidding marriage after a simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> has not this effect, as already stated. Hence the argument is void for it assigns as a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that which is not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If after taking a simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> a man contract marriage by words of the present, he cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> his wife without mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because until the marriage is consummated he is still in a position to fulfill the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>. But after the marriage has been consummated, thenceforth through his fault it is unlawful for him not to pay the debt when his wife asks: wherefore this is not covered by his <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, as explained above (ad 1). Nevertheless he should <a href="../cathen/02055a.htm">atone</a> for not keeping <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, by his tears of repentance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> After contracting marriage he is still bound to keep his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> in those matters wherein he is not rendered unable to do so. Hence if his wife die he is bound to <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> altogether. And since the marriage tie does not bind him to ask for the debt, he cannot ask for it without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, although he can pay the debt without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> on being asked, when once he has incurred this <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> through the carnal intercourse that has already occurred. And this holds whether the wife ask expressly or interpretively, as when she is ashamed and her husband feels that she desires him to pay the debt, for then he may pay it without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. This is especially the case if he <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> to endanger her <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>: nor does it matter that they are equal in the marriage act, since everyone may renounce what is his own. Some say, however, that he may both ask and pay lest the marriage become too burdensome to the wife who has always to ask; but if this be looked into aright, it is the same as asking interpretively.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether a solemn vow dissolves a marriage already contracted?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that not even a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> dissolves a marriage already contracted. For according to a <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a> (cap. Rursus, De his qui cler. vel vovent.) "in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sight a simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is no less binding than a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> one." Now marriage stands or falls by virtue of the Divine acceptance. Therefore since a simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> does not dissolve marriage, neither will a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> dissolve it.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> does not add the same force to a simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> as an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> does. Now a simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, even though an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> be added thereto, does not dissolve a marriage already contracted. Neither therefore does a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> has nothing that a simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> cannot have. For a simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> may give rise to <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> since it may be public, even as a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. Again the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> could and should ordain that a simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> dissolves a marriage already contracted, so that many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> may be avoided. Therefore for the same reason that a simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> does not dissolve a marriage already contracted, neither should a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> dissolve it.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> He who takes a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> contracts a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> marriage with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is much more excellent than a material marriage. Now a material marriage already contracted annuls a marriage contracted afterwards. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> does also.

<p>Further, the same conclusion may be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by many authorities quoted in the text (Sent. iv, D, 28).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> All agree that as a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is an impediment to the contracting of marriage, so it invalidates the contract. Some assign <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> as the reason. But this is futile, because even a simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> sometimes leads to <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> since it is at times somewhat public. Moreover the indissolubility of marriage belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of life [Cf. I, 16, 4, ad 3; I, 21, 2, ad 2; II-II, 109, 3, ad 3], which <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not to be set aside on account of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>. Wherefore others say that it is on account of the ordinance of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But this again is insufficient, since in that case the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> might decide the contrary, which is seemingly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>. Wherefore we must say with others that a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> dissolves the marriage contract, inasmuch namely as thereby a man has lost the power over his own body, through surrendering it to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the purpose of perpetual <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>. Wherefore he is unable to surrender it to the power of a wife by contracting marriage. And since the marriage that follows such a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is void, a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of this kind is said to annul the marriage contracted.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is said to be no less binding in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sight than a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, in matters pertaining to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for instance the separation from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because he who breaks a simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> commits a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> just as one who breaks a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, although it is more grievous to break a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, so that the comparison be understood as to the genus and not as to the definite degree of guilt. But as regards marriage, whereby one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is under an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to another, there is no need for it to be of equal <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> even in general, since a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> binds to certain things to which a simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> does not bind.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> An <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is more binding than a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> on the part of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>: but a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is more binding as to the manner in which it binds, in so far as it is an actual surrender of that which is promised; while an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> does not do this actually. Hence the conclusion does not follow.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> implies the actual surrender of one's body, whereas a simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> does not, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Hence the argument does not suffice to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the conclusion.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether order is an impediment to matrimony?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that order is not an impediment to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>. For nothing is an impediment to a thing except its contrary. But order is not contrary to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>. Therefore it is not an impediment thereto.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, orders are the same with us as with the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>. But they are not an impediment to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>. Therefore, etc.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> signifies the union of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Now this is most fittingly signified in those who are <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> ministers, those namely who are ordained. Therefore order is not an impediment to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, all the orders are directed to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things. Now order cannot be an impediment to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> except by reason of its spirituality. Therefore if order is an impediment to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>, every order will be an impediment, and this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, every ordained <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> can have <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a>, and can enjoy equally the <a href="../cathen/02476a.htm">privilege of clergy</a>. If, therefore, orders are an impediment to marriage, because <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> cannot have an <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefice</a>, nor enjoy the <a href="../cathen/02476a.htm">privilege of clergy</a>, as jurists assert (cap. Joannes et seqq., De cler. conjug.), then every order ought to be an impediment. Yet this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, as shown by the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a> of <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> (De cler. conjug., cap. Si Quis): and consequently it would seem that no order is an impediment to marriage.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a> says (De cler. conjug., cap. Si Quis): "any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> whom you shall find to have taken a wife after receiving the subdiaconate or the higher orders, you shall compel to put his wife away." But this would not be so if the marriage were valid.

<p>Further, no <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who has vowed <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> can contract marriage. Now some orders have a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> connected with them, as appears from the text (Sent. iv, D, 37). Therefore in that case order is an impediment to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> By a certain fittingness the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> order requires that it should be an impediment to marriage: because those who are in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> orders handle the sacred vessels and the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>: wherefore it is becoming that they keep their bodies clean by <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> [Cf. <a href="../bible/isa052.htm#verse11">Isaiah 52:11</a>]. But it is owing to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> ordinance that it is actually an impediment to marriage. However it is not the same with the Latins as with the Greeks; since with the Greeks it is an impediment to the contracting of marriage, solely by virtue of order; whereas with the Latins it is an impediment by virtue of order, and besides by virtue of the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> which is annexed to the sacred orders; for although this <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is not expressed in words, nevertheless a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is understood to have taken it by the very fact of his being ordained. Hence among the Greeks and other Eastern peoples a sacred order is an impediment to the contracting of <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> but it does not forbid the use of marriage already contracted: for they can use marriage contracted previously, although they cannot be <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> again. But in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a> it is an impediment both to marriage and to the use of marriage, unless perhaps the husband should receive a sacred order without the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or consent of his wife, because this cannot be prejudicial to her. Of the distinction between sacred and non-sacred orders now and in the early Church we have spoken above (Question 37, Article 3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although a sacred order is not contrary to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, it has a certain incompatibility with marriage in respect of the latter's act which is an obstacle to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> acts.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The objection is based on a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> statement: since order is everywhere an impediment to the contracting of marriage, although it has not everywhere a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> annexed to it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Those who are in sacred orders signify <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by more sublime actions, as appears from what has been said in the treatise on orders (37, 2,4), than those who are <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a>. Consequently the conclusion does not follow.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Those who are in <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>are not forbidden to marry by virtue of their order; for although those orders are entrusted with certain spiritualities, they are not admitted to the immediate handling of sacred things, as those are who are in sacred orders. But according to the laws of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a>, the use of marriage is an impediment to the exercise of a non-sacred order, for the sake of maintaining a greater honesty in the offices of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. And since the holding of an <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefice</a> binds a man to the exercise of his order, and since for this very reason he enjoys the <a href="../cathen/02476a.htm">privilege of clergy</a>, it follows that in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> this privilege is forfeit to a <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>.

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the last Objection.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether a sacred order cannot supervene to matrimony?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a sacred order cannot supervene to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>. For the stronger prejudices the weaker. Now a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> is stronger than a bodily tie. Therefore if a <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be ordained, this will prejudice the wife, so that she will be unable to demand the debt, since order is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, and marriage a bodily bond. Hence it would seem that a man cannot receive a sacred order after consummating marriage.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, after consummating the marriage, one of the parties cannot <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> without the other's consent [Cf. 61, 1]. Now a sacred order has a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> annexed to it. Therefore if the husband be ordained without his wife's consent, she will be bound to remain continent against her will, since she cannot marry another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> during her husband's lifetime.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a husband may not even for a time devote himself to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> without his wife's consent (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse5">1 Corinthians 7:5</a>). But in the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a> those who are in sacred orders are bound to <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> for the time when they exercise their office. Therefore neither may they be ordained without their wife's consent, and much less may the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, husband and wife are on a par with one another. Now a <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> cannot marry again after his wife's death. Therefore neither can his wife after her husband's death. But she cannot be deprived by her husband's act of the right to marry after his death. Therefore her husband cannot receive orders after marriage.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, order is as much opposed to marriage as marriage to order. Now a previous order is an impediment to a subsequent marriage. Therefore, etc.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">Religious</a> are bound to <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> like those who are in sacred orders. But a man may enter religion after marriage, if his wife die, or if she consent. Therefore he can also receive orders.

<p>Further, a man may become a man's bondsman after marriage. Therefore he can become a bondsman of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by receiving orders.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Marriage is not an impediment to the receiving of sacred orders, since if a <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> receive sacred orders, even though his wife be unwilling, he receives the character of order: but he lacks the exercise of his order. If, however, his wife consent, or if she be dead, he receives both the order and the exercise.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The bond of orders dissolves the bond of marriage as regards the payment of the debt, in respect of which it is incompatible with marriage, on the part of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> ordained, since he cannot demand the debt, nor is the wife bound to pay it. But it does not dissolve the bond in respect of the other party, since the husband is bound to pay the debt to the wife if he cannot persuade her to observe <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> If the husband receive sacred orders with the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and consent of his wife, she is bound to <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> perpetual <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, but she is not bound to enter religion, if she has no fear of her <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> being endangered through her husband having taken a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>: it would have been different, however, if he had taken a simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. On the other hand, if he be ordained without her consent, she is not bound in this way, because the result is not prejudicial to her in any way.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It would seem more probable, although some say the contrary, that even a Greek ought not to receive sacred orders without his wife's consent, since at least at the time of his ministry she would be deprived of the payment of the debt, of which she cannot be deprived according to <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> if the husband should have been ordained without her consent or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As stated, among the Greeks the wife, by the very fact of consenting to her husband's receiving a sacred order, binds herself never to marry another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, because the signification of marriage would not be safeguarded, and this is especially required in the marriage of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. If, however, he be ordained without her consent, seemingly she would not be under that <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Marriage has for its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> our consent: not so order, which has a sacramental <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> appointed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> may be impeded by a previous order; so as not to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> marriage: whereas order cannot be impeded by marriage, so as not to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> order, because the power of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> is unchangeable, whereas <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> can be impeded.
