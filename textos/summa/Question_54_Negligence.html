<h1>Question 54. Negligence</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3054.htm#article1"> Is negligence a special sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3054.htm#article2"> To which virtue is it opposed?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3054.htm#article3"> Is negligence a mortal sin?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether negligence is a special sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that negligence is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For negligence is opposed to diligence. But diligence is required in every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore negligence is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which is common to every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now negligence is common to every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because he who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> neglects that which withdraws him from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and he who perseveres in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> neglects to be <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a> for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore negligence is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> had a determinate <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But negligence seems to have no determinate <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: since it is neither about <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> or indifferent things (for no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is accused of negligence if he omit them), nor about <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, for if these be done negligently, they are no longer <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore it seems that negligence is not a special <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">Sins</a> committed through negligence, are distinguished from those which are committed through contempt.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Negligence denotes lack of due solicitude. Now every lack of a due act is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>: wherefore it is evident that negligence is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and that it must needs have the character of a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> according as solicitude is the act of a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For certain <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are special through being about a special <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is about sexual matters, while some <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are special on account of their having a special kind of act which extends to all kinds of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and such are all <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> affecting an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, since every <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> extends to any kind of moral <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Since then solicitude is a special <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, as stated above (Question 47, Article 09), it follows that negligence, which denotes lack of solicitude, is a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Diligence seems to be the same as solicitude, because the more we love [diligimus] a thing the more solicitous are we about it. Hence diligence, no less than solicitude, is required for every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, in so far as due acts of reason are requisite for every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> there must needs be a defect affecting an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, for instance a defect in counsel or the like. Hence just as precipitation is a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> on account of a special <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> which is omitted, namely counsel, although it may be found in any kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; so negligence is a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> on account of the lack of a special <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, namely solicitude, although it is found more or less in all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Properly speaking the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of negligence is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that one ought to do, not that it is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> when it is done negligently, but because on account of negligence it incurs a lack of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, whether a due act be entirely omitted through lack of solicitude, or some due circumstance be omitted.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether negligence is opposed to prudence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that negligence is not opposed to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. For negligence seems to be the same as idleness or laziness, which belongs to sloth, according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi, 45). Now sloth is not opposed to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, but to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as stated above (Question 35, Article 3). Therefore negligence is not opposed to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a> seems to be due to negligence. But <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of omission are not opposed to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, but to the executive moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Therefore negligence is not opposed to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, imprudence relates to some <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. But negligence does not imply a defect of counsel, for that is "precipitation," nor a defect of judgment, since that is "thoughtlessness," nor a defect of command, because that is "inconstancy." Therefore negligence does not pertain to imprudence.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/ecc007.htm#verse19">Ecclesiastes 7:19</a>): "He that feareth <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, neglecteth nothing." But every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is excluded by the opposite <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore negligence is opposed to fear rather than to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/sir020.htm#verse7">Sirach 20:7</a>): "A babbler and a fool [imprudens] will regard no time." Now this is due to negligence. Therefore negligence is opposed to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Negligence is directly opposed to solicitude. Now solicitude pertains to the reason, and rectitude of solicitude to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Hence, on the other hand, negligence pertains to imprudence. This appears from its very name, because, as <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> observes (Etym. x) "a negligent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is one who fails to choose [nec eligens]": and the right choice of the means belongs to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Therefore negligence pertains to imprudence.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Negligence is a defect in the internal act, to which choice also belongs: whereas idleness and laziness denote slowness of execution, yet so that idleness denotes slowness in setting about the execution, while laziness denotes remissness in the execution itself. Hence it is becoming that laziness should arise from sloth, which is "an oppressive sorrow," i.e. hindering, the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> from action [Cf. 35, 1; I-II, 35, 8].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Omission regards the external act, for it consists in failing to perform an act which is due. Hence it is opposed to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and is an effect of negligence, even as the execution of a just <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> is the effect of right reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Negligence regards the act of command, which solicitude also regards. Yet the negligent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> fails in regard to this act otherwise than the inconstant <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: for the inconstant <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> fails in commanding, being hindered as it were, by something, whereas the negligent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> fails through lack of a prompt will.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> helps us to avoid all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, because according to <a href="../bible/pro015.htm#verse27">Proverbs 15:27</a>, "by the fear of the Lord everyone declineth from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." Hence fear makes us avoid negligence, yet not as though negligence were directly opposed to fear, but because fear incites <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to acts of reason. Wherefore also it has been stated above (I-II, 44, 2) when we were treating of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, that "fear makes us take counsel."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether negligence can be a mortal sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that negligence cannot be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> [Moral. ix. 34 on <a href="../bible/job009.htm#verse28">Job 9:28</a>, "I feared all my works," etc.] says that "too little love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> aggravates the former," viz. negligence. But wherever there is mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is done away with altogether. Therefore negligence is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/sir007.htm#verse34">Sirach 7:34</a>, "For thy negligences purify thyself with a few," says: "Though the offering be small it cleanses the negligences of many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." Now this would not be, if negligence were a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore negligence is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, under the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> certain <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> were prescribed for mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as appears from the book of Leviticus. Yet no sacrifice was prescribed for negligence. Therefore negligence is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/pro019.htm#verse16">Proverbs 19:16</a>): "He that neglecteth his own life [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'way'] shall die."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (2, ad 3), negligence arises out of a certain remissness of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, the result being a lack of solicitude on the part of the reason in commanding what it should command, or as it should command. Accordingly negligence may happen to be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in two ways. First on the part of that which is omitted through negligence. If this be either an act or a circumstance <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, it will be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Secondly on the part of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: for if the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> be so remiss about Divine things, as to fall away altogether from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, such negligence is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and this is the case chiefly when negligence is due to contempt.

<p>But if negligence consists in the omission of an act or circumstance that is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, it is not a mortal but a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, provided the negligence arise, not from contempt, but from some lack of fervor, to which venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is an occasional obstacle.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Man may be said to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> less in two ways. First through lack of the fervor of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the negligence that is a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: secondly through lack of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> itself, in which sense we say that a man loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> less when he loves Him with a merely <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love; and this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the negligence that is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> According to the same authority (<a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a>), a small offering made with a <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> mind and out of pure love, cleanses <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> not only from venial but also from mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> When negligence consists in the omission of that which is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, it is drawn to the other more manifest genus of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Because those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that consist of inward actions, are more hidden, wherefore no special <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> were prescribed for them in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, since the offering of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> was a kind of public confession of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, whereas hidden <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> should not be confessed in public.
