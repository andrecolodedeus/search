<h1>Question 54. The distinction of habits</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2054.htm#article1"> Can many habits be in one power?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2054.htm#article2"> Are habits distinguished by their objects?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2054.htm#article3"> Are habits divided into good and bad?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2054.htm#article4"> May one habit be made up of many habits?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether many habits can be in one power?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there cannot be many <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> in one power. For when several things are distinguished in respect of the same thing, if one of them be multiplied, the others are too. Now <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> and powers are distinguished in respect of the same thing, viz. their acts and objects. Therefore they are multiplied in like manner. Therefore there cannot be many <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> in one power.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a power is a simple force. Now in one simple subject there cannot be diversity of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>; for the subject is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of its <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>; and it does not appear how diverse effects can proceed from one simple <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Therefore there cannot be many <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> in one power.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as the body is informed by its shape, so is a power informed by a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. But one body cannot be informed at the same time by various shapes. Therefore neither can a power be informed at the same time by many <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>. Therefore several <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> cannot be at the same time in one power.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is one power; wherein, nevertheless, are the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of various <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 49, Article 4), <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are dispositions of a thing that is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to something, either to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, or to operation, which is the end of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. As to those <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> which are dispositions to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it is clear that several can be in one same subject: since in one subject we may take parts in various ways, according to the various dispositions of which parts there are various <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>. Thus, if we take the humors as being parts of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, according to their disposition in respect of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, we have the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> or disposition of health: while, if we take like parts, such as nerves, bones, and flesh, the disposition of these in respect of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is strength or weakness; whereas, if we take the limbs, i.e. the hands, feet, and so on, the disposition of these in proportion to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, is beauty: and thus there are several <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> or dispositions in the same subject.

<p>If, however, we speak of those <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> that are dispositions to operation, and belong properly to the powers; thus, again, there may be several <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> in one power. The reason for this is that the subject of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is a passive power, as stated above (Question 51, Article 2): for it is only an active power that cannot be the subject of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, as was clearly shown above (Question 51, Article 2). Now a passive power is compared to the determinate act of any <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to form: because, just as <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is determinate to one form by one agent, so, too, is a passive power determined by the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of one active object to an act specifically one. Wherefore, just as several objects can move one passive power, so can one passive power be the subject of several acts or perfections specifically diverse. Now <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> or forms adhering to a power, and inclining that power to acts of a determinate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Consequently several <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, even as several specifically different acts, can belong to one power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Even as in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things, diversity of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is according to the form, and diversity of genus, according to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as stated in Metaph. v, text. 33 (since things that differ in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> belong to different genera): so, too, generic diversity of objects entails a difference of powers (wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says in Ethic. vi, 1, that "those objects that differ generically belong to different departments of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>"); while specific difference of objects entails a specific difference of acts, and consequently of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> also. Now things that differ in genus differ in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but not vice versa. Wherefore the acts and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of different powers differ in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>: but it does not follow that different <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are in different powers, for several can be in one power. And even as several genera may be included in one genus, and several <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> be contained in one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; so does it happen that there are several <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> and powers.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although a power is simple as to its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, it is multiple virtually, inasmuch as it extends to many specifically different acts. Consequently there is nothing to prevent many superficially different <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> from being in one power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A body is informed by its shape as by its own terminal boundaries: whereas a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is not the terminal boundary of a power, but the disposition of a power to an act as to its ultimate term. Consequently one same power cannot have several acts at the same time, except in so far as perchance one act is comprised in another; just as neither can a body have several shapes, save in so far as one shape enters into another, as a three-sided in a four-sided figure. For the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> cannot understand several things at the same time "actually"; and yet it can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> several things at the same time "<a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a>."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether habits are distinguished by their objects?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are not distinguished by their objects. For contraries differ in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Now the same <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of science regards contraries: thus medicine regards the healthy and the unhealthy. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are not distinguished by objects specifically distinct.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, different <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> are different <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>. But the same scientific <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> belongs to different <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>: thus both the <a href="../cathen/12047a.htm">physicist</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a> <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the earth to be round, as stated in Phys. ii, text. 17. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are not distinguished by their objects.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, wherever the act is the same, the object is the same. But the same act can belong to different <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, if it be directed to different ends; thus to give money to anyone, if it be done for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake, is an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; while, if it be done in order to pay a debt, it is an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Therefore the same object can also belong to different <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>. Therefore diversity of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> does not follow diversity of objects.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Acts differ in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> according to the diversity of their objects, as stated above (Question 18, Article 5). But <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are dispositions to acts. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> also are distinguished according to the diversity of objects.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is both a form and a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. Hence the specific distinction of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> may be taken in the ordinary way in which forms differ specifically; or according to that mode of distinction which is proper to <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>. Accordingly forms are distinguished from one another in reference to the diversity of their active principles, since every agent produces its like in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Habits, however, imply order to something: and all things that imply order to something, are distinguished according to the distinction of the things to which they are ordained. Now a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is a disposition implying a twofold order: viz. to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and to an operation consequent to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p>Accordingly <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are specifically distinct in respect of three things. First, in respect of the active principles of such dispositions; secondly, in respect of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; thirdly, in respect of specifically different objects, as will appear from what follows.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In distinguishing powers, or also <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, we must consider the object not in its material but in its formal aspect, which may differ in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> or even in genus. And though the distinction between specific contraries is a real distinction yet they are both <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> under one aspect, since one is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through the other. And consequently in so far as they concur in the one aspect of cognoscibility, they belong to one cognitive <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12047a.htm">physicist</a> proves the earth to be round by one means, the <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a> by another: for the latter proves this by means of mathematics, e.g. by the shapes of eclipses, or something of the sort; while the former proves it by means of physics, e.g. by the movement of heavy bodies towards the center, and so forth. Now the whole force of a demonstration, which is "a syllogism producing science," as stated in Poster. i, text. 5, depends on the mean. And consequently various means are as so many active principles, in respect of which the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of science are distinguished.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Phys. ii, text. 89; Ethic. vii, 8), the end is, in practical matters, what the principle is in speculative matters. Consequently diversity of ends demands a diversity of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, even as diversity of active principles does. Moreover the ends are objects of the internal acts, with which, above all, the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are concerned, as is evident from what has been said (18, 6; 19, 2, ad 1; 34, 4).

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether habits are divided into good and bad?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are not divided into <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and bad. For <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and bad are contraries. Now the same <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> regards contraries, as was stated above (2, Objection 1). Therefore <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are not divided into <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and bad.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is convertible with being; so that, since it is common to all, it cannot be accounted a specific difference, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> declares (Topic. iv). Again, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, since it is a privation and a non-being, cannot differentiate any being. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> cannot be specifically divided into <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, there can be different <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> about one same object; for instance, intemperance and insensibility about matters of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>: and in like manner there can be several <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>; for instance, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/07292c.htm">heroic or godlike virtue</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> clearly states (Ethic. vii, 1). Therefore, <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are not divided into <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and bad.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is contrary to a bad <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. Now contraries are divided specifically into <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and bad <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are specifically distinct not only in respect of their objects and active principles, but also in their relation to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now, this happens in two ways. First, by reason of their suitableness or unsuitableness to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. In this way a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is specifically distinct from a bad <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>: since a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is one which disposes to an act suitable to the agent's <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, while an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is one which disposes to an act unsuitable to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Thus, acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are suitable to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, since they are according to reason, whereas acts of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> are discordant from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, since they are against <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Hence it is clear that <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are distinguished specifically by the difference of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and bad.

<p>Secondly, <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are distinguished in relation to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, from the fact that one <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> disposes to an act that is suitable to a lower <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, while another <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> disposes to an act befitting a higher <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. And thus <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which disposes to an act befitting <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, is distinct from godlike or <a href="../cathen/07292c.htm">heroic virtue</a>, which disposes to an act befitting some higher <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The same <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> may be about contraries in so far as contraries agree in one common aspect. Never, however, does it happen that contrary <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are in one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>: since contrariety of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> follows contrariety of aspect. Accordingly <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are divided into <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and bad, namely, inasmuch as one <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and another bad; but not by reason of one <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> being something <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and another about something bad.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is not the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is common to every being, that is a difference constituting the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>; but some determinate <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by reason of suitability to some determinate, viz. the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. In like manner the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that constitutes a difference of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> is not a pure privation, but something determinate repugnant to a determinate <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Several <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> about one same specific thing are distinct in reference to their suitability to various <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, as stated above. But several bad <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> in respect of one action are distinct in reference to their diverse repugnance to that which is in keeping with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: thus, various <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> about one same <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> are contrary to one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether one habit is made up of many habits?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is made up of many <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>. For whatever is engendered, not at once, but little by little, seems to be made up of several parts. But a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is engendered, not at once, but little by little out of several acts, as stated above (Question 51, Article 3). Therefore one <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is made up of several.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a whole is made up of its parts. Now many parts are assigned to one <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>: thus Tully assigns many parts of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Therefore one <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is made up of many.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, one conclusion suffices both for an act and for a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of scientific <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. But many conclusions belong to but one science, to geometry, for instance, or to arithmetic. Therefore one <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is made up of many.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, since it is a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, is a simple form. But nothing simple is made up of many. Therefore one <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is not made up of many.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> directed to operation, such as we are chiefly concerned with at present, is a perfection of a power. Now every perfection should be in proportion with that which it perfects. Hence, just as a power, while it is one, extends to many things, in so far as they have something in common, i.e. some general objective aspect, so also a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> extends to many things, in so far as they are related to one, for instance, to some specific objective aspect, or to one <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, or to one principle, as was clearly stated above (2,3).

<p>If then we consider a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> as to the extent of its object, we shall find a certain multiplicity therein. But since this multiplicity is directed to one thing, on which the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is chiefly intent, hence it is that a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is a simple <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, not composed to several <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, even though it extend to many things. For a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> does not extend to many things save in relation to one, whence it derives its unity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> That a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is engendered little by little, is due, not to one part being engendered after another, but to the fact that the subject does not acquire all at once a firm and difficultly changeable disposition; and also to the fact that it begins by being imperfectly in the subject, and is gradually perfected. The same applies to other <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The parts which are assigned to each cardinal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, are not integral parts that combine to form a whole; but subjective or <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a> parts, as we shall explain further on (57, 6, ad 4; II-II, 48).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In any science, he who acquires, by demonstration, scientific <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of one conclusion, has the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> indeed, yet imperfectly. And when he obtains, by demonstration, the scientific <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of another conclusion, no additional <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is engendered in him: but the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> which was in him previously is perfected, forasmuch as it has increased in extent; because the conclusions and demonstrations of one science are coordinate, and one flows from another.
