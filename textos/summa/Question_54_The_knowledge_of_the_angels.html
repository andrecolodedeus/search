<h1>Question 54. The knowledge of the angels</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1054.htm#article1"> Is the angel's understanding his substance?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1054.htm#article2"> Is his being his understanding?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1054.htm#article3"> Is his substance his power of intelligence?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1054.htm#article4"> Is there in the angels an active and a passive intellect?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1054.htm#article5"> Is there in them any other power of knowledge besides the intellect?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether an angel's act of understanding is his substance?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> act of understanding is his <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is both higher and simpler than the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is its own action; as is evident from <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> (De Anima iii) and from his <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Commentator</a> [<a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Averroes</a>, A.D. 1126-1198]. Therefore much more is the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> his action--that is, his act of understanding.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. xii, text 39) that "the action of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is life." But "since in living things to live is to be," as he says (De Anima ii, text 37), it seems that life is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Therefore the action of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who understands.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if the extremes be one, then the middle does not differ from them; because extreme is farther from extreme than the middle is. But in an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and the object understood are the same, at least in so far as he understands his own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Therefore the act of understanding, which is between the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and the thing understood, is one with the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who understands.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The action of anything differs more from its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> than does its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. But no creature's <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, for this belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> only, as is evident from what was said above (Question 3, Article 4). Therefore neither the action of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, nor of any other creature, is its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is impossible for the action of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, or of any creature, to be its own <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. For an action is properly the <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a> of a power; just as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is the <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a> of a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> or of an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Now it is impossible for anything which is not a <a href="../cathen/01125b.htm">pure act</a>, but which has some admixture of <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, to be its own <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a>: because <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a> is opposed to <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is <a href="../cathen/01125b.htm">pure act</a>. Hence only in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is His <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> the same as His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> and His action.

<p>Besides, if an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> act of understanding were his <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, it would be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for it to be subsisting. Now a subsisting act of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> can be but one; just as an abstract thing that subsists. Consequently an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> would neither be distinguished from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, which is His very act of understanding subsisting in itself, nor from the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of another <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>.

<p>Also, if the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> were his own act of understanding, there could then be no degrees of understanding more or less perfectly; for this comes about through the diverse participation of the act of understanding.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> When the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is said to be its own action, such predication is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a>, but concomitant, because, since its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> consists in act, instantly, so far as lies in itself, action accompanies it: which cannot be said of the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, for this has no actions until after it has been reduced to act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The relation between "life" and "to live" is not the same as that between "<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>" and "to be"; but rather as that between "a race" and "to run," one of which signifies the act in the <a href="../cathen/01074a.htm">abstract</a>, and the other in the concrete. Hence it does not follow, if "to live" is "to be," that "life" is "<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>." Although life is sometimes put for the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. x), "<a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">Memory</a> and understanding and will are one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, one life": yet it is not taken in this sense by the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a>, when he says that "the act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is life."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The action which is transient, passing to some extrinsic object, is really a medium between the agent and the subject receiving the action. The action which remains within the agent, is not really a medium between the agent and the object, but only according to the manner of expression; for it really follows the union of the object with the agent. For the act of understanding is brought about by the union of the object understood with the one who understands it, as an effect which differs from both.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether in the angel to understand is to exist?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to understand is to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>. For in living things to live is to be, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima ii, text. 37). But to "understand is in a sense to live" (De Anima ii, text. 37). Therefore in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to understand is to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> bears the same relation to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as effect to effect. But the form whereby the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> is the same as the form by which he understands at least himself. Therefore in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to understand is to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> act of understanding is his movement, as is clear from <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. iv). But to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> is not movement. Therefore in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to be is not to understand.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The action of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, as also the action of any creature, is not his <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. For as it is said (Metaph. ix, text. 16), there is a twofold class of action; one which passes out to something beyond, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> passion in it, as burning and cutting; and another which does not pass outwards, but which remains within the agent, as to feel, to understand, to will; by such actions nothing outside is changed, but the whole action takes place within the agent. It is quite clear regarding the first kind of action that it cannot be the agent's very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>: because the agent's <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is signified as within him, while such an action denotes something as issuing from the agent into the thing done. But the second action of its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> has <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>, either simple or relative. As an example of simple <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>, we have the act "to understand," of which the object is "the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>"; and the act "to will," of which the object is "the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>"; each of which is convertible with being; and so, to understand and to will, of themselves, bear relation to all things, and each receives its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from its object. But the act of sensation is relatively <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, for it bears relation to all sensible things; as sight does to all things visible. Now the being of every creature is restricted to one in genus and <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> being alone is simply <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, comprehending all things in itself, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. v). Hence the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> alone is its own act of understanding and its own <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Life is sometimes taken for the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of the living subject: sometimes also for a vital operation, that is, for one whereby something is shown to be living. In this way the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says that to understand is, in a sense, to live: for there he distinguishes the various grades of living things according to the various functions of life.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is the reason of his entire <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, but not the reason of his whole act of understanding, since he cannot understand everything by his <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Consequently in its own specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as such an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, it is compared to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, whereas to his act of understanding it is compared as included in the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a more universal object, namely, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and being. Thus it is evident, that, although the form is the same, yet it is not the principle of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> and of understanding according to the same formality. On this account it does not follow that in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> "to be" is the same as 'to understand.'

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether an angel's power of intelligence is his essence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> the power or faculty of understanding is not different from his <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. For, "mind" and "<a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>" express the power of understanding. But in many passages of his writings, <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> styles <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> "<a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellects</a>" and "minds." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is his own power of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> power of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> be anything besides his <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, then it must needs be an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>; for that which is besides the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of anything, we call it <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>. But "a simple form cannot be a subject," as <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> states (De Trin. 1). Thus an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> would not be a simple form, which is contrary to what has been previously said (50, 2).

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Confess. xii) says, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> "nigh unto Himself," while He made primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> "nigh unto nothing"; from this it would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is of a simpler <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> than primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as being closer to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is its own power. Therefore much more is an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> his own power of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. xi) that "the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are divided into <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, power, and operation." Therefore <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, power, and operation, are all distinct in them.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Neither in an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> nor in any creature, is the power or operative faculty the same as its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>: which is made evident thus. Since every power is ordained to an act, then according to the diversity of acts must be the diversity of powers; and on this account it is said that each proper act responds to its proper power. But in every creature the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> differs from the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and is compared to it as <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> is to act, as is evident from what has been already said (44, 1). Now the act to which the operative power is compared is operation. But in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to understand is not the same as to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, nor is any operation in him, nor in any other <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> thing, the same as his <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is not his power of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>: nor is the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of any creature its power of operation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> An <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is called "<a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>" and "mind," because all his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>: whereas the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is partly <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and partly sensitive.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A simple form which is <a href="../cathen/01125b.htm">pure act</a> cannot be the subject of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, because subject is compared to <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> as <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> is to act. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is such a form: and of such is <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> speaking there. But a simple form which is not its own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, but is compared to it as <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> is to act, can be the subject of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>; and especially of such <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> as follows the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>: for such <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> belongs to the form--whereas an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> which belongs to the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, and which does not belong to the whole <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, results from the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, which is the principle of individuation. And such a simple form is an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The power of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is a <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> in regard to <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> being itself, whereas the power of operation regards <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> being. Hence there is no comparison.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether there is an active and a passive intellect in an angel?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is both an active and a passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii, text. 17) that, "in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, just as in every <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, there is something whereby it can become all things, and there is something whereby it can make all things." But an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is a kind of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore there is an active and a passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the proper function of the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is to receive; whereas to enlighten is the proper function of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as is made clear in De Anima iii, text. 2,3,18. But an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> receives enlightenment from a higher <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, and enlightens a lower one. Therefore there is in him an active and a passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The distinction of active and passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in us is in relation to the phantasms, which are compared to the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> as colors to the sight; but to the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> as colors to the light, as is clear from De Anima iii, text. 18. But this is not so in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. Therefore there is no active and passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> for admitting a passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in us is derived from the fact that we understand sometimes only in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, and not actually. Hence there must <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> some power, which, previous to the act of understanding, is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to intelligible things, but which becomes actuated in their regard when it apprehends them, and still more when it reflects upon them. This is the power which is denominated the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> for admitting an active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is due to this--that the natures of the material things which we understand do not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> outside the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as immaterial and actually intelligible, but are only intelligible in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> so long as they are outside the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Consequently it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that there should be some power capable of rendering such natures actually intelligible: and this power in us is called the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p>But each of these necessities is absent from the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. They are neither sometimes understanding only in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, with regard to such things as they <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> apprehend; nor, again, are their intelligible objects in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, but they are actually such; for they first and principally understand immaterial things, as will appear later (84, 7; 85, 1). Therefore there cannot be an active and a passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in them, except equivocally.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As the words themselves show, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> understands those two things to be in every <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in which there chances to be generation or making. <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowledge</a>, however, is not generated in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but is present <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>. Hence there is not need for admitting an active and a passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is the function of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to enlighten, not another <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, but things which are intelligible in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, in so far as by abstraction it makes them to be actually intelligible. It belongs to the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to be in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> with regard to things which are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> capable of being <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and sometimes to apprehend them actually. Hence for one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to enlighten another does not belong to the notion of an active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>: neither does it belong to the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> for the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to be enlightened with regard to <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> mysteries, to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of which he is sometimes in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. But if anyone wishes to call these by the names of active and passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, he will then be speaking equivocally; and it is not about names that we need trouble.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether there is only intellectual knowledge in the angels?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> is not exclusively <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei viii) that in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> there is "life which understands and feels." Therefore there is a sensitive faculty in them as well.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (De Summo Bono) that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have learnt many things by experience. But experience comes of many remembrances, as stated in Metaph. i, 1. Consequently they have likewise a power of <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that there is a sort of "perverted phantasy" in the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. But phantasy belongs to the imaginative faculty. Therefore the power of the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; and for the same reason it is in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, since they are of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. 29 in Ev.), that "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> senses in common with the brutes, and understands with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> there are certain powers whose operations are exercised by corporeal organs; such powers are acts of sundry parts of the body, as sight of the eye, and hearing of the ear. There are some other powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> whose operations are not performed through bodily organs, as <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will: these are not acts of any parts of the body. Now the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have no bodies <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> joined to them, as is manifest from what has been said already (51, 1). Hence of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> powers only <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will can belong to them.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Commentator</a> (Metaph. xii) says the same thing, namely, that the separated <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> are divided into <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will. And it is in keeping with the order of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> for the highest <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> creature to be entirely <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a>; and not in part, as is our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For this reason the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are called "<a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellects</a>" and "minds," as was said above (3, ad 1).

<p>A twofold answer can be returned to the contrary objections. First, it may be replied that those authorities are speaking according to the opinion of such men as contended that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> have bodies <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> united to them. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> often makes use of this opinion in his books, although he does not mean to assert it; hence he says (De Civ. Dei xxi) that "such an inquiry does not call for much labor." Secondly, it may be said that such authorities and the like are to be understood by way of similitude. Because, since sense has a sure apprehension of its proper sensible object, it is a common usage of speech, when he understands something for certain, to say that we "sense it." And hence it is that we use the word "sentence." Experience can be attributed to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> according to the likeness of the things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, although not by likeness of the faculty <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> them. We have experience when we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> single objects through the senses: the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> likewise <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> single objects, as we shall show (57, 2), yet not through the senses. But <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> can be allowed in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, according as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. x) puts it in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>; although it cannot belong to them in so far as it is a part of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. In like fashion 'a perverted phantasy' is attributed to <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, since they have a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> practical estimate of what is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; while deception in us comes properly from the phantasy, whereby we sometimes hold fast to images of things as to the things themselves, as is manifest in sleepers and lunatics.
