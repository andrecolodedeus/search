<h1>Question 54. The quality of Christ rising again</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/4054.htm#article1"> Did Christ have a true body after His Resurrection?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4054.htm#article2"> Did He rise with His complete body?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4054.htm#article3"> Was His a glorified body?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4054.htm#article4"> The scars which showed in His body</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether Christ had a true body after His Resurrection?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not have a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>. For a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body cannot be in the same place at the same time with another body. But after the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was with another at the same time in the same place: since He entered among the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> "the doors being shut," as is related in <a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse26">John 20:26</a>. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not have a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body does not vanish from the beholder's sight unless perchance it be corrupted. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body "vanished out of the sight" of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> as they gazed upon Him, as is related in <a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse31">Luke 24:31</a>. Therefore, it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not have a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body has its determinate shape. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body appeared before the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> "in another shape," as is evident from <a href="../bible/mar016.htm#verse12">Mark 16:12</a>. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not possess a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse37">Luke 24:37</a>) that when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> appeared to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> "they being troubled and frightened, supposed that they saw a spirit," as if He had not a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> but an <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> body: but to remove their <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> He presently added: "Handle and see, for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as you see Me to have." Consequently, He had not an <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> but a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iv): that is said to rise, which fell. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body fell by death; namely, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which was its formal perfection was separated from it. Hence, in order for it to be a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> resurrection, it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the same body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be once more united with the same <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And since the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the body's <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is from its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> it follows that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> was a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body, and of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as it was before. But had His been an <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> body, then His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> would not have been <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but apparent.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, not by <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> but from its glorified <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, as some say, entered in among the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> while the doors were shut, thus <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> with another body in the same place. But whether a glorified body can have this from some hidden property, so as to be with another body at the same time in the same place, will be discussed later (XP, 83, 4) when the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">common resurrection</a> will be dealt with. For the present let it suffice to say that it was not from any property within the body, but by virtue of the Godhead united to it, that this body, although a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> one, entered in among the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> while the doors were shut. Accordingly <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a sermon for <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> (ccxlvii) that some men argue in this fashion: "If it were a body; if what rose from the sepulchre were what hung upon the tree, how could it enter through closed doors?" And he answers: "If you understand how, it is no <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>: where reason fails, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> abounds." And (Tract. cxxi super Joan.) he says: "Closed doors were no obstacle to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of a Body wherein was the Godhead; for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> He could enter in by doors not open, in whose Birth His Mother's <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> remained inviolate." And <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says the same in a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> for the octave of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> (xxvi in Evang.).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above (Question 53, Article 3), <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> rose to the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> life of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. But such is the disposition of a glorified body that it is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, i.e. subject to the spirit, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse44">1 Corinthians 15:44</a>). Now in order for the body to be entirely subject to the spirit, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the body's every action to be subject to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the spirit. Again, that an object be seen is due to the action of the visible object upon the sight, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> shows (De Anima ii). Consequently, whoever has a glorified body has it in his power to be seen when he so wishes, and not to be seen when he does not wish it. Moreover <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had this not only from the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of His glorified body, but also from the power of His Godhead, by which power it may happen that even bodies not glorified are <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> unseen: as was by a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> bestowed on the blessed Bartholomew, that "if he wished he could be seen, and not be seen if he did not wish it" [Apocryphal Historia Apost. viii, 2]. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, then, is said to have vanished from the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, not as though He were corrupted or dissolved into invisible elements; but because He ceased, of His own will, to be seen by them, either while He was present or while He was departing by the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of agility.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As Severianus [Peter Chrysologus: Serm. lxxxii] says in a sermon for <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>: "Let no one suppose that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> changed His features at the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>." This is to be understood of the outline of His members; since there was nothing out of keeping or deformed in the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> which was conceived of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, that had to be righted at the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>. Nevertheless He received the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of clarity in the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>: accordingly the same writer adds: "but the semblance is changed, when, ceasing to be mortal, it becomes <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>; so that it acquired the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of countenance, without losing the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the countenance." Yet He did not come to those <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> in glorified appearance; but, as it lay in His power for His body to be seen or not, so it was within His power to present to the eyes of the beholders His form either glorified or not glorified, or partly glorified and partly not, or in any fashion whatsoever. Still it requires but a slight difference for anyone to seem to appear another shape.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether Christ's body rose glorified? [Some editions give this article as the third, following the order of the introduction to the question. But this is evident from the first sentence of the body of 3] (2] in the aforesaid editions), that the order of the Leonine edition is correct.]</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body did not rise glorified. For glorified bodies shine, according to <a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse43">Matthew 13:43</a>: "Then shall the just shine as the sun in the kingdom of their Father." But shining bodies are seen under the aspect of light, but not of color. Therefore, since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was beheld under the aspect of color, as it had been hitherto, it seems that it was not a glorified one.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a glorified body is incorruptible. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body seems not to have been incorruptible; because it was palpable, as He Himself says in <a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse39">Luke 24:39</a>: "Handle, and see." Now <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. in Evang. xxvi) that "what is handled must be corruptible, and that which is incorruptible cannot be handled." Consequently, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was not glorified.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a glorified body is not animal, but <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, as is clear from <a href="../bible/1co015.htm">1 Corinthians 15</a>. But after the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body seems to have been animal, since He ate and drank with His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, as we read in the closing chapters of Luke and John. Therefore, it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was not glorified.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse21">Philippians 3:21</a>): "He will reform the body of our lowness, made like to the body of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> was a glorified body in His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, and this is evident from three reasons. First of all, because <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">His Resurrection</a> was the exemplar and the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">ours</a>, as is stated in <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse43">1 Corinthians 15:43</a>. But in the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will have glorified bodies, as is written in the same place: "It is sown in dishonor, it shall rise in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>." Hence, since the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is mightier than the effect, and the exemplar than the exemplate; much more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, then, was the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>. Secondly, because He <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> by the lowliness of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. Hence He said (<a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse27">John 12:27</a>): "Now is My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> troubled," which refers to the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>; and later He adds: "Father, glorify Thy name," whereby He asks for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>. Thirdly, because as stated above (Question 34, Article 4), <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was glorified from the instant of His conception by perfect fruition of the Godhead. But, as stated above (14, 1, ad 2), it was owing to the Divine economy that the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> did not pass from His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to His body, in order that by the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> He might accomplish the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of our redemption. Consequently, when this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> and death was finished, straightway the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> communicated its <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the risen body in the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>; and so that body was made <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Whatever is received within a subject is received according to the subject's capacity. Therefore, since <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> flows from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> into the body, it follows that, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. ad Dioscor. cxviii), the brightness or splendor of a glorified body is after the manner of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> color in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body; just as variously colored glass derives its splendor from the sun's radiance, according to the mode of the color. But as it lies within the power of a glorified <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whether his body be seen or not, as stated above (1, ad 2), so is it in his power whether its splendor be seen or not. Accordingly it can be seen in its color without its brightness. And it was in this way that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body appeared to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> after the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> We say that a body can be handled not only because of its resistance, but also on account of its density. But from rarity and density follow weight and lightness, heat and cold, and similar contraries, which are the principles of corruption in elementary bodies. Consequently, a body that can be handled by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> touch is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> corruptible. But if there be a body that resists touch, and yet is not disposed according to the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> mentioned, which are the proper objects of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> touch, such as a heavenly body, then such body cannot be said to be handled. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body after the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> made up of elements, and had tangible <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> such as the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body requires, and therefore it could <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> be handled; and if it had nothing beyond the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, it would likewise be corruptible. But it had something else which made it incorruptible, and this was not the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a heavenly body, as some maintain, and into which we shall make fuller inquiry later (XP, 82, 1), but it was <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> flowing from a beatified <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: because, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. ad Dioscor. cxviii): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of such powerful <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, that from its fullest beatitude the fulness of health overflows into the body, that is, the vigor of incorruption." And therefore <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. in Evang. xxvi): "Christ's body is shown to be of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but of different <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, after the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiii): "After the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, our Saviour in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> but <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> flesh partook of meat with the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, not from need of food, but because it lay in His power." For as <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> says on <a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse41">Luke 24:41</a>: "The thirsty earth sucks in the water, and the sun's burning ray absorbs it; the former from need, the latter by its power." Hence after the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> He ate, "not as needing food, but in order thus to show the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of His risen body." Nor does it follow that His was an animal body that stands in need of food.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether Christ's body rose again entire?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body did not rise entire. For flesh and blood belong to the integrity of the body: whereas <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> seems not to have had both, for it is written (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse50">1 Corinthians 15:50</a>): "Flesh and blood can not possess the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> rose in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>. Therefore it seems that He did not have flesh and blood.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, blood is one of the four humors. Consequently, if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had blood, with equal reason He also had the other humors, from which corruption is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in animal bodies. It would follow, then, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was corruptible, which is unseemly. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not have flesh and blood.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> which rose, <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended to heaven</a>. But some of His blood is kept as relics in various churches. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body did not rise with the integrity of all its parts.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse39">Luke 24:39</a>) while addressing His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> after the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>: "A spirit hath not flesh and bones as you see Me to have."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body in the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> was "of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but differed in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>." Accordingly, whatever goes with the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, was entirely in the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> when He rose again. Now it is clear that flesh, bones, blood, and other such things, are of the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body. Consequently, all these things were in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body when He rose again; and this also integrally, without any diminution; otherwise it would not have been a complete resurrection, if whatever was lost by death had not been restored. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> assured His faithful ones by saying (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse30">Matthew 10:30</a>): "The very hairs of your head are all numbered": and (<a href="../bible/luk021.htm#verse18">Luke 21:18</a>): "A hair of your head shall not perish."

<p>But to say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body had neither flesh, nor bones, nor the other <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> parts of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, belongs to the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of Eutyches, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Constantinople, who maintained that "our body in that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> will be impalpable, and more subtle than wind and air: and that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>, after the hearts of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> who handled Him were confirmed, brought back to subtlety whatever could be handled in Him" [<a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a>, Moral. in <a href="../bible/job014.htm#verse56">Job 14:56</a>]. Now <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> condemns this in the same book, because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was not changed after the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse9">Romans 6:9</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> rising from the dead, dieth now no more." Accordingly, the very <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who had said these things, himself retracted them at his death. For, if it be unbecoming for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to take a body of another <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in His conception, a heavenly one for instance, as Valentine asserted, it is much more unbecoming for Him at His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> to resume a body of another <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, because in His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> He resumed unto an everlasting life, the body which in His conception He had assumed to a mortal life.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Flesh and blood are not to be taken there for the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of flesh and blood, but, either for the guilt of flesh and blood, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says [<a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a>, Moral. in <a href="../bible/job014.htm#verse56">Job 14:56</a>, or else for the corruption of flesh and blood: because, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ad Consent., De Resur. Carn.), "there will be neither corruption there, nor mortality of flesh and blood." Therefore flesh according to its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> possesses the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse39">Luke 24:39</a>: "A spirit hath not flesh and bones, as you see Me to have." But flesh, if understood as to its corruption, will not possess it; hence it is straightway added in the words of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>: "Neither shall corruption possess incorruption."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in the same book: "Perchance by reason of the blood some keener critic will press us and say; If the blood was" in the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> when He rose, "why not the rheum?" that is, the phlegm; "why not also the yellow gall?" that is, the gall proper; "and why not the black gall?" that is, the bile, "with which four humors the body is tempered, as medical science bears witness. But whatever anyone may add, let him take heed not to add corruption, lest he corrupt the health and purity of his own <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; because Divine power is equal to taking away such <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> as it wills from the visible and tractable body, while allowing others to remain, so that there be no defilement," i.e. of corruption, "though the features be there; motion without weariness, the power to eat, without need of food."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> All the blood which flowed from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, belonging as it does to the integrity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, rose again with His body: and the same reason holds good for all the particles which belong to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and integrity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But the blood preserved as relics in some churches did not flow from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> side, but is said to have flowed from some maltreated image of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether Christ's body ought to have risen with its scars?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body ought not to have risen with its scars. For it is written (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse52">1 Corinthians 15:52</a>): "The dead shall rise incorrupt." But scars and wounds imply corruption and defect. Therefore it was not fitting for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the author of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, to rise again with scars.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body rose entire, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). But open scars are opposed to bodily integrity, since they interfere with the continuity of the tissue. It does not therefore seem fitting for the open wounds to remain in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body; although the traces of the wounds might remain, which would satisfy the beholder; thus it was that Thomas <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, to whom it was said: "Because thou hast seen Me, Thomas, thou hast <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>" (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse29">John 20:29</a>).

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iv) that "some things are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> said of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> after the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, which He did not have from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> but from special dispensation, such as the scars, in order to make it sure that it was the body which had suffered that rose again." Now when the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> ceases, the effect ceases. Therefore it seems that when the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were assured of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, He bore the scars no longer. But it ill became the unchangeableness of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> that He should assume anything which was not to remain in Him for ever. Consequently, it seems that He ought not at His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> to have resumed a body with scars.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said to Thomas (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse27">John 20:27</a>): "Put in thy finger hither, and see My hands; and bring hither thy hand, and put it into My side, and be not faithless but <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It was fitting for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> at His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> to resume the body with its scars. In the first place, for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> says on <a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse40">Luke 24:40</a> that He kept His scars not from inability to heal them, "but to wear them as an everlasting trophy of His victory." Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xxii): "Perhaps in that kingdom we shall see on the bodies of the Martyrs the traces of the wounds which they bore for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> name: because it will not be a deformity, but a dignity in them; and a certain kind of beauty will shine in them, in the body, though not of the body." Secondly, to confirm the hearts of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> as to "the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>" (<a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>, on <a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse40">Luke 24:40</a>). Thirdly, "that when He pleads for us with the Father, He may always show the manner of death He endured for us" (<a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>, on <a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse40">Luke 24:40</a>). Fourthly, "that He may convince those redeemed in His blood, how mercifully they have been helped, as He exposes before them the traces of the same death" (<a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>, on <a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse40">Luke 24:40</a>). Lastly, "that in the Judgment-day He may upbraid them with their just condemnation" (<a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>, on <a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse40">Luke 24:40</a>). Hence, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Symb. ii): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> why He kept the scars in His body. For, as He showed them to Thomas who would not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> except he handled and saw them, so will He show His wounds to His enemies, so that He who is the Truth may convict them, saying: 'Behold the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whom you crucified; see the wounds you inflicted; recognize the side you pierced, since it was opened by you and for you, yet you would not enter.'"

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The scars that remained in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body belong neither to corruption nor defect, but to the greater increase of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, inasmuch as they are the trophies of His power; and a special comeliness will appear in the places scarred by the wounds.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although those openings of the wounds break the continuity of the tissue, still the greater beauty of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> compensates for all this, so that the body is not less entire, but more perfected. Thomas, however, not only saw, but handled the wounds, because as Pope Leo [Cf. Append. Opp. August., Serm. clxii] says: "It sufficed for his personal <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> for him to have seen what he saw; but it was on our behalf that he touched what he beheld."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> willed the scars of His wounds to remain on His body, not only to confirm the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, but for other reasons also. From these it seems that those scars will always remain on His body; because, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ad Consent., De Resurr. Carn.): "I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> body to be in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, such as it was when He <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended into heaven</a>." And <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xiv) says that "if aught could be changed in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, contrary to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> truthful teaching, then the Lord after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> returned to death; and what fool would dare to say this, save he that denies the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> resurrection of the flesh?" Accordingly, it is evident that the scars which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> showed on His body after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, have never since been removed from His body.
