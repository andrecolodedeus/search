<h1>Question 55. The manifestation of the Resurrection</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/4055.htm#article1"> Should Christ's Resurrection have been manifested to all men or only to some special individuals?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4055.htm#article2"> Was it fitting that they should see Him rise?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4055.htm#article3"> Should he have lived with the disciples after the Resurrection?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4055.htm#article4"> Was it fitting for Him to appeal to the disciples "in another shape"?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4055.htm#article5"> Should he have demonstrated the Resurrection by proofs?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4055.htm#article6"> The cogency of those proofs</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether Christ's Resurrection ought to have been manifested to all?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's Resurrection</a> ought to have been manifested to all. For just as a public penalty is due for public <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse20">1 Timothy 5:20</a>: "Them that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> reprove before all," so is a public reward due for public <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. But, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. civ in Joan.), "the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> is the reward of the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>." Therefore, since <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> was manifested to all while He suffered in public, it seems that the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> ought to have been manifested to all.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> is ordained for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, so also is His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse25">Romans 4:25</a>: "He rose again for our <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>." But what belongs to the public weal ought to be manifested to all. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's Resurrection</a> ought to have been manifested to all, and not to some specially.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, they to whom it was manifested were <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>: hence it is said (<a href="../bible/act003.htm#verse15">Acts 3:15</a>): "Whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath raised from the dead, of which we are <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>." Now they bore witness by preaching in public: and this is unbecoming in <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse34">1 Corinthians 14:34</a>: "Let <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> keep silence in the churches": and <a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse12">1 Timothy 2:12</a>: "I suffer not a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to teach." Therefore, it does not seem becoming for <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's Resurrection</a> to be manifested first of all to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and afterwards to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> in general.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse40">Acts 10:40</a>): "Him <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> raised up the third day, and gave Him to be made manifest, not to all the people, but to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> preordained by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some things come to our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature's</a> common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, others by special favor of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as things <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">divinely revealed</a>. Now, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. iv), the divinely established <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of such things is that they be revealed immediately by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to higher <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, through whom they are imparted to others, as is evident in the ordering of the heavenly spirits. But such things as concern future <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> are beyond the common ken of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, according to <a href="../bible/isa064.htm#verse4">Isaiah 64:4</a>: "The eye hath not seen, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, besides Thee, what things Thou hast prepared for them that wait for Thee." Consequently, such things are not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> except through Divine <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse10">1 Corinthians 2:10</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath revealed them to us by His spirit." Since, then, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> rose by a glorious <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, consequently His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> was not manifested to everyone, but to some, by whose testimony it could be brought to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> was consummated in a body that still had a passible <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all by general laws: consequently His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> could be directly manifested to all. But the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> was accomplished "through the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Father," as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse4">Romans 6:4</a>). Therefore it was manifested directly to some, but not to all.

<p>But that a public penance is imposed upon public sinners, is to be understood of the punishment of this present life. And in like manner public <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> should be rewarded in public, in order that others may be stirred to emulation. But the punishments and rewards of the future life are not publicly manifested to all, but to those specially who are preordained thereto by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's Resurrection</a> is for the common <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of all, so it came to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all; yet not so that it was directly manifested to all, but only to some, through whose testimony it could be brought to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is not to be allowed to teach publicly in church; but she may be permitted to give familiar instruction to some privately. And therefore as <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says on <a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse22">Luke 24:22</a>, "a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is sent to them who are of her household," but not to the people to bear witness to the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> appeared to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> first, for this reason, that as a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was the first to bring the source of death to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, so she might be the first to announce the dawn of <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's glorious Resurrection</a>. Hence Cyril says on <a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse17">John 20:17</a>: "Woman who formerly was the minister of death, is the first to see and proclaim the adorable <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>: thus womankind has procured <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> from ignominy, and removal of the curse." Hereby, moreover, it is shown, so far as the state of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is concerned, that the female sex shall suffer no hurt; but if <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> burn with greater <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, they shall also attain greater <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> from the Divine vision: because the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> whose love for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> was more persistent--so much so that "when even the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> withdrew" from the sepulchre "they did not depart" [<a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, Hom. xxv in Evang.]--were the first to see Him rising in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether it was fitting that the disciples should see Him rise again?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem fitting that the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> should have seen Him rise again, because it was their office to bear witness to the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, according to <a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse33">Acts 4:33</a>: "With great power did the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> give testimony to the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ our Lord</a>." But the surest witness of all is an eye-witness. Therefore it would have been fitting for them to see the very <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection of Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in order to have the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> saw <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascend into heaven</a>, according to <a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse9">Acts 1:9</a>: "While they looked on, He was raised up." But it was also <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for them to have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> ought to have risen in sight of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the raising of <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a> was a sign of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> coming <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>. But the Lord raised up <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a> in sight of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. Consequently, it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> ought to have risen in sight of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mar016.htm#verse9">Mark 16:9</a>): The Lord "rising early the first day of the week, appeared first to <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Mary Magdalen</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Mary Magdalen</a> did not see Him rise; but, while searching for Him in the sepulchre, she heard from the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>: "He is risen, He is not here." Therefore no one saw Him rise again.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse1">Romans 13:1</a>): "Those things that are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are well ordered [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Those that are, are ordained of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>]." Now the divinely established order is this, that things above men's ken are revealed to them by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. iv). But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> on rising did not return to the familiar manner of life, but to a kind of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and God-like <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse10">Romans 6:10</a>: "For in that He liveth, He liveth unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." And therefore it was fitting for <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's Resurrection</a> not to be witnessed by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> directly, but to be proclaimed to them by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Accordingly, <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> (Comment. Matth. cap. ult.) says: "An <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is therefore the first herald of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, that it might be declared out of obedience to the Father's will."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were able to testify to the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> even by sight, because from the testimony of their own eyes they saw <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> alive, whom they had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to be dead. But just as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> comes from the hearing of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a>, so did men come to the sight of the risen Christ through the message already received from <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Christ's Ascension</a> as to its term wherefrom, was not above men's common <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but only as to its term whereunto. Consequently, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were able to behold <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Christ's Ascension</a> as to the term wherefrom, that is, according as He was uplifted from the earth; but they did not behold Him as to the term whereunto, because they did not see how He was received into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. But <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's Resurrection</a> transcended common <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as to the term wherefrom, according as His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> returned from <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> and His body from the closed sepulchre; and likewise as to the term whereunto, according as He attained to the life of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Consequently, the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> ought not to be accomplished so as to be seen by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a> was raised so that he returned to the same life as before, which life is not beyond <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> common ken. Consequently, there is no parity.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether Christ ought to have lived constantly with His disciples after the Resurrection?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> ought to have lived constantly with His Disciples, because He appeared to them after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> in order to confirm their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, and to bring them comfort in their disturbed state, according to <a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse20">John 20:20</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were glad when they saw the Lord." But they would have been more assured and consoled had He constantly shown them His presence. Therefore it seems that He ought to have lived constantly with them.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, Christ rising from the dead did not at once <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascend to heaven</a>, but after forty days, as is narrated in <a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse3">Acts 1:3</a>. But meanwhile He could have been in no more suitable place than where the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were met together. Therefore it seems that He ought to have lived with them continually.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Consens. Evang. iii), we read how <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> appeared five times on the very day of His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>: first "to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> at the sepulchre; secondly to the same on the way from the sepulchre; thirdly to Peter; fourthly to the two <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> going to the town; fifthly to several of them in Jerusalem when Thomas was not present." Therefore it also seems that He ought to have appeared several times on the other days before the <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> had said to them before the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse32">Matthew 26:32</a>): "But after I shall be risen again, I will go before you into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>"; moreover an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> Himself repeated the same to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> after the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>: nevertheless He was seen by them in Jerusalem on the very day of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, as stated above (Objection 3); also on the eighth day, as we read in <a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse26">John 20:26</a>. It seems, therefore, that He did not live with the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> in a fitting way after the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse26">John 20:26</a>) that "after eight days" <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> appeared to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. Therefore He did not live constantly with them.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Concerning the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> two things had to be manifested to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, namely, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Him who rose. Now in order to manifest the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, it sufficed for Him to appear several times before them, to speak familiarly to them, to eat and drink, and let them touch Him. But in order to manifest the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the risen Christ, He was not desirous of living with them constantly as He had done before, lest it might seem that He rose unto the same life as before. Hence (<a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse44">Luke 24:44</a>) He said to them: "These are the words which I spoke to you, while I was yet with you." For He was there with them by His bodily presence, but hitherto He had been with them not merely by His bodily presence, but also in mortal semblance. Hence <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> in explaining those words of Luke, "while I was with you," says: "that is, while I was still in mortal flesh, in which you are yet: for He had then risen in the same flesh, but was not in the same state of mortality as they."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> frequent appearing served to assure the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>; but continual intercourse might have led them into the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> that He had risen to the same life as was His before. Yet by His constant presence He promised them comfort in another life, according to <a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse22">John 16:22</a>: "I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice; and your <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall take from you."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> That <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not stay continually with the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> was not because He deemed it more expedient for Him to be elsewhere: but because He judged it to be more suitable for the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles'</a> instruction that He should not abide continually with them, for the reason given above. But it is quite unknown in what places He was bodily present in the meantime, since <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> is silent, and His dominion is in every place (Cf. <a href="../bible/psa102.htm#verse22">Psalm 102:22</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> He appeared oftener on the first day, because the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were to be admonished by many <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> to accept the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> from the very out set: but after they had once accepted it, they had no further need of being instructed by so many apparitions. Accordingly one reads in the Gospel that after the first day He appeared again only five times. For, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Consens. Evang. iii), after the first five apparitions "He came again a sixth time when Thomas saw Him; a seventh time was by the sea of Tiberias at the capture of the fishes; the eighth was on the mountain of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, according to Matthew; the ninth occasion is expressed by Mark, 'at length when they were at table,' because no more were they going to eat with Him upon earth; the tenth was on the very day, when no longer upon the earth, but uplifted into the cloud, He was <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascending into heaven</a>. But, as John admits, not all things were written down. And He visited them frequently before He went up to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>," in order to comfort them. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse6">1 Corinthians 15:6-7</a>) that "He was seen by more than five hundred brethren at once . . . after that He was seen by James"; of which apparitions no mention is made in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> in explaining <a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse32">Matthew 26:32</a>--"after I shall be risen again, I will go before you into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>," says (Hom. lxxxiii in Matth.), "He goes not to some far off region in order to appear to them, but among His own people, and in those very places" in which for the most part they had lived with Him; "in order that they might thereby <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He who was crucified was the same as He who rose again." And on this account "He said that He would go into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, that they might be delivered from fear of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>."

<p>Consequently, as <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (Expos. in Luc.), "The Lord had sent word to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> that they were to see Him in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>; yet He showed Himself first to them when they were assembled together in the room out of fear. (Nor is there any breaking of a promise here, but rather a hastened fulfilling out of kindness)" [Cf. Catena Aurea in Luc. xxiv, 36]: "afterwards, however, when their <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> were comforted, they went into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>. Nor is there any reason to prevent us from supposing that there were few in the room, and many more on the mountain." For, as <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> [Of Caesarea; Cf. Migne, P. G., xxii, 1003] says, "Two Evangelists, Luke and John, write that He appeared in Jerusalem to the eleven only; but the other two said that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> and our Saviour commanded not merely the eleven, but all the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> and brethren, to go into Galilee. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> makes mention of them when he says (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse6">1 Corinthians 15:6</a>): 'Then He appeared to more then five hundred brethren at once.'" The truer solution, however, is this, that while they were in hiding in Jerusalem He appeared to them at first in order to comfort them; but in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> it was not secretly, nor once or twice, that He made Himself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to them with great power, "showing Himself to them alive after His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, by many <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>," as Luke says (<a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse3">Acts 1:3</a>). Or as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> writes (De Consens. Evang. iii): "What was said by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> and by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>--that He would 'go before them into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>,' must be taken <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a>. For if we take <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> as meaning 'a passing,' we must understand that they were going to pass from the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, who would not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> unless He prepared the way for them in men's hearts: and this is signified by the words 'He shall go before you into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>.' But if by <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> we understand '<a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>,' we are to understand this as applying to Him not in the form of a servant, but in that form wherein He is equal to the Father, and which He has promised to them that love Him. Although He has gone before us in this sense, He has not abandoned us."

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether Christ should have appeared to the disciples "in another shape"?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> ought not to have appeared to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> "in another shape." For a thing cannot appear in very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> other than it is. But there was only one shape in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore if He appeared under another, it was not a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> but a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> apparition. Now this is not at all fitting, because as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. lxxxiii, qu. 14): "If He deceives He is not the Truth; yet <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the Truth." Consequently, it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> ought not to have appeared to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> "in another shape."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, nothing can appear in another shape than the one it has, except the beholder's eyes be captivated by some illusions. But since such illusions are brought about by magical arts, they are unbecoming in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to what is written (<a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse15">2 Corinthians 6:15</a>): "What concord hath <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> with <a href="../cathen/02408a.htm">Belial</a>?" Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> ought not to have appeared in another shape.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> receives its surety from <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>, so were the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> assured of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> appearing to them. But, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in an Epistle to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> (xxviii), if but one untruth be admitted into the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Sacred Scripture</a>, the whole authority of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> is weakened. Consequently, if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> appeared to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, in but one apparition, otherwise than He was, then whatever they saw in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> after the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> will be of less import, which is not fitting. Therefore He ought not to have appeared in another shape.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mar016.htm#verse12">Mark 16:12</a>): "After that He appeared in another shape to two of them walking, as they were going into the country."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1,2), <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's Resurrection</a> was to be manifested to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in the same way as Divine things are revealed. But Divine things are revealed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in various ways, according as they are variously disposed. For, those who have minds well disposed, perceive Divine things rightly, whereas those not so disposed perceive them with a certain confusion of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> or <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>: "for, the sensual men perceiveth not those things that are of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>," as is said in <a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse14">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>. Consequently, after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> appeared in His own shape to some who were well disposed to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, while He appeared in another shape to them who seemed to be already growing tepid in their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: hence these said (<a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse21">Luke 24:21</a>): "We hoped that it was He that should have redeemed <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>." Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xxiii in Evang.), that "He showed Himself to them in body such as He was in their <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a>: for, because He was as yet a stranger to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in their hearts, He made pretense of going on farther," that is, as if He were a stranger.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Qq. Evang. ii), "not everything of which we make pretense is a falsehood; but when what we pretend has no meaning then is it a falsehood. But when our pretense has some signification, it is not a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, but a figure of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; otherwise everything said figuratively by wise and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, or even by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> Himself, would be set down as a falsehood, because it is not customary to take such expressions in the literal sense. And <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, like words, are feigned without falsehood, in order to denote something else." And so it happened here. as has been said.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Consens. Evang. iii): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> could change His flesh so that His shape really was other than they were accustomed to behold; for, before His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> He was transfigured on the mountain, so that His face shone like the sun. But it did not happen thus now." For not without reason do we "understand this hindrance in their eyes to have been of Satan's doing, lest <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> might be recognized." Hence Luke says (<a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse16">24:16</a>) that "their eyes were held, that they should not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Such an argument would <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>, if they had not been brought back from the sight of a strange shape to that of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> countenance. For, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Consens. Evang. iii): "The permission was granted by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>," namely, that their eyes should be held fast in the aforesaid way, "until the Sacrament of the bread; that when they had <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">shared in the unity of His body</a>, the enemy's hindrance may be understood to have been taken away, so that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> might be recognized." Hence he goes on to say that "'their eyes were opened, and they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him'; not that they were hitherto walking with their eyes shut; but there was something in them whereby they were not permitted to recognize what they saw. This could be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the darkness or by some kind of humor."

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether Christ should have demonstrated the truth of His Resurrection by proofs?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should not have demonstrated the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> by <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>. For <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Fide, ad Gratian. i): "Let there be no <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> where <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is required." But <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is required regarding the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> are out of place there.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xxvi): "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> has no <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> where <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> supplies the test." But it was no part of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> office to void the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Consequently, it was not for Him to confirm the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> by <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> came into the world in order that men might attain beatitude through Him, according to <a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse10">John 10:10</a>: "I am come that they may have life, and may have it more abundantly." But supplying <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> seems to be a hindrance in the way of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> beatitude; because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> Himself said (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse29">John 20:29</a>): "Blessed are they that have not seen, and have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>." Consequently, it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> ought not to manifest His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> by any <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is related in <a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse3">Acts 1:3</a>, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> appeared to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> "for forty days by many <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, speaking of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The word "<a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>" is susceptible of a twofold meaning: sometimes it is employed to designate any sort "of reason in confirmation of what is a matter of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>" [Tully, Topic. ii]: and sometimes it means a sensible sign employed to manifest the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; thus also <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> occasionally uses the term in his works [Cf. Prior. Anal. ii; Rhetor. i]. Taking "<a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>" in the first sense, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not demonstrate His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> by <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, because such argumentative <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> would have to be grounded on some principles: and if these were not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, nothing would thereby be demonstrated to them, because nothing can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> from the unknown. And if such principles were <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to them, they would not go beyond <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, and consequently would not be efficacious for establishing <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, which is beyond <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, since principles must be assumed which are of the same order, according to 1 Poster. But it was from the authority of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scriptures</a> that He <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to them the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, which authority is the basis of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, when He said: "All things must needs be fulfilled which are written in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and in the Psalms, concerning Me": as is set forth <a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse44">Luke 24:44</a>.

<p>But if the term "<a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>" be taken in the second sense, then <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is said to have demonstrated His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> by <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, inasmuch as by most evident signs He showed that He was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> risen. Hence where our version has "by many <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>," the Greek text, instead of <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> has <em>tekmerion</em>, i.e. "an evident sign affording positive <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>" [Cf. Prior. Anal. ii]. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> showed these signs of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, for two reasons. First, because their hearts were not disposed so as to accept readily the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>. Hence He says Himself (<a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse25">Luke 24:25</a>): "O foolish and slow of heart to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>": and (<a href="../bible/mar016.htm#verse14">Mark 16:14</a>): "He upbraided them with their incredulity and hardness of heart." Secondly, that their testimony might be rendered more efficacious through the signs shown them, according to <a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#verse1">1 John 1:1-3</a>: "That which we have seen, and have heard, and our hands have handled . . . we declare."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> is speaking there of <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> drawn from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, which are useless for demonstrating things of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as was shown above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> arises from this, that at <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> bidding <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> what he does not see. Accordingly, only that reason debars <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which enables one to see by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> what is proposed for <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>: and this is demonstrative argument. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not make use of any such argument for demonstrating His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated already (ad 2), the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of beatitude, which comes of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, is not entirely excluded except a man refuse to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> only such things as he can see. But for a man to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> from visible signs the things he does not see, does not entirely deprive him of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> nor of the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: just as Thomas, to whom it was said (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse29">John 20:29</a>): "'Because thou hast seen Me, Thomas, thou hast <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>,' saw one thing and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> another" [<a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, Hom. xxvi]: the wounds were what he saw, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was the object of His <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. But his is the more perfect <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> who does not require such helps for <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. Hence, to put to shame the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of some men, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse48">John 4:48</a>): "Unless you see signs and wonders, you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not." From this one can learn how they who are so ready to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even without beholding signs, are blessed in comparison with them who do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> except they see the like.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the proofs which Christ made use of manifested sufficiently the truth of His Resurrection?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> made use of did not sufficiently manifest the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>. For after the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> showed nothing to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> which <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> appearing to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> did not or could not show; because <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have frequently shown themselves to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> under <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> aspect, have spoken and lived with them, and eaten with them, just as if they were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> men, as is evident from <a href="../bible/gen018.htm">Genesis 18</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> whom <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> entertained, and in the Book of Tobias, of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who "conducted" him "and brought" him back. Nevertheless, <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> bodies <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> united to them; which is required for a resurrection. Consequently, the signs which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> showed His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were not sufficient for manifesting His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> rose again gloriously, that is, having a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> with <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. But some of the things which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> showed to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> seem contrary to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as for instance, that "He vanished out of their sight," and entered in among them "when the doors were shut": and some other things seem contrary to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, as for instance, that He ate and drank, and bore the scars of His wounds. Consequently, it seems that those <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> were neither sufficient nor fitting for establishing <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, after the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was such that it ought not to be touched by mortal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; hence He said to <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Magdalen</a> (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse17">John 20:17</a>): "Do not touch Me; for I am not yet <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended</a> to My Father." Consequently, it was not fitting for manifesting the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, that He should permit Himself to be handled by His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, clarity seems to be the principal of the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> of a glorified body: yet He gave no sign thereof in His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>. Therefore it seems that those <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> were insufficient for showing the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> [This objection is wanting in the older codices, and in the text of the Leonine edition, which, however, gives it in a note as taken from one of the more recent codices of the Vatican.]

<p>Further, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> introduced as <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> seem insufficient from the want of agreement on the part of the Evangelists. Because in Matthew's account the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is described as sitting upon the stone rolled back, while Mark states that he was seen after the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> had entered the tomb; and again, whereas these mention one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, John says that there were two sitting, and Luke says that there were two standing. Consequently, the arguments for the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> do not seem to agree.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who is the Wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, "ordereth all things sweetly" and in a fitting manner, according to <a href="../bible/wis008.htm#verse1">Wisdom 8:1</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> manifested His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> in two ways: namely, by testimony; and by <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> or sign: and each manifestation was sufficient in its own class. For in order to manifest His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> He made use of a double testimony, neither of which can be rebutted. The first of these was the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>' testimony, who announced the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, as is seen in all the Evangelists: the other was the testimony of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, which He set before them to show the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, as is narrated in the last chapter of Luke.

<p>Again, the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> were sufficient for showing that the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> was both <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>. That it was a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> He shows first on the part of the body; and this He shows in three respects; first of all, that it was a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and solid body, and not phantastic or rarefied, like the air. And He establishes this by offering His body to be handled; hence He says in the <a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse39">last chapter of Luke (39)</a>: "Handle and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as you see Me to have." Secondly, He shows that it was a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, by presenting His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> features for them to behold. Thirdly, He shows that it was identically the same body which He had before, by showing them the scars of the wounds; hence, as we read in the <a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse39">last chapter of Luke (39)</a> he said to them: "See My hands and feet, that it is I Myself."

<p>Secondly, He showed them the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> on the part of His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> reunited with His body: and He showed this by the works of the threefold life. First of all, in the operations of the nutritive life, by eating and drinking with His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, as we read in the <a href="../bible/luk024.htm">last chapter of Luke</a>. Secondly, in the works of the sensitive life, by replying to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>' questions, and by greeting them when they were in His presence, showing thereby that He both saw and heard; thirdly, in the works of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> life by their conversing with Him, and discoursing on the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. And, in order that nothing might be wanting to make the manifestation complete, He also showed that He had the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, by working the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of the draught of fishes, and further by <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascending into heaven</a> while they were beholding Him: because, according to <a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse13">John 3:13</a>: "No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hath <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended into heaven</a>, but He that descended from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> who is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>."

<p>He also showed His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> by entering in among them when the doors were closed: as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xxvi in Evang.): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> allowed them to handle His flesh which He had brought through closed doors, to show that His body was of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> but of different <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>." It likewise was part of the property of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> that "He vanished suddenly from their eyes," as related in the last chapter of Luke; because thereby it was shown that it lay in His power to be seen or not seen; and this belongs to a glorified body, as stated above (54, 1, ad 2, 2, ad 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Each separate argument would not suffice of itself for showing perfectly <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's Resurrection</a>, yet all taken collectively establish it completely, especially owing to the testimonies of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, the sayings of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and even <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> own assertion supported by <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. As to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who appeared, they did not say they were men, as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> asserted that He was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a man. Moreover, the manner of eating was different in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>: for since the bodies assumed by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were neither living nor animated, there was no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> eating, although the food was really masticated and passed into the interior of the assumed body: hence the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> said to <a href="../cathen/14749c.htm">Tobias</a> (<a href="../bible/tob012.htm#verse18">12:18-19</a>): "When I was with you . . . I seemed indeed to eat and drink with you; but I use an invisible meat." But since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> animated, His eating was genuine. For, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> observes (De Civ. Dei xiii), "it is not the power but the need of eating that shall be taken away from the bodies of them who rise again." Hence <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> says on <a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse41">Luke 24:41</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> ate because He could, not because He needed."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As was observed above, some <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> were employed by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and others to show forth His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in rising again. But the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as considered in itself, namely, as to its present state, is opposite to the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, as is said in <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse43">1 Corinthians 15:43</a>: "It is sown in weakness, it shall rise in power." Consequently, the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> brought forward for showing the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, seem to be in opposition to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, not absolutely, but according to the present state, and conversely. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xxvi in Evang.): "The Lord manifested two wonders, which are mutually contrary according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, when after the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> He showed His body as incorruptible and at the same time palpable."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. cxxi super Joan.), "these words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>, 'Do not touch Me, for I am not yet <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended</a> to My Father,'" show "that in that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> there is a figure of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, which did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> until He was <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended</a> to the Father. Or <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> would have men to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, i.e. to touch Him spiritually, as being Himself one with the Father. For to that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> innermost perceptions He is, in some sort, <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended</a> unto the Father, who has become so far proficient in Him, as to recognize in Him the equal with the Father . . . whereas she as yet <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Him but carnally, since she wept for Him as for a man." But when one reads elsewhere of Mary having touched Him, when with the other <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, she "'came up and took hold of His feet,' that matters little," as Severianus says [Chrysologus, Serm. lxxvi, "for, the first act relates to figure, the other to sex; the former is of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a>, the latter of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." Or as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. lxxxvi in Joan.): "This <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> wanted to converse with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> just as before the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, and out of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> was thinking of nothing great, although <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh had become much nobler by rising again." And therefore He said: "I have not yet <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended</a> to My Father"; as if to say: "Do not suppose I am leading an earthly life; for if you see Me upon earth, it is because I have not yet <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended</a> to My Father, but I am going to <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascend</a> shortly." Hence He goes on to say: "I <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascend</a> to My Father, and to your Father."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says ad Orosium (Dial. lxv, Qq.): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> rose in clarified flesh; yet He did not wish to appear before the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> in that <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of clarity, because their eyes could not gaze upon that brilliancy. For if before He died for us and rose again the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> could not look upon Him when He was transfigured upon the mountain, how much less were they able to gaze upon Him when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> flesh was glorified." It must also be borne in mind that after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> wished especially to show that He was the same as had died; which the manifestation of His brightness would have hindered considerably: because change of features shows more than anything else the difference in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> seen: and this is because sight specially judges of the common sensibles, among which is one and many, or the same and different. But before the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, lest His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> might despise its weakness, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> meant to show them the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His majesty; and this the brightness of the body specially indicates. Consequently, before the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> He showed the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> by brightness, but after the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> by other tokens.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Consens. Evang. iii): "We can understand one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to have been seen by the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, according to both Matthew and Mark, if we take them as having entered the sepulchre, that is, into some sort of walled enclosure, and that there they saw an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> sitting upon the stone which was rolled back from the monument, as Matthew says; and that this is Mark's expression--'sitting on the right side'; afterwards when they scanned the spot where the Lord's body had lain, they beheld two <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who were at first seated, as John says, and who afterwards rose so as to be seen standing, as Luke relates."
