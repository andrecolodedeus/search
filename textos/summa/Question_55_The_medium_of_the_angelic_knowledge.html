<h1>Question 55. The medium of the angelic knowledge</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1055.htm#article1"> Do the angels know everything by their substance, or by some species?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1055.htm#article2"> If by species, is it by connatural species, or is it by such as they have derived from things?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1055.htm#article3"> Do the higher angels know by more universal species than the lower angels?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the angels know all things by their substance?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things by their <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. For <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. vii) that "the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, according to the proper <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a mind, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the things which are happening upon earth." But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is his <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> things by his <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. xii, text. 51; De Anima iii, text. 15), "in things which are without <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the same as the object understood." But the object understood is the same as the one who understands it, as regards that whereby it is understood. Therefore in things without <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, such as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, the medium whereby the object is understood is the very <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the one understanding it.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, everything which is contained in another is there according to the mode of the container. But an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> has an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore whatever is in him is there in an intelligible mode. But all things are in him: because the lower orders of beings are <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> in the higher, while the higher are in the lower participatively: and therefore <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "enfolds the whole in the whole," i.e. all in all. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things in his <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that "the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are enlightened by the forms of things." Therefore they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by the forms of things, and not by their own <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The medium through which the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands, is compared to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understanding it as its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, because it is by the form that the agent acts. Now in order that the faculty may be perfectly completed by the form, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for all things to which the faculty extends to be contained under the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Hence it is that in things which are corruptible, the form does not perfectly complete the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: because the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> extends to more things than are contained under this or that form. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> power of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> extends to understanding all things: because the object of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is universal being or universal <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, however, does not comprise all things in itself, since it is an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> restricted to a genus and <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. This is proper to the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, simply and perfectly to comprise all things in Itself. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things by His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. But an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things by his <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; and his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> must be perfected by some <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in order to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> When it is said that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> things according to his own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the words "according to" do not determine the medium of such <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, since the medium is the similitude of the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; but they denote the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> power, which belongs to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of his own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As the sense in act is the sensible in act, as stated in De Anima ii, text. 53, not so that the sensitive power is the sensible object's likeness contained in the sense, but because one thing is made from both as from act and <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>: so likewise the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in act is said to be the thing understood in act, not that the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is itself the similitude by which it understands, but because that similitude is its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Now, it is precisely the same thing to say "in things which are without <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the same thing as the object understood," as to say that "the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in act is the thing understood in act"; for a thing is actually understood, precisely because it is immaterial.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The things which are beneath the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, and those which are above him, are in a measure in his <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, not indeed perfectly, nor according to their own proper formality--because the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, as being finite, is distinguished by its own formality from other things--but according to some common formality. Yet all things are perfectly and according to their own formality in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, as in the first and universal operative power, from which proceeds whatever is proper or common to anything. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has a proper <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all things by His own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>: and this the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> has not, but only a common <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the angels understand by species drawn from things?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> understand by <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> drawn from things. For everything understood is apprehended by some likeness within him who understands it. But the likeness of the thing <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in another is there either by way of an exemplar, so that the likeness is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the thing; or else by way of an image, so that it is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by such thing. All <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, then, of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> understanding must either be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the object understood, or else <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by it. Now the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> things; that belongs to the Divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> alone. Therefore it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, by which the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> mind understands, to be derived from things.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> light is stronger than the light of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But the light of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> abstracts intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from phantasms. Therefore the light of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> mind can also abstract <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from sensible things. So there is nothing to hinder us from saying that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> understands through <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> drawn from things.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> are indifferent to what is present or distant, except in so far as they are taken from sensible objects. Therefore, if the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> does not understand by <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> drawn from things, his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> would be indifferent as to things present and distant; and so he would be moved locally to no purpose.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. vii) that the "<a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not gather their Divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from things divisible or sensible."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> whereby the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> understand are not drawn from things, but are connatural to them. For we must observe that there is a similarity between the distinction and order of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> and the distinction and order of corporeal <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. The highest bodies have in their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> a <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> which is fully perfected by the form; whereas in the lower bodies the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is not entirely perfected by the form, but receives from some agent, now one form, now another. In like fashion also the lower <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> --that is to say, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>--have a power of understanding which is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> complete, but is successively completed in them by their drawing intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from things. But in the higher <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>--that is, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>--the power of understanding is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> complete by intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, in so far as they have such <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> connatural to them, so as to understand all things which they can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>.

<p>The same is evident from the manner of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of such <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. The lower <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>--that is, <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>--have a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> akin to a body, in so far as they are the forms of bodies: and consequently from their very mode of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> it behooves them to seek their intelligible perfection from bodies, and through bodies; otherwise they would be united with bodies to no purpose. On the other hand, the higher <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>--that is, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>--are utterly free from bodies, and subsist immaterially and in their own intelligible <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; consequently they attain their intelligible perfection through an intelligible outpouring, whereby they received from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, together with their <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. ii, 8): "The other things which are lower than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are so <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> that they first receive <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the rational creature, and then in their own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> There are images of creatures in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> mind, not, indeed derived from creatures, but from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of creatures, and in Whom the likenesses of creatures first <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. ii, 8) that, "As the type, according to which the creature is fashioned, is in the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> before the creature which is fashioned, so the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the same type <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> first in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> creature, and is afterwards the very fashioning of the creature."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> To go from one extreme to the other it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to pass through the middle. Now the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a form in the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, which form is without <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> but not without material <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>, stands midway between the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a form which is in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a form which is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> by abstraction from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and from material <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>. Consequently, however powerful the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> mind might be, it could not reduce material forms to an intelligible <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, except it were first to reduce them to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagined</a> forms; which is impossible, since the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> has no <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, as was said above (Question 54, Article 5). Even granted that he could abstract intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from material things, yet he would not do so; because he would not need them, for he has connatural intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is quite indifferent as to what is near or distant. Nevertheless his local movement is not purposeless on that account: for he is not moved to a place for the purpose of acquiring <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but for the purpose of operation.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the higher angels understand by more universal species than the lower angels?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the higher <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not understand by more universal <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> than the lower <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For the universal, seemingly, is what is abstracted from particulars. But <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not understand by <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> abstracted from things. Therefore it cannot be said that the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> are more or less universal.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in detail is more perfectly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> than what is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> generically; because to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> anything generically is, in a fashion, midway between <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> and act. If, therefore, the higher <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by more universal <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> than the lower, it follows that the higher have a more imperfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> than the lower; which is not befitting.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the same cannot be the proper type of many. But if the higher <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> various things by one universal form, which the lower <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> by several special forms, it follows that the higher <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> uses one universal form for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> various things. Therefore he will not be able to have a proper <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of each; which seems unbecoming.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. xii) that the higher <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have a more universal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> than the lower. And in De Causis it is said that the higher <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have more universal forms.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> For this reason are some things of a more exalted <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, because they are nearer to and more like unto the first, which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the whole plenitude of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is contained in one thing, that is to say, in the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, by which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things. This plenitude of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is found in <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellects</a> in a lower manner, and less simply. Consequently it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the lower intelligences to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by many forms what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> by one, and by so many forms the more according as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is lower.

<p>Thus the higher the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is, by so much the fewer <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> will he be able to apprehend the whole mass of intelligible objects. Therefore his forms must be more universal; each one of them, as it were, extending to more things. An example of this can in some measure be observed in ourselves. For some people there are who cannot grasp an intelligible <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, unless it be explained to them in every part and detail; this comes of their weakness of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>: while there are others of stronger <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, who can grasp many things from few.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to the universal to be abstracted from particulars, in so far as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it derives its <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from things. But if there be an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> which does not derive its <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from things, the universal which it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> will not be abstracted from things, but in a measure will be pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> to them; either according to the order of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>, as the universal <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of things are in the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>; or at least in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as the universal <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of things are in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> mind.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> To <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> anything universally can be taken in two senses. In one way, on the part of the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, namely, that only the universal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the thing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. To <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> a thing thus is something less perfect: for he would have but an imperfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of a man who only <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> him to be an animal. In another way, on the part of the medium of such <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. In this way it is more perfect to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> a thing in the universal; for the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which by one universal medium can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> each of the things which are properly contained in it, is more perfect than one which cannot.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The same cannot be the proper and adequate type of several things. But if it be eminent, then it can be taken as the proper type and likeness of many. Just as in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, there is a universal <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> with respect to all the acts of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; which can be taken as the proper type and likeness of that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> which in the lion leads to acts of magnanimity, and in the fox to acts of wariness; and so on of the rest. The Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, on account of Its eminence, is in like fashion taken as the proper type of each thing contained therein: hence each one is likened to It according to its proper type. The same applies to the universal form which is in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, so that, on account of its excellence, many things can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through it with a proper <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.
