<h1>Question 55. The virtues, as to their essence</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2055.htm#article1"> Is human virtue a habit?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2055.htm#article2"> Is it an operative habit?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2055.htm#article3"> Is it a good habit?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2055.htm#article4"> The definition of virtue</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether human virtue is a habit?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>: For <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is "the limit of power" (De Coelo i, text. 116). But the limit of anything is reducible to the genus of that of which it is the limit; as a point is reducible to the genus of line. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is reducible to the genus of power, and not to the genus of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Lib. Arb. ii) [Retract. ix; cf. De Lib. Arb. ii, 19 that "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> use of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>." But use of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is an act. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, but an act.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, we do not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> by our <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, but by our actions: otherwise a man would <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> continually, even while asleep. But we do <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> by our <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, but acts.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Moribus Eccl. xv) that "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is the order of love," and (QQ. lxxxiii, qu. 30) that "the ordering which is called <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> consists in enjoying what we ought to enjoy, and using what we ought to use." Now order, or ordering, denominates either an action or a relation. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, but an action or a relation.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, just as there are <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, so are there <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. But <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, but powers. Neither therefore are <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Categor. vi) that science and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Virtue denotes a certain perfection of a power. Now a thing's perfection is considered chiefly in regard to its end. But the end of power is act. Wherefore power is said to be perfect, according as it is determinate to its act.

<p>Now there are some powers which of themselves are determinate to their acts; for instance, the active <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers. And therefore these <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers are in themselves called <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. But the rational powers, which are proper to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, are not determinate to one particular action, but are inclined indifferently to many: and they are determinate to acts by means of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, as is clear from what we have said above (Question 49, Article 4). Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Sometimes we give the name of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to that to which the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is directed, namely, either to its object, or to its act: for instance, we give the name <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, to that which we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, or to the act of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a>, as also to the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> by which we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. When therefore we say that "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is the limit of power," <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is taken for the object of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For the furthest point to which a power can reach, is said to be its <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; for instance, if a man can carry a hundredweight and not more, his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> [In English we should say 'strength,' which is the original signification of the <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> 'virtus': thus we speak of an engine being so many horse-power, to indicate its 'strength'] is put at a hundredweight, and not at sixty. But the objection takes <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> as being <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> the limit of power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Good use of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is said to be a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, in the same sense as above (ad 1); that is to say, because it is that to which <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is directed as to its proper act. For the act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is nothing else than the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> use of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> We are said to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> by something in two ways. First, as by <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> itself, just as we are said to run by running; and thus we <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> by acts. Secondly, we are said to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> by something as by the principle whereby we <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, as we are said to run by the motive power; and thus are we said to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> by <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> When we say that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is the order or ordering of love, we refer to the end to which <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is ordered: because in us love is set in order by <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Natural powers are of themselves determinate to one act: not so the rational powers. And so there is no comparison, as we have said.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether human virtue is an operative habit?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to be an operative <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. For Tully says (Tuscul. iv) that as health and beauty belong to the body, so <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But health and beauty are not operative <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>. Therefore neither is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things we find <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> not only in reference to act, but also in reference to being: as is clear from the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Coelo i), since some have a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to be always, while some have a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to be not always, but at some definite time. Now as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things, so is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in rational beings. Therefore also <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is referred not only to act, but also to being.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Phys. vii, text. 17) that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> "is the disposition of a perfect thing to that which is best." Now the best thing to which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs to be disposed by <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> proves (De Moribus Eccl. 3,6, 14) to Whom the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is disposed by being made like to Him. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in reference to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, likening it, as it were, to Him; and not in reference to operation. It is not, therefore, an operative <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. ii, 6) says that "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of a thing is that which makes its work <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Virtue, from the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the word, implies some perfection of power, as we have said above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Wherefore, since power [The one <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> word 'potentia' is rendered '<a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>' in the first case, and 'power' in the second] is of two kinds, namely, power in reference to being, and power in reference to act; the perfection of each of these is called <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But power in reference to being is on the part of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a> being, whereas power in reference to act, is on the part of the form, which is the principle of action, since everything acts in so far as it is in act.

<p>Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is so constituted that the body holds the place of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that of form. The body, indeed, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has in common with other animals; and the same is to be said of the forces which are common to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body: and only those forces which are proper to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, namely, the rational forces, belong to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> alone. And therefore, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, of which we are speaking now, cannot belong to the body, but belongs only to that which is proper to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> does not imply reference to being, but rather to act. Consequently it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to be an operative <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Mode of action follows on the disposition of the agent: for such as a thing is, such is its act. And therefore, since <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is the principle of some kind of operation, there must needs pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the operator in respect of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> some corresponding disposition. Now <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> an ordered operation. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> itself is an ordered disposition of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in so far as, to wit, the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are in some way ordered to one another, and to that which is outside. Hence <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, inasmuch as it is a suitable disposition of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, is like health and beauty, which are suitable dispositions of the body. But this does not hinder <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> from being a principle of operation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Virtue which is referred to being is not proper to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; but only that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which is referred to works of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, which are proper to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is His act, the highest likeness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in respect of some operation. Wherefore, as we have said above (Question 3, Article 2), <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> or bliss by which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is made most perfectly conformed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and which is the end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, consists in an operation.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether human virtue is a good habit?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that it should be a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. For <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is always taken in a bad sense. But there is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> even of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; according to <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse56">1 Corinthians 15:56</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'strength'] of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not always a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, Virtue corresponds to power. But power is not only referred to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but also to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: according to <a href="../bible/isa005.htm">Isaiah 5</a>: "Woe to you that are mighty to drink wine, and stout men at drunkenness." Therefore <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> also is referred to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse9">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>): "Virtue [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'power'] is made perfect in infirmity." But infirmity is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is referred not only to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but also to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Moribus Eccl. vi): "No one can <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> makes the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> exceeding <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>": and the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 6): "Virtue is that which makes its possessor <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and his work <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> likewise."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As we have said above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> implies a perfection of power: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of a thing is fixed by the limit of its power (De Coelo i). Now the limit of any power must needs be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: for all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> implies defect; wherefore <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Hom. ii) that every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is a weakness. And for this reason the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of a thing must be regarded in reference to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which is an operative <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, productive of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Just as bad things are said metaphorically to be perfect, so are they said to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: for we speak of a perfect <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a> or robber; and of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a> or robber, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> explains (Metaph. v, text. 21). In this way therefore <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is applied to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things: so that the "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>" of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is said to be <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, in so far as occasionally <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is aggravated through the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, so as to attain to the limit of its possibility.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of drunkenness and excessive drink, consists in a falling away from the order of reason. Now it happens that, together with this falling away from reason, some lower power is perfect in reference to that which belongs to its own kind, even in direct opposition to reason, or with some falling away therefrom. But the perfection of that power, since it is compatible with a falling away from reason, cannot be called a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason</a> is shown to be so much the more perfect, according as it is able to overcome or endure more easily the weakness of the body and of the lower powers. And therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which is attributed to reason, is said to be "made perfect in infirmity," not of the reason indeed, but of the body and of the lower powers.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether virtue is suitably defined?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the definition, usually given, of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, is not suitable, to wit: "Virtue is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, by which we live righteously, of which no one can make bad use, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> works in us, without us." For <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, since <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> it is that makes its subject <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> does not seem to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as neither is whiteness white. It is therefore unsuitable to describe <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> as a "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no difference is more common than its genus; since it is that which divides the genus. But <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is more common than <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, since it is convertible with being. Therefore "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" should not be put in the definition of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as a difference of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xii, 3): "When we come across anything that is not common to us and the beasts of the field, it is something appertaining to the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>." But there are <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> even of the irrational parts; as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 10). Every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, therefore, is not a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> "of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, righteousness seems to belong to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; whence the righteous are called just. But <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. It is therefore unsuitable to put "righteous" in the definition of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, when we say that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is that "by which we live righteously."

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, whoever is <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> of a thing, makes bad use of it. But many are <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in his Rule, that "<a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> lies in wait for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works in order to slay them." It is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>, therefore, "that no one can make bad use of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is justified by <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse11">John 15:11</a>: "He shall do greater things than these," says [Tract. xxvii in Joan.: Serm. xv de Verb. Ap. 11: "He who <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> thee without thee, will not justify thee without thee." It is therefore unsuitable to say that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> works <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in us, without us."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> We have the authority of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> from whose words this definition is gathered, and principally in De Libero Arbitrio ii, 19.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> This definition comprises perfectly the whole <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> notion of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For the perfect <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> notion of anything is gathered from all its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. Now the above definition comprises all the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">formal</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as of everything, is gathered from its genus and difference, when it is defined as "a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>": for "<a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>" is the genus of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and the difference, "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." But the definition would be more suitable if for "<a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>" we substitute "<a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>," which is the proximate genus.

<p>Now <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> has no <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> "out of which" it is formed, as neither has any other <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>; but it has <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> "about which" it is concerned, and <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> "in which" it exits, namely, the subject. The <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> about which <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is concerned is its object, and this could not be included in the above definition, because the object fixes the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to a certain <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and here we are giving the definition of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in general. And so for material <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> we have the subject, which is mentioned when we say that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> "of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>."

<p>The end of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since it is an operative <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, is operation. But it must be observed that some operative <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are always referred to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>: others are sometimes referred to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, sometimes to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; for instance, opinion is referred both to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and to the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>: whereas <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> which is always referred to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: and so the distinction of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> from those <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> which are always referred to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, is expressed in the words "by which we live righteously": and its distinction from those <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> which are sometimes directed unto <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, sometimes unto <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, in the words, "of which no one makes bad use."

<p>Lastly, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of infused <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, to which this definition applies; and this is expressed in the words "which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> works in us without us." If we omit this phrase, the remainder of the definition will apply to all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in general, whether acquired or infused.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> That which is first seized by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is being: wherefore everything that we apprehend we consider as being, and consequently as gone, and as <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which are convertible with being. Wherefore we say that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is being and is one and is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and that oneness is being and one and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: and in like manner <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. But this is not the case with specific forms, as whiteness and health; for everything that we apprehend, is not apprehended with the notion of white and healthy. We must, however, observe that, as <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> and non-subsistent forms are called beings, not as if they themselves had being, but because things are by them; so also are they called <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or one, not by some distinct <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or oneness, but because by them something is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or one. So also is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> called <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, because by it something is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Good, which is put in the definition of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, is not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in general which is convertible with being, and which extends further than <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as fixed by reason, with regard to which <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) "that the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is to be in accord with reason."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Virtue cannot be in the irrational part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, except in so far as this participates in the reason (Ethic. i, 13). And therefore reason, or the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, is the proper subject of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Justice has a righteousness of its own by which it puts those outward things right which come into <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> use, and are the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as we shall show further on (60, 2; II-II, 58, 8). But the righteousness which denotes order to a due end and to the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, which is the rule of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will, as stated above (Question 19, Article 4), is common to all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> One can make bad use of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> objectively, for instance by having <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thoughts about a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, e.g. by hating it, or by being <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> of it: but one cannot make bad use of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> as principle of action, so that an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> Infused <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in us by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> without any action on our part, but not without our consent. This is the sense of the words, "which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> works in us without us." As to those things which are done by us, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> them in us, yet not without action on our part, for He works in every will and in every <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.
