<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether prudence of the flesh is a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of the flesh is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is more excellent than the other moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, since it governs them all. But no <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> or <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. Neither therefore is any <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to act prudently for an end which it is lawful to love. But it is lawful to love the flesh, "for no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ever <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> his own flesh" (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse29">Ephesians 5:29</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of the flesh is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is tempted by the flesh, so too is he tempted by the world and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. But no <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of the world, or of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is accounted a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore neither should any <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of the flesh be accounted among <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is an enemy to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> save for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> according to <a href="../bible/wis014.htm#verse9">Wisdom 14:9</a>, "To <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> are hateful alike." Now it is written (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse7">Romans 8:7</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'wisdom'] of the flesh is an enemy to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of the flesh is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 47, Article 13), <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> regards things which are directed to the end of life as a whole. Hence <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of the flesh signifies properly the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of a man who looks upon carnal goods as the last end of his life. Now it is evident that this is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because it involves a disorder in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with respect to his last end, which does not consist in the goods of the body, as stated above (I-II, 02, 5). Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of the flesh is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Justice and <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> include in their very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that which ranks them among the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, viz. equality and the curbing of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>; hence they are never taken in a bad sense. On the other hand <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is so called from foreseeing [providendo], as stated above (47, 1; 49, 6), which can extend to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things also. Therefore, although <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is taken simply in a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> sense, yet, if something be added, it may be taken in a bad sense: and it is thus that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of the flesh is said to be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The flesh is on account of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is on account of the form, and the instrument on account of the principal agent. Hence the flesh is loved lawfully, if it be directed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as its end. If, however, a man place his last end in a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the flesh, his love will be inordinate and unlawful, and it is thus that the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of the flesh is directed to the love of the flesh.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> tempts us, not through the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the appetible object, but by way of suggestion. Wherefore, since <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> implies direction to some appetible end, we do not speak of "<a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>," as of a <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> directed to some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> end, which is the aspect under which the world and the flesh <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> us, in so far as worldly or carnal goods are proposed to our <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Hence we speak of "carnal" and again of "worldly" <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, according to <a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse8">Luke 16:8</a>, "The children of this world are more <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'wiser'] in their generation," etc. The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> includes all in the "<a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of the flesh," because we covet the external things of the world on account of the flesh.

<p>We may also reply that since <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is in a certain sense called "wisdom," as stated above (47, 2, ad 1), we may distinguish a threefold <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> corresponding to the three kinds of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/jam003.htm#verse15">James 3:15</a>) that there is a wisdom which is "earthly, sensual and devilish," as explained above (45, 1, ad 1), when we were treating of wisdom.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether prudence of the flesh is a mortal sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of the flesh is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For it is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to rebel against the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, since this implies contempt of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now "the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'wisdom'] of the flesh . . . is not subject to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse7">Romans 8:7</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of the flesh is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of the flesh seems to be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, for "it cannot be subject to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse7">Romans 8:7</a>), and so it seems to be an unpardonable <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is proper to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of the flesh is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the greatest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is opposed to the greatest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as stated in Ethic. viii, 10. Now <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of the flesh is opposed to that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> which is the chief of the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of the flesh is chief among mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, so that it is itself a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> That which diminishes a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has not of itself the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now the thoughtful quest of things pertaining to the care of the flesh, which seems to pertain to carnal <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, diminishes <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> [Cf. <a href="../bible/pro006.htm#verse30">Proverbs 6:30</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of the flesh has not of itself the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (47, 2, ad 1; 13), a man is said to be <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> in two ways. First, simply, i.e. in relation to the end of life as a whole. Secondly, relatively, i.e. in relation to some particular end; thus a man is said to be <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> in business or something else of the kind. Accordingly if <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of the flesh be taken as corresponding to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> in its absolute signification, so that a man place the last end of his whole life in the care of the flesh, it is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because he turns away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by so doing, since he cannot have several last ends, as stated above (I-II, 01, 5).

<p>If, on the other hand, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of the flesh be taken as corresponding to particular <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, it is a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For it happens sometimes that a man has an inordinate affection for some pleasure of the flesh, without turning away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; in which case he does not place the end of his whole life in carnal pleasure. To apply oneself to obtain this pleasure is a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and pertains to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of the flesh. But if a man actually refers the care of the flesh to a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> end, as when one is careful about one's food in order to sustain one's body, this is no longer <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of the flesh, because then one uses the care of the flesh as a means to an end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> is speaking of that carnal <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> whereby a man places the end of his whole life in the goods of the flesh, and this is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">Prudence</a> of the flesh does not imply a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. For when it is stated that "it cannot be subject to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," this does not mean that he who has <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of the flesh, cannot be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> and submit to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but that carnal <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> itself cannot be subject to <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">God's law</a>, even as neither can <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> be <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, nor heat cold, although that which is hot may become cold.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is opposed to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, just as <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is shared by every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But it does not follow that every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> opposed to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is most grave, but only when it is opposed to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> in some very grave <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether craftiness is a special sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that craftiness is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For the words of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> do not induce anyone to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and yet they induce us to be crafty, according to <a href="../bible/pro001.htm#verse4">Proverbs 1:4</a>, "To give craftiness [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'subtlety'] to little ones." Therefore craftiness is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/pro013.htm#verse16">Proverbs 13:16</a>): "The crafty [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: '<a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>'] <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> doth all things with counsel." Therefore, he does so either for a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or for an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> end. If for a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> end, there is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> seemingly, and if for an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> end, it would seem to pertain to carnal or worldly <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Therefore craftiness is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> distinct from <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of the flesh.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> expounding the words of <a href="../bible/job012.htm">Job 12</a>, "The simplicity of the just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is laughed to scorn," says (Moral. x, 29): "The wisdom of this world is to hide one's thoughts by artifice, to conceal one's meaning by words, to represent <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, to make out the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>," and further on he adds: "This <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is acquired by the young, it is learnt at a price by children." Now the above things seem to belong to craftiness. Therefore craftiness is not distinct from carnal or worldly <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and consequently it seems not to be a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse2">2 Corinthians 4:2</a>): "We renounce the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor adulterating the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore craftiness is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">Prudence</a> is "right reason applied to action," just as science is "right reason applied to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>." On speculative matters one may <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against rectitude of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in two ways: in one way when the reason is led to a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> conclusion that appears to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; in another way when the reason proceeds from <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> premises, that appear to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, either to a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> or to a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> conclusion. Even so a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may be against <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, through having some resemblance thereto, in two ways. First, when the purpose of the reason is directed to an end which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> not in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> but in appearance, and this pertains to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of the flesh; secondly, when, in order to obtain a certain end, whether <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, a man uses means that are not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> but fictitious and counterfeit, and this belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of craftiness. This is consequently a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> opposed to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and distinct from <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of the flesh.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> observes (Contra Julian. iv, 3) just as <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is sometimes improperly taken in a bad sense, so is craftiness sometimes taken in a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> sense, and this on account of their mutual resemblance. Properly speaking, however, craftiness is taken in a bad sense, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states in Ethic. vi, 12.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Craftiness can take counsel both for a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> end and for an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> end: nor should a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> end be pursued by means that are <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> and counterfeit but by such as are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Hence craftiness is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> if it be directed to a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Under "worldly <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>" <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> included everything that can pertain to <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, so that it comprises craftiness also.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether guile is a sin pertaining to craftiness?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that guile is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> pertaining to craftiness. For <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, especially mortal, has no place in perfect men. Yet a certain guile is to be found in them, according to <a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse16">2 Corinthians 12:16</a>, "Being crafty I caught you by guile." Therefore guile is not always a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, guile seems to pertain chiefly to the tongue, according to <a href="../bible/psa005.htm#verse11">Psalm 5:11</a>, "They dealt deceitfully with their tongues." Now craftiness like <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is in the very <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Therefore guile does not pertain to craftiness.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/pro012.htm#verse20">Proverbs 12:20</a>): "Guile [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'Deceit'] is in the heart of them that think <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things." But the thought of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things does not always pertain to craftiness. Therefore guile does not seem to belong to craftiness.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Craftiness aims at lying in wait, according to <a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse14">Ephesians 4:14</a>, "By cunning craftiness by which they lie in wait to deceive": and guile aims at this also. Therefore guile pertains to craftiness.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), it belongs to craftiness to adopt ways that are not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> but counterfeit and apparently <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, in order to attain some end either <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Now the adopting of such ways may be subjected to a twofold consideration; first, as regards the process of thinking them out, and this belongs properly to craftiness, even as thinking out right ways to a due end belongs to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Secondly the adopting of such like ways may be considered with regard to their actual execution, and in this way it belongs to guile. Hence guile denotes a certain execution of craftiness, and accordingly belongs thereto.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Just as craftiness is taken properly in a bad sense, and improperly in a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> sense, so too is guile which is the execution of craftiness.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The execution of craftiness with the purpose of deceiving, is effected first and foremost by words, which hold the chief place among those signs whereby a man signifies something to another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Doctr. Christ. ii, 3), hence guile is ascribed chiefly to speech. Yet guile may happen also in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa104.htm#verse25">Psalm 104:25</a>, "And to deal deceitfully with his servants." Guile is also in the heart, according to <a href="../bible/sir019.htm#verse23">Sirach 19:23</a>, "His interior is full of deceit," but this is to devise deceits, according to <a href="../bible/psa037.htm#verse13">Psalm 37:13</a>: "They studied deceits all the day long."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Whoever purposes to do some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, must needs devise certain ways of attaining his purpose, and for the most part he devises deceitful ways, whereby the more easily to obtain his end. Nevertheless it happens sometimes that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is done openly and by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> without craftiness and guile; but as this is more difficult, it is of less frequent occurrence.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether fraud pertains to craftiness?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> does not pertain to craftiness. For a man does not deserve praise if he allows himself to be deceived, which is the object of craftiness; and yet a man deserves praise for allowing himself to be defrauded, according to <a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse1">1 Corinthians 6:1</a>, "Why do you not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?" Therefore <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> does not belong to craftiness.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> seems to consist in unlawfully taking or receiving external things, for it is written (<a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse1">Acts 5:1</a>) that "a certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> named Ananias with Saphira his wife, sold a piece of land, and by <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> kept back part of the price of the land." Now it pertains to <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> or illiberality to take possession of or retain external things <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> does not belong to craftiness which is opposed to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> employs craftiness against himself. But the frauds of some are against themselves, for it is written (<a href="../bible/pro001.htm#verse18">Proverbs 1:18</a>) concerning some "that they practice frauds [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'deceits'] against their own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> does not belong to craftiness.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The object of <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> is to deceive, according to <a href="../bible/job013.htm#verse9">Job 13:9</a>, "Shall he be deceived as a man, with your fraudulent [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'deceitful'] dealings?" Now craftiness is directed to the same object. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> pertains to craftiness.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Just as "guile" consists in the execution of craftiness, so also does "<a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a>." But they seem to differ in the fact that "guile" belongs in general to the execution of craftiness, whether this be effected by words, or by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, whereas "<a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a>" belongs more properly to the execution of craftiness by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> does not counsel the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to be deceived in their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but to bear patiently the effect of being deceived, and to endure wrongs inflicted on them by <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The execution of craftiness may be carried out by another <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, just as the execution of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: and accordingly nothing hinders <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> from pertaining to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> or illiberality.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Those who commit frauds, do not design anything against themselves or their own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; it is through <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> just judgment that what they plot against others, recoils on themselves, according to <a href="../bible/psa007.htm#verse16">Psalm 7:16</a>, "He is fallen into the hole he made."

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether it is lawful to be solicitous about temporal matters?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem lawful to be solicitous about temporal matters. Because a superior should be solicitous for his subjects, according to <a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse8">Romans 12:8</a>, "He that ruleth, with solicitude." Now according to the Divine ordering, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is placed over temporal things, according to <a href="../bible/psa008.htm#verse8">Psalm 8:8</a>, "Thou hast subjected all things under his feet," etc. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be solicitous about temporal things.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, everyone is solicitous about the end for which he works. Now it is lawful for a man to work for the temporal things whereby he sustains life, wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/2th003.htm#verse10">2 Thessalonians 3:10</a>): "If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will not work, neither let him eat." Therefore it is lawful to be solicitous about temporal things.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, solicitude about <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">works of mercy</a> is praiseworthy, according to <a href="../bible/2ti001.htm#verse17">2 Timothy 1:17</a>, "When he was come to Rome, he carefully sought me." Now solicitude about temporal things is sometimes connected with <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">works of mercy</a>; for instance, when a man is solicitous to watch over the interests of orphans and poor <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Therefore solicitude about temporal things is not unlawful.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse31">Matthew 6:31</a>): "Be not solicitous . . . saying, What shall we eat, or what shall we drink, or wherewith shall we be clothed?" And yet such things are very <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Solicitude denotes an earnest endeavor to obtain something. Now it is evident that the endeavor is more earnest when there is fear of failure, so that there is less solicitude when success is assured. Accordingly solicitude about temporal things may be unlawful in three ways. First on the part of the object of solicitude; that is, if we seek temporal things as an end. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Operibus Monach. xxvi): "When <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said: 'Be not solicitous,' etc. . . . He intended to forbid them either to make such things their end, or for the sake of these things to do whatever they were commanded to do in preaching the Gospel." Secondly, solicitude about temporal things may be unlawful, through too much earnestness in endeavoring to obtain temporal things, the result being that a man is drawn away from <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things which ought to be the chief object of his search, wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse22">Matthew 13:22</a>) that "the care of this world . . . chokes up the word." Thirdly, through over much fear, when, to wit, a man <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> to lack <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> things if he do what he ought to do. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> gives three motives for laying aside this fear. First, on account of the yet greater favors bestowed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, independently of his solicitude, viz. his body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> (<a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse26">Matthew 6:26</a>); secondly, on account of the care with which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> watches over animals and plants without the assistance of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, according to the requirements of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; thirdly, because of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a>, through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of which the gentiles are solicitous in seeking temporal goods before all others. Consequently He concludes that we should be solicitous most of all about <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods, hoping that temporal goods also may be granted us according to our needs, if we do what we ought to do.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Temporal goods are subjected to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that he may use them according to his needs, not that he may place his end in them and be over solicitous about them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The solicitude of a man who gains his bread by bodily labor is not superfluous but proportionate; hence <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on <a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse31">Matthew 6:31</a>, "Be not solicitous," that "labor is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, but solicitude must be banished," namely superfluous solicitude which unsettles the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">works of mercy</a> solicitude about temporal things is directed to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> as its end, wherefore it is not unlawful, unless it be superfluous.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether we should be solicitous about the future?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that we should be solicitous about the future. For it is written (<a href="../bible/pro006.htm#verse6">Proverbs 6:6-8</a>): "Go to the ant, O sluggard, and consider her ways and learn wisdom; which, although she hath no guide, nor master . . . provideth her meat for herself in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest." Now this is to be solicitous about the future. Therefore solicitude about the future is praiseworthy.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, solicitude pertains to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. But <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is chiefly about the future, since its principal part is "foresight of future things," as stated above (49, 6, ad 1). Therefore it is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> to be solicitous about the future.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whoever puts something by that he may keep it for the morrow, is solicitous about the future. Now we read (<a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse6">John 12:6</a>) that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had a bag for keeping things in, which <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> carried, and (<a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse34">Acts 4:34-37</a>) that the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostles</a> kept the price of the land, which had been laid at their feet. Therefore it is lawful to be solicitous about the future.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse34">Matthew 6:34</a>): "Be not . . . solicitous for tomorrow"; where "tomorrow" stands for the future, as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says in his commentary on this passage.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> No work can be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, unless it be vested with its due circumstances, and among these is the due time, according to <a href="../bible/ecc008.htm#verse6">Ecclesiastes 8:6</a>, "There is a time and opportunity for every business"; which applies not only to external <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> but also to internal solicitude. For every time has its own fitting proper solicitude; thus solicitude about the crops belongs to the summer time, and solicitude about the vintage to the time of autumn. Accordingly if a man were solicitous about the vintage during the summer, he would be needlessly forestalling the solicitude belonging to a future time. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> forbids such like excessive solicitude, saying: "Be . . . not solicitous for tomorrow," wherefore He adds, "for the morrow will be solicitous for itself," that is to say, the morrow will have its own solicitude, which will be burden enough for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. This is what He means by adding: "Sufficient for the day is the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thereof," namely, the burden of solicitude.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The ant is solicitous at a befitting time, and it is this that is proposed for our example.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Due foresight of the future belongs to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. But it would be an inordinate foresight or solicitude about the future, if a man were to seek temporal things, to which the terms "past" and "future" apply, as ends, or if he were to seek them in excess of the needs of the present life, or if he were to forestall the time for solicitude.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 17), "when we see a servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> taking thought lest he lack these needful things, we must not judge him to be solicitous for the morrow, since even <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> deigned for our example to have a purse, and we read in the <a href="../cathen/01117a.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a> that they procured the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> means of livelihood in view of the future on account of a threatened famine. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> does not condemn those who according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> custom, provide themselves with such things, but those who oppose themselves to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the sake of these things."

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether these vices arise from covetousness?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that these <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> do not arise from <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>. As stated above (Question 43, Article 6) <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is the chief <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of lack of rectitude in the reason. Now these <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are opposed to right reason, i.e. to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Therefore they arise chiefly from <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>; especially since the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 6) that "Venus is full of guile and her girdle is many colored" and that "he who is incontinent in desire acts with cunning."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, these <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> bear a certain resemblance to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, as stated above (Question 47, Article 13). Now, since <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is in the reason, the more <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> seem to be more akin thereto, such as <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and vainglory. Therefore the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> seem to arise from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> rather than from <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, men make use of stratagems not only in laying hold of other people's goods, but also in plotting murders, the former of which pertains to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, and the latter to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. Now the use of stratagems pertains to craftiness, guile, and <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a>. Therefore the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> arise not only from <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, but also from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi, 45) states that <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> is a daughter of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (3; 47, 13), carnal <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and craftiness, as well as guile and <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a>, bear a certain resemblance to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> in some kind of use of the reason. Now among all the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> it is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> wherein the use of right reason appears chiefly, for <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is in the rational <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Hence the undue use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> appears chiefly in the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> opposed to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, the chief of which is <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>. Therefore the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> arise chiefly from <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> On account of the vehemence of pleasure and of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> entirely suppresses the reason from exercising its act: whereas in the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> there is some use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, albeit inordinate. Hence these <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> do not arise directly from <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. When the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says that "Venus is full of guile," he is referring to a certain resemblance, in so far as she carries <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> away suddenly, just as he is moved in deceitful actions, yet not by means of craftiness but rather by the vehemence of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> and pleasure; wherefore he adds that "Venus doth cozen the wits of the wisest <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" [Cf. Iliad xiv, 214-217.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> To do anything by stratagem seems to be due to pusillanimity: because a magnanimous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> wishes to act openly, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 3). Wherefore, as <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> resembles or apes magnanimity, it follows that the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> which make use of <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> and guile, do not arise directly from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, but rather from <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, which seeks its own profit and sets little by excellence.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Anger's movement is sudden, hence it acts with precipitation, and without counsel, contrary to the use of the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, though these use counsel inordinately. That men use stratagems in plotting murders, arises not from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> but rather from <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> desires to harm manifestly, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Rhet. ii, 2,3) [Cf.
