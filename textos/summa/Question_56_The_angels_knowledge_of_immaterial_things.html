<h1>Question 56. The angel's knowledge of immaterial things</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1056.htm#article1"> Does an angel know himself?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1056.htm#article2"> Does one angel know another?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1056.htm#article3"> Does the angel know God by his own natural principle?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether an angel knows himself?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> himself. For <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says that "the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> their own powers" (Coel. Hier. vi). But, when the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, the power is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Therefore an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> his own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is a single <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, otherwise he would not act, since acts belong to single subsistences. But nothing single is intelligible. Therefore, since the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> possesses only <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which is <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, no <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> himself.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is moved by the intelligible object: because, as stated in De Anima iii, 4 understanding is a kind of passion. But nothing is moved by or is passive to itself; as appears in corporeal things. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> cannot understand himself.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. ii) that "the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> himself when he was established, that is, enlightened by <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As is evident from what has been previously said (14, 2; 54, 2), the object is on a different footing in an immanent, and in a transient, action. In a transient action the object or <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> into which the action passes is something separate from the agent, as the thing heated is from what gave it heat, and the building from the builder; whereas in an immanent action, for the action to proceed, the object must be united with the agent; just as the sensible object must be in contact with sense, in order that sense may actually perceive. And the object which is united to a faculty bears the same relation to actions of this kind as does the form which is the principle of action in other agents: for, as heat is the formal principle of heating in the fire, so is the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the thing seen the formal principle of sight to the eye.

<p>It must, however, be borne in mind that this image of the object <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> sometimes only <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> faculty; and then there is only <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>; and in order that there may be actual <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, it is required that the faculty of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> be actuated by the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But if it always actually possesses the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, it can thereby have actual <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> without any preceding change or reception. From this it is evident that it is not of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of knower, as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>, to be moved by the object, but as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. Now, for the form to be the principle of the action, it makes no difference whether it be inherent in something else, or self-subsisting; because heat would give forth heat none the less if it were self-subsisting, than it does by inhering in something else. So therefore, if in the order of intelligible beings there be any subsisting intelligible form, it will understand itself. And since an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is immaterial, he is a subsisting form; and, consequently, he is actually intelligible. Hence it follows that he understands himself by his form, which is his <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> That is the text of the old translation, which is amended in the new one, and runs thus: "furthermore they," that is to say the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> their own powers": instead of which the old translation read--"and furthermore they do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> their own powers." Although even the letter of the old translation might be kept in this respect, that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> their own power perfectly; according as it proceeds from the order of the Divine Wisdom, Which to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> is incomprehensible.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> We have no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of single corporeal things, not because of their particularity, but on account of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, which is their principle of individuation. Accordingly, if there be any single things subsisting without <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are, there is nothing to prevent them from being actually intelligible.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It belongs to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, in so far as if is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, to be moved and to be passive. Hence this does not happen in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, especially as regards the fact that he understands himself. Besides the action of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as the action found in corporeal things, which passes into some other <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether one angel knows another?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> another. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii, text. 4), that if the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> were to have in itself any one of the sensible things, then such a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> within it would prevent it from apprehending external things; as likewise, if the pupil of the eye were colored with some particular color, it could not see every color. But as the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is disposed for understanding corporeal things, so is the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> mind for understanding immaterial things. Therefore, since the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> has within itself some one determinate <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> from the number of such <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, it would seem that it cannot understand other <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is stated in De Causis that "every <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what is above it, in so far as it is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by it; and what is beneath it, in so far as it is its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>." But one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of another. Therefore one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> another.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to another <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> by the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>; because all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is effected by way of a likeness. But the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> is not like the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, except generically; as is clear from what has been said before (50, 4; 55, 1, ad 3). Hence, it follows that one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> would not have a particular <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of another, but only a general <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. In like manner it cannot be said that one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> another by the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; because that whereby the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands is something within the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; whereas the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> alone can penetrate the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. Again, it cannot be said that one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the other by a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; because that <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> would not differ from the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> understood, since each is immaterial. Therefore in no way does it appear that one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can understand another.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, if one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> did understand another, this would be either by an innate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; and so it would follow that, if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> were now to create another <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, such an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> could not be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; or else he would have to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> drawn from things; and so it would follow that the higher <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> could not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the lower, from whom they receive nothing. Therefore in no way does it seem that one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> another.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> We read in De Causis that "every <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the things which are not corrupted."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. lit. ii), such things as pre-existed from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, came forth from Him in two ways: first, into the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> mind; and secondly, so as to subsist in their own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>. They proceeded into the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> mind in such a way, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> impressed upon the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> mind the images of the things which He produced in their own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> being. Now in the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> not only the forms of corporeal things, but likewise the forms of all <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> creatures. So in every one of these <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> creatures, the forms of all things, both corporeal and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, were impressed by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>; yet so that in every <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> there was impressed the form of his own <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> according to both its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and its intelligible <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, so that he should subsist in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of his <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and understand himself by it; while the forms of other <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and corporeal natures were impressed in him only according to their intelligible <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, so that by such impressed <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> he might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> corporeal and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> creatures.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> natures of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are distinguished from one another in a certain order, as was already observed (50, 4, ad 1,2). So the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> does not hinder him from <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the other <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, since both the higher and lower bear affinity to his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the only difference being according to their various degrees of perfection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and effect does not lead one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> another, except on account of likeness, so far as <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and effect are alike. Therefore if likeness without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> be admitted in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, this will suffice for one to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> One <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> another by the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of such <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which differs from the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> whose image it is, not according to material and immaterial <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and intentional <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is himself a subsisting form in his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> being; but his <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of another <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is not so, for there it possesses only an intelligible <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. As the form of color on the wall has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; but, in the deferent medium, it has only intentional <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made every creature proportionate to the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> which He determined to make. Therefore had <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> resolved to make more <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> or more natures of things, He would have impressed more intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> minds; as a builder who, if he had intended to build a larger house, would have made larger foundations. Hence, for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to add a new creature to the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, means that He would add a new intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> to an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether an angle knows God by his own natural principles?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> principles. For <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. i) that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "by His incomprehensible might is placed above all heavenly minds." Afterwards he adds that, "since He is above all <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, He is remote from all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> above the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. But what is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> beyond cannot be reached. Therefore it appears that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> principles.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>): "We see now through a glass in a dark manner; but then face to face." From this it appears that there is a twofold <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the one, whereby He is seen in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, according to which He is said to be seen face to face; the other whereby He is seen in the mirror of creatures. As was already shown (12, 4), an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> cannot have the former <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> principles. Nor does vision through a mirror belong to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, since they do not derive their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from sensible things, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> observes (Div. Nom. vii). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are mightier in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> than men. Yet men can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> principles; according to <a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse19">Romans 1:19</a>: "what is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is manifest in them." Therefore much more so can the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> can have some <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by their own principles. In evidence whereof it must be borne in mind that a thing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in three ways: first, by the presence of its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> in the knower, as light can be seen in the eye; and so we have said that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> himself--secondly, by the presence of its similitude in the power which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it, as a stone is seen by the eye from its image being in the eye--thirdly, when the image of the object <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> is not drawn directly from the object itself, but from something else in which it is made to appear, as when we behold a man in a mirror.

<p>To the first-named class that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is likened by which He is seen through His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> such as this cannot accrue to any creature from its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> principles, as was said above (Question 12, Article 4). The third class comprises the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> whereby we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> while we are on earth, by His likeness reflected in creatures, according to <a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse20">Romans 1:20</a>: "The invisible things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made." Hence, too, we are said to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a mirror. But the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, whereby according to his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> principles the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, stands midway between these two; and is likened to that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> whereby a thing is seen through the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> abstracted from it. For since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> image is impressed on the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in as much as he is the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Yet he does not behold <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; because no <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> likeness is sufficient to represent the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Such <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> then approaches rather to the specular kind; because the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is itself a kind of mirror representing the Divine image.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> is speaking of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of comprehension, as his words expressly state. In this way <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by any created <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Since an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> remote from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it follows that he cannot comprehend Him; nor can he see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> through his own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Yet it does not follow on that account that he can have no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Him at all: because, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> remote from the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, so the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has of Himself is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> above the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> has of Him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> has of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is midway between these two kinds of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; nevertheless it approaches more to one of them, as was said above.
