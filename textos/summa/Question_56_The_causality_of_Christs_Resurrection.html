<h1>Question 56. The causality of Christ's Resurrection</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/4056.htm#article1"> Is Christ's Resurrection the cause of our resurrection?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4056.htm#article2"> Is it the cause of our justification?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether Christ's Resurrection is the cause of the resurrection of our bodies?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's Resurrection</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of our bodies</a>, because, given a sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, the effect must follow of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. If, then, <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's Resurrection</a> be the sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of our bodies</a>, then all the dead should have risen again as soon as He rose.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the dead</a>, so that the body may be rewarded or punished together with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, since they shared in <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> or <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccles. Hier. vii) and <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. iv). But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> must <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> be accomplished, even if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had not risen. Therefore the dead would rise again even though <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not. Consequently <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's Resurrection</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of our bodies</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's Resurrection</a> be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of our bodies</a>, it would be either the exemplar, or the efficient, or the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Now it is not the exemplar <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; because it is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who will bring about the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of our bodies</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse21">John 5:21</a>: "The Father raiseth up the dead": and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has no need to look at any exemplar <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> outside Himself. In like manner it is not the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; because an efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> acts only through contact, whether <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> or corporeal. Now it is evident that <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's Resurrection</a> has no corporeal contact with the dead who shall rise again, owing to distance of time and place; and similarly it has no <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> contact, which is through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, because even unbelievers and sinners shall rise again. Nor again is it the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, because when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> rose He was no longer a wayfarer, and consequently not in a state of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. Therefore, <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's Resurrection</a> does not appear to be in any way the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of ours.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, since death is the privation of life, then to destroy death seems to be nothing else than to bring life back again; and this is resurrection. But "by dying, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> destroyed our death" [Preface of Mass in Paschal <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">Time</a>]. Consequently, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death, not <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">His Resurrection</a>, is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">our resurrection</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> on <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 15:12</a>: "Now if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> be preached, that He rose again from the dead," the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "Who is the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">our resurrection</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated in 2 Metaphysics, text 4: "Whatever is first in any order, is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all that come after it." But <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's Resurrection</a> was the first in the order of <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">our resurrection</a>, as is evident from what was said above (Question 53, Article 3). Hence <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's Resurrection</a> must be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of ours: and this is what the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse20">1 Corinthians 15:20-21</a>): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is risen from the dead, the first-fruits of them that sleep; for by a man came death, and by a man the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the dead</a>."

<p>And this is reasonable. Because the principle of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life-giving is the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, of whom it is said (<a href="../bible/psa035.htm#verse10">Psalm 35:10</a>): "With Thee is the fountain of life": hence He Himself says (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse21">John 5:21</a>): "As the Father raiseth up the dead, and giveth life; so the Son also giveth life to whom He will." Now the divinely established <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order is that every <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> operates first upon what is nearest to it, and through it upon others which are more remote; just as fire first heats the nearest air, and through it it heats bodies that are further off: and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself first enlightens those <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> which are closer to Him, and through them others that are more remote, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. xiii). Consequently, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> first bestows <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> life upon that body which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> united with Himself, and through it works the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> in all other bodies.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As was stated above, <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's Resurrection</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of ours through the power of the united Word, who operates according to His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. And consequently, it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the effect to follow at once, but according as the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> disposes, namely, that first of all we be conformed to the suffering and dying <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in this suffering and mortal life; and afterwards may come to share in the likeness of <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">His Resurrection</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">our resurrection</a>, whereas <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's Resurrection</a> is the secondary, and as it were the instrumental <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But although the power of the principal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is not restricted to one instrument determinately, nevertheless since it works through this instrument, such instrument <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the effect. So, then, the Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> in itself is not tied down to <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's Resurrection</a> as a means of bringing about <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">our resurrection</a>: because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> could deliver us in some other way than through <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> and <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, as already stated (46, 2). But having once decreed to deliver us in this way, it is evident that <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's Resurrection</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of ours.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Properly speaking, <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's Resurrection</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but the efficient and exemplar <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">our resurrection</a>. It is the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> humanity, according to which He rose again, is as it were the instrument of His Godhead, and works by Its power, as stated above (13, 2,3). And therefore, just as all other things which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did and endured in His humanity are profitable to our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> through the power of the Godhead, as already stated (48, 6), so also is <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's Resurrection</a> the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of ours, through the Divine power whose office it is to quicken the dead; and this power by its presence is in touch with all places and times; and such virtual contact suffices for its efficiency. And since, as was stated above (ad 2), the primary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">human resurrection</a> is the Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, from which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has "the power of passing judgment, because He is the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>" (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse27">John 5:27</a>); the efficient power of <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">His Resurrection</a> extends to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> alike, who are subject to His judgment.

<p>But just as the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection of Christ's body</a>, through its personal union with the Word, is first in point of time, so also is it first in dignity and perfection; as the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says on <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse20">1 Corinthians 15:20-23</a>. But whatever is most perfect is always the exemplar, which the less perfect copies according to its mode; consequently <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's Resurrection</a> is the exemplar of ours. And this is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, not on the part of Him who rose again, who needs no exemplar, but on the part of them who are raised up, who must be likened to <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">that Resurrection</a>, according to <a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse21">Philippians 3:21</a>: "He will reform the body of our lowness, made like to the body of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>." Now although the efficiency of <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's Resurrection</a> extends to the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> alike, still its exemplarity extends properly only to the just, who are made conformable with His Sonship, according to <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse29">Romans 8:29</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Considered on the part of their efficiency, which is dependent on the Divine power, both <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death and <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">His Resurrection</a> are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> both of the destruction of death and of the renewal of life: but considered as exemplar <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death--by which He withdrew from mortal life--is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the destruction of our death; while <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">His Resurrection</a>, whereby He inaugurated <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> life, is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the repairing of our life. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> is furthermore a <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as stated above (Question 48, Article 1).

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether Christ's Resurrection is the cause of the resurrection of souls?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's Resurrection</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">resurrection of souls</a>, because <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. xxiii super Joan.) that "bodies rise by His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> dispensation, but <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> rise by the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">Substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." But <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's Resurrection</a> does not belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">Substance</a>, but to the dispensation of His humanity. Therefore, although <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's Resurrection</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">bodies rising</a>, nevertheless it does not seem to be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">resurrection of souls</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a body does not act upon a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> belongs to His body, which death laid low. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">His Resurrection</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">resurrection of souls</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, since <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's Resurrection</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> why bodies rise again, the bodies of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> shall rise again, according to <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse51">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>: "We shall all indeed rise again." But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of all will not rise again, because according to <a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse46">Matthew 25:46</a>: "some shall go into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting punishment</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's Resurrection</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">resurrection of souls</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">resurrection of souls</a> comes of the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But this was effected by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rev001.htm#verse5">Apocalypse 1:5</a>: "He washed us from our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in His own blood." Consequently, <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> even more than His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">resurrection of souls</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse25">Romans 4:25</a>): "He rose again for our <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>," which is nothing else than the <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">resurrection of souls</a>: and on <a href="../bible/psa029.htm#verse6">Psalm 29:6</a>: "In the evening weeping shall have place," the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says, "<a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's Resurrection</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of ours, both of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> at present, and of the body in the future."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above, <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's Resurrection</a> works in virtue of the Godhead; now this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> extends not only to the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of bodies</a>, but also to that of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>: for it comes of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> lives by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and that the body lives by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Consequently, <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's Resurrection</a> has instrumentally an effective power not only with regard to the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of bodies</a>, but also with respect to the <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">resurrection of souls</a>. In like fashion it is an exemplar <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> with regard to the <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">resurrection of souls</a>, because even in our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> we must be conformed with the rising Christ: as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse4">Romans 6:4-11</a>) "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is risen from the dead by the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Father, so we also may walk in newness of life": and as He, "rising again from the dead, dieth now no more, so let us reckon that we (<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'you')" are dead to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that we may "live together with Him."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says that the <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">resurrection of souls</a> is wrought by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">Substance</a>, as to participation, because <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> become <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and just by sharing in the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, but not by sharing in anything <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>. Accordingly, after saying that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> rise by the Divine Substance, he adds: the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is beatified by a participation with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not by a participation with a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But our bodies are made <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> by sharing in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The efficacy of <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's Resurrection</a> reaches <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> not from any special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of His risen body, but from the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the Godhead personally united with it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">resurrection of souls</a> pertains to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, which is the effect of <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>; but the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of bodies</a> is ordained for punishment or reward, which are the effects of Him who judges. Now it belongs to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, not to justify all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but to judge them: and therefore He raises up all as to their bodies, but not as to their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Two things concur in the justification of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, namely, forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and newness of life through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Consequently, as to efficacy, which comes of the Divine power, the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> as well as the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of justification as to both the above. But as to exemplarity, properly speaking <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> and death are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the forgiveness of guilt, by which forgiveness we die unto <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: whereas <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's Resurrection</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of newness of life, which comes through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> or <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: consequently, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse25">Romans 4:25</a>) that "He was delivered up," i.e. to death, "for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>," i.e. to take them away, "and rose again for our <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> was also a <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as stated above (1, ad 4; 48, 1).
