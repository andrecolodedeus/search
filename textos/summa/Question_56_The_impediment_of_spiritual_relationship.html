<h1>Question 56. The impediment of spiritual relationship</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5056.htm#article1"> Is spiritual relationship an impediment to marriage?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5056.htm#article2"> From what cause is it contracted?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5056.htm#article3"> Between whom?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5056.htm#article4"> Does it pass from husband to wife?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5056.htm#article5"> Does it pass to the father's carnal children?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether spiritual relationship is an impediment to marriage?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship is not an impediment to marriage. For nothing is an impediment to marriage save what is contrary to a marriage <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship is not contrary to a marriage <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore it is not an impediment to marriage.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a perpetual impediment to marriage cannot stand together with marriage. But <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship sometimes stands together with marriage, as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 42), as when a man in a case of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> baptizes his own child, for then he contracts a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship with his wife, and yet the marriage is not dissolved. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship is not an impediment to marriage.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, union of the spirit does not pass to the flesh. But marriage is a union of the flesh. Therefore since <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship is a union of the spirit, it cannot become an impediment to marriage.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, contraries have not the same effects. Now <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship is apparently contrary to <a href="../cathen/05037b.htm">disparity of worship</a>, since <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship is a kinship resulting from the giving of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> or the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of so doing [See next Article, ad 3: whereas <a href="../cathen/05037b.htm">disparity of worship</a> consists in the lack of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as stated above (Question 50, Article 1). Since then <a href="../cathen/05037b.htm">disparity of worship</a> is an impediment to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>, it would seem that <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship has not this effect.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holier</a> the bond, the more is it to be safeguarded. Now a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> bond is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holier</a> than a bodily tie: and since the tie of bodily kinship is an impediment to marriage, it follows that <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship should also be an impediment.

<p>Further, in marriage the union of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> ranks higher than union of bodies, for it precedes it. Therefore with much more reason can a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship hinder marriage than bodily relationship does.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Just as by carnal procreation <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> receives <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> being, so by the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> he receives the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> being of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Wherefore just as the tie that is contracted by carnal procreation is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, inasmuch as he is a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> being, so the tie that is contracted from the reception of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> is after a fashion <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, inasmuch as he is a member of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Therefore as carnal relationship hinders marriage, even so does <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship by command of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. We must however draw a distinction in reference to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship, since either it precedes or follows marriage. If it precedes, it hinders the contracting of marriage and voids the contract. If it follows, it does not dissolve the marriage bond: but we must draw a further distinction in reference to the marriage act. For either the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship is contracted in a case of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, as when a father baptizes his child who is at the point of death--and then it is not an obstacle to the marriage act on either side--or it is contracted without any <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> and through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, in which case if the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> whose action has occasioned the relationship acted with due caution, it is the same with him as in the former case--or it is contracted purposely and without any <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, and then the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> whose action has occasioned the relationship, loses the right to ask for the debt; but is bound to pay if asked, because the fault of the one party should not be prejudicial to the other.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship does not hinder any of the chief marriage goods, it hinders one of the secondary goods, namely the extension of friendship, because <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship is by itself a sufficient reason for friendship: wherefore intimacy and friendship with other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> need to be sought by means of marriage.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Marriage is a lasting bond, wherefore no supervening impediment can sever it. Hence it happens sometimes that marriage and an impediment to marriage stand together, but not if the impediment precedes.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In marriage there is not only a bodily but also a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> union: and consequently kinship of spirit proves an impediment thereto, without <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> kinship having to pass into a bodily relationship.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> There is nothing unreasonable in two things that are contrary to one another being contrary to the same thing, as great and small are contrary to equal. Thus <a href="../cathen/05037b.htm">disparity of worship</a> and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship are opposed to marriage, because in one the distance is greater, and in the other less, than required by marriage. Hence there is an impediment to marriage in either case.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether spiritual relationship is contracted by baptism only?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship is contracted by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> only. For as bodily kinship is to bodily birth, so is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> kinship to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> birth. Now <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> alone is called <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> birth. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> kinship is contracted by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> only, even as only by carnal birth is carnal kinship contracted.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a character is imprinted in order as in Confirmation. But <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship does not result from receiving orders. Therefore it does not result from Confirmation but only from <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are more excellent than <a href="../cathen/13292d.htm">sacramentals</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship does not result from certain <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, for instance from <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a>. Much less therefore does it result from catechizing, as some maintain.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, many other <a href="../cathen/13292d.htm">sacramentals</a> are attached to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> besides catechizing. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship is not contracted from catechism any more than from the others.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is no less efficacious than instruction of catechism for advancement in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship does not result from <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Therefore it does not result from catechism.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, the instruction given to the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by preaching to them avails no less than preaching to those who are not yet <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. But no <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship results from preaching. Neither therefore does it result from catechism.

<p><strong>Objection 7.</strong> On the other hand, It is written (<a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse15">1 Corinthians 4:15</a>): "In <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a> by the gospel I have begotten you." Now <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> birth <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship results from the preaching of the gospel and instruction, and not only from <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 8.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is taken away by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, so is actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> taken away by Penance. Therefore just as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship, so also does Penance.

<p><strong>Objection 9.</strong> Further, "father" denotes relationship. Now a man is called another's <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> father in respect of Penance, teaching, pastoral care and many other like things. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship is contracted from many other sources besides <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> and Confirmation.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There are three opinions on this question. Some say that as <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> regeneration is bestowed by the sevenfold <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by means of seven things, beginning with the first taste of blessed salt and ending with Confirmation given by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>: and they say that <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship is contracted by each of these seven things. But this does not seem reasonable, for carnal relationship is not contracted except by a perfect act of generation. Wherefore affinity is not contracted except there be mingling of seeds, from which it is possible for carnal generation to follow. Now <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> generation is not perfected except by a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>: wherefore it does not seem fitting for <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship to be contracted otherwise than through a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Hence others say that <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship is only contracted through three <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, namely catechism, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> and Confirmation, but these do not apparently <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the meaning of what they say, since catechism is not a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> but a sacramental. Wherefore others say that it is contracted through two <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> only, namely Confirmation and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, and this is the more common opinion. Some however of these say that catechism is a weak impediment, since it hinders the contracting of marriage but does not void the contract.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Carnal birth is twofold. The first is in the womb, wherein that which is born is a weakling and cannot come forth without danger: and to this birth regeneration by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is likened; wherein a man is regenerated as though yet needing to be fostered in the womb of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The second is birth from out of the womb, when that which was born in the womb is so far strengthened that it can without danger face the outer world which has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> corruptive tendency. To this is likened Confirmation, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> being strengthened goes forth abroad to confess the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship is fittingly contracted through both these <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The effect of the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacrament of order</a> is not regeneration but the bestowal of power, for which reason it is not conferred on <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and consequently no impediment to marriage can arise therefrom. Hence this kind of relationship does not count.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In catechism one makes a profession of future <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, just as in <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothal</a> one enters an engagement of future marriage. Wherefore just as in <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothal</a> a certain kind of propinquity is contracted, so is there in catechism, whereby marriage is rendered at least unlawful, as some say; but not in the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> There is not made a profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the other <a href="../cathen/13292d.htm">sacramentals</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, as in catechism: wherefore the comparison fails. The same answer applies to the Fifth and Sixth Objections.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 7.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> had instructed them in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by a kind of catechism; and consequently his instruction was directed to their <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> birth.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 8.</strong> Properly speaking a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship is not contracted through the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a>. Wherefore a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> son can marry a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> whose confession the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> has heard, else in the whole <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> he could not find a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> whom he could marry. Nor does it matter that by Penance actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is taken away, for this is not a kind of birth, but a kind of healing. Nevertheless Penance occasions a kind of bond between the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> penitent and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, that has a resemblance to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship, so that if he have carnal intercourse with her, he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> as grievously as if she were his <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> daughter. The reason of this is that the relations between <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and penitent are most intimate, and consequently in order to remove the occasion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> this prohibition [Can. Omnes quos, and seqq., Caus. xxx] was made.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 9.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> father is so called from his likeness to a carnal father. Now as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. viii, 2) a carnal father gives his child three things, being nourishment and instruction: and consequently a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> father is so called from one of these three things. Nevertheless he has not, through being his <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> father, a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship with him, unless he is like a (carnal) father as to generation which is the way to being. This solution may also be applied to the foregoing Eighth Objection.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether spiritual relationship is contracted between the person baptized and the person who raises him from the sacred font?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship is not contracted between the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who raises him from the sacred font. For in carnal generation carnal relationship is contracted only on the part of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of whose seed the child is born; and not on the part of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who receives the child after birth. Therefore neither is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship contracted between the receiver and the received at the sacred font.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, he who raises a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> from the sacred font is called <em>anadochos</em> by <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Eccl. Hier. ii): and it is part of his office to instruct the child. But instruction is not a sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Therefore no relationship is contracted between him and the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> whom he raises from the sacred font.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it may happen that someone raises a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> from the sacred font before he himself is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship is not contracted in such a case, since one who is not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> is not capable of spirituality. Therefore raising a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> from the sacred font is not sufficient to contract a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> There is the definition of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship quoted above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), as also the authorities mentioned in the text (Sent. iv, D, 42).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Just as in carnal generation a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is born of a father and mother, so in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> generation a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is born again a son of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as Father, and of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as Mother. Now while he who confers the sacrament stands in the place of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose instrument and minister he is, he who raises a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> from the sacred font, or holds the candidate for Confirmation, stands in the place of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship is contracted with both.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Not only the father, of whose seed the child is born, is related carnally to the child, but also the mother who provides the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and in whose womb the child is begotten. So too the godparent who in place of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> offers and raises the candidate for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> and holds the candidate for Confirmation contracts <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> He contracts <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship not by reason of the instruction it is his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to give, but on account of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> birth in which he co-operates.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who is not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> cannot raise anyone from the sacred font, since he is not a member of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> whom the godparent in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> represents: although he can <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, because he is a creature of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Whom the baptizer represents. And yet he cannot contract a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship, since he is void of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life to which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is first born by receiving <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether spiritual relationship passes from husband to wife?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship does not pass from husband to wife. For <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and bodily union are disparate and differ generically. Therefore carnal union which is between husband and wife cannot be the means of contracting a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the godfather and godmother have more in common in the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> birth that is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship, than a husband, who is godfather, has with his wife. Now godfather and godmother do not hereby contract <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship. Therefore neither does a wife contract a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship through her husband being godfather to someone.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it may happen that the husband is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and his wife not, for instance when he is converted from unbelief without his wife being <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship cannot be contracted by one who is not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. Therefore it does not always pass from husband to wife.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, husband and wife together can raise a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> from the sacred font, since no <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> forbids it. If therefore <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship passed from husband to wife, it would follow that each of them is twice godfather or godmother of the same <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>: which is absurd.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Spiritual goods are more communicable than bodily goods. But the bodily <a href="../cathen/04264a.htm">consanguinity</a> of the husband passes to his wife by affinity. Much more therefore does <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A may become co-parent with B in two ways. First, by the act of another (B), who baptizes A's child, or raises him in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. In this way <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship does not pass from husband to wife, unless perchance it be his wife's child, for then she contracts <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship directly, even as her husband. Secondly, by his own act, for instance when he raises B's child from the sacred font, and thus <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship passes to the wife if he has already had carnal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of her, but not if the marriage be not yet consummated, since they are not as yet made one flesh: and this is by way of a kind of affinity; wherefore it would seem on the same grounds to pass to a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of whom he has carnal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, though she be not his wife. Hence the verse: "I may not marry my own child's godmother, nor the mother of my godchild: but I may marry the godmother of my wife's child."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> From the fact that corporal and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> union differ generically we may conclude that the one is not the other, but not that the one cannot <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the other, since things of different genera sometimes <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> one another either directly or indirectly.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The godfather and godmother of the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> are not united in that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> birth save <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, since one of them would be self-sufficient for the purpose. Hence it does not follow from this that any <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship results between them whereby they are hindered from marrying one another. Hence the verse: <blockquote> "Of two co-parents one is always <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, the other carnal: this rule is <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a>." </blockquote>

<p>On the other hand, marriage by itself makes husband and wife one flesh: wherefore the comparison fails.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If the wife be not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship will not reach her, because she is not a fit subject, and not because <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship cannot pass from husband to wife through marriage.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Since no <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship results between godfather and godmother, nothing prevents husband and wife from raising together someone from the sacred font. Nor is it absurd that the wife become twice godmother of the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> from different <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, just as it is possible for her to be connected in carnal relationship both by affinity and <a href="../cathen/04264a.htm">consanguinity</a> to the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether spiritual relationship passes to the godfather's carnal children?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship does not pass to the godfather's carnal children. For no degrees are assigned to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship. Yet there would be degrees if it passed from father to son, since the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> begotten involves a change of degree, as stated above (Question 55, Article 5). Therefore it does not pass to the godfather's carnal sons.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, father and son are related in the same degree as brother and brother. If therefore <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship passes from father to son, it will equally pass from brother to brother: and this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> This is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by authority quoted in the text (Sent. iv, D, 42).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A son is something of his father and not conversely (Ethic. viii, 12): wherefore <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship passes from father to his carnal son and not conversely. Thus it is clear that there are three <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationships: one called <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> fatherhood between godfather and godchild; another called co-paternity between the godparent and carnal parent of the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; and the third is called <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> brotherhood, between godchild and the carnal children of the same parent. Each of these hinders the contracting of marriage and voids the contract.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The addition of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> by carnal generation entails a degree with regard to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> connected by the same kind of relationship, but not with regard to one connected by another kind of relationship. Thus a son is connected with his father's wife in the same degree as his father, but by another kind of relationship. Now <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship differs in kind from carnal. Wherefore a godson is not related to his godfather's carnal son in the same degree as the latter's father is related to him, through whom the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship is contracted. Consequently it does not follow that <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship admits of degrees.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not part of his brother as a son is of his father. But a wife is part of her husband, since she is made one with him in body. Consequently the relationship does not pass from brother to brother, whether the brother be born before or after <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> brotherhood.
