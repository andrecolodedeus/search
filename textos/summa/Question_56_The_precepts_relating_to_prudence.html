<h1>Question 56. The precepts relating to prudence</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3056.htm#article1"> The precepts of prudence</a> <li><a href="../summa/3056.htm#article2"> The precepts relating to the opposite vices</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the precepts of the decalogue should have included a precept of prudence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> should have included a precept of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. For the chief precepts should include a precept of the chief <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now the chief precepts are those of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>. Since then <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is the chief of the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, it seems that the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> should have included a precept of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the teaching of the Gospel contains the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> especially with regard to the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>. Now the teaching of the Gospel contains a precept of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse16">Matthew 10:16</a>): "Be ye . . . <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'wise'] as serpents." Therefore the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> should have included a precept of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the other lessons of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> are directed to the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/mal004.htm#verse4">Malachi 4:4</a>): "Remember the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> My servant, which I commanded him in Horeb." Now the other lessons of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> include precepts of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>; for instance (<a href="../bible/pro003.htm#verse5">Proverbs 3:5</a>): "Lean not upon thy own <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>"; and further on (<a href="../bible/pro004.htm#verse25">Proverbs 4:25</a>): "Let thine eyelids go before thy steps." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> also should have contained a precept of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, especially among the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>.

<p>The contrary however appears to anyone who goes through the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (I-II, 100, 3; 5, ad 1) when we were treating of precepts, the commandments of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> being given to the whole people, are a matter of common <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to all, as coming under the purview of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Now foremost among the things dictated by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> are the ends of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, which are to the practical order what <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> principles are to the speculative order, as shown above (Question 47, Article 6). Now <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is not about the end, but about the means, as stated above (Question 47, Article 6). Hence it was not fitting that the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> should include a precept relating directly to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. And yet all the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> are related to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, in so far as it directs all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> acts.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is simply foremost among all the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, yet <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, more than any other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, regards its object under the aspect of something due, which is a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> for a precept, as stated above (44, 1; I-II, 99, 1,5). Hence it behooved the chief precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, which are those of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>, to refer to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> rather than to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The teaching of the Gospel is the doctrine of perfection. Therefore it needed to instruct <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> perfectly in all matters relating to right conduct, whether ends or means: wherefore it behooved the Gospel teaching to contain precepts also of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Just as the rest of the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> is directed to the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> as its end, so it behooved <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be instructed by the subsequent lessons of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> about the act of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> which is directed to the means.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the prohibitive precepts relating to the vices opposed to prudence are fittingly propounded in the Old Law?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the prohibitive precepts relating to the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> opposed to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> are unfittingly propounded in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. For such <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> as imprudence and its parts which are directly opposed to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> are not less opposed thereto, than those which bear a certain resemblance to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, such as craftiness and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> connected with it. Now the latter <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are forbidden in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>: for it is written (<a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse13">Leviticus 19:13</a>): "Thou shalt not calumniate thy neighbor," and (<a href="../bible/deu025.htm#verse13">Deuteronomy 25:13</a>): "Thou shalt not have divers weights in thy bag, a greater and a less." Therefore there should have also been prohibitive precepts about the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> directly opposed to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, there is room for <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> in other things than in buying and selling. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> unfittingly forbade <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> solely in buying and selling.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, there is the same reason for prescribing an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> as for prohibiting the act of a contrary <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. But acts of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> are not prescribed in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. Therefore neither should any contrary <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> have been forbidden in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>.

<p>The contrary, however, appears from the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> which are quoted in the first objection.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, above all, regards the aspect of something due, which is a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> for a precept, because <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> tends to render that which is due to another, as we shall state further on (58, 2). Now craftiness, as to its execution, is committed chiefly in matters of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as stated above (Question 55, Article 8): and so it was fitting that the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> should contain precepts forbidding the execution of craftiness, in so far as this pertains to <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, as when a man uses guile and <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> in calumniating another or in stealing his goods.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Those <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> that are manifestly opposed to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, do not pertain to <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> in the same way as the execution of craftiness, and so they are not forbidden in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, as <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> and guile are, which latter pertain to <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> All guile and <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> committed in matters of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, can be understood to be forbidden in the prohibition of <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> (<a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse13">Leviticus 19:13</a>). Yet <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> and guile are wont to be practiced chiefly in buying and selling, according to <a href="../bible/sir026.htm#verse28">Sirach 26:28</a>, "A huckster shall not be justified from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the lips": and it is for this reason that the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> contained a special precept forbidding fraudulent buying and selling.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> All the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> that relate to acts of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> pertain to the execution of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, even as the precepts prohibitive of stealing, <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> and fraudulent selling pertain to the execution of craftiness.
