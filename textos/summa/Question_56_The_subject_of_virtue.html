<h1>Question 56. The subject of virtue</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2056.htm#article1"> Is the subject of virtue a power of the soul?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2056.htm#article2"> Can one virtue be in several powers?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2056.htm#article3"> Can the intellect be the subject of virtue?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2056.htm#article4"> Can the irascible and concupiscible faculties be the subject of virtue?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2056.htm#article5"> Can the sensitive powers of apprehension can be the subject of virtue?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2056.htm#article6"> Can the will be the subject of virtue?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the subject of virtue is a power of the soul?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the subject of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not a power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Lib. Arb. ii, 19) that "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is that by which we live righteously." But we live by the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and not by a power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not a power, but in the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 6) that "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is that which makes its possessor <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and his work <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> likewise." But as work is set up by power, so he that has a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is set up by the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> does not belong to the power, any more than to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, power is in the second <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>. But <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, as we have said above (Question 55, Article 4): and <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> is not the subject of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>. Therefore a power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not the subject of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> "Virtue is the limit of power" (De Coelo ii). But the limit is in that of which it is the limit. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is in a power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in three ways that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> belongs to a power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. First, from the notion of the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which implies perfection of a power; for perfection is in that which it perfects. Secondly, from the fact that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is an operative <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, as we have said above (Question 55, Article 2): for all operation proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> through a power. Thirdly, from the fact that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> disposes to that which is best: for the best is the end, which is either a thing's operation, or something acquired by an operation proceeding from the thing's power. Therefore a power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the subject of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> "To live" may be taken in two ways. Sometimes it is taken for the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of the living thing: in this way it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is the principle of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in the living thing. But sometimes "to live" is taken for the operation of the living thing: in this sense, by <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> we live righteously, inasmuch as by <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> we perform righteous actions.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Good is either the end, or something referred to the end. And therefore, since the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the worker consists in the work, this fact also, that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> makes the worker <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, is referred to the work, and consequently, to the power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> One <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> is said to be the subject of another, not as though one <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> could uphold another; but because one <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> inheres to <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> by means of another, as color to the body by means of the surface; so that surface is said to be the subject of color. In this way a power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is said to be the subject of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether one virtue can be in several powers?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> can be in several powers. For <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by their acts. But one act proceeds in various way from several powers: thus walking proceeds from the reason as directing, from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as moving, and from the motive power as executing. Therefore also one <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> can be in several powers.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 4) that three things are required for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, namely: "to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, to will, and to work steadfastly." But "to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>" belongs to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and "to will" belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> can be in several powers.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is in the reason since it is "the right reason of things to be done" (Ethic. vi, 5). And it is also in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: for it cannot <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> together with a perverse will (Ethic. vi, 12). Therefore one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> can be in two powers.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The subject of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But the same <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> cannot be in several subjects. Therefore one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> cannot be in several powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It happens in two ways that one thing is subjected in two. First, so that it is in both on an equal footing. In this way it is impossible for one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to be in two powers: since diversity of powers follows the generic <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of the objects, while diversity of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> follows the specific <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> thereof: and so wherever there is diversity of powers, there is diversity of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>; but not vice versa. In another way one thing can be subjected in two or more, not on an equal footing, but in a certain order. And thus one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> can belong to several powers, so that it is in one chiefly, while it extends to others by a kind of diffusion, or by way of a disposition, in so far as one power is moved by another, and one power receives from another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> One act cannot belong to several powers equally, and in the same degree; but only from different points of view, and in various degrees.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> "To <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>" is a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> required for moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, inasmuch as moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> works according to right reason. But moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">Prudence</a> is really subjected in reason: but it presupposes as its principle the rectitude of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as we shall see further on (3; 57, 4).

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the intellect can be the subject of virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not the subject of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Moribus Eccl. xv) that all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is love. But the subject of love is not the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power alone. Therefore no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is referred to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as is clear from what has been said above (Question 55, Article 3). Now <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is not the object of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, but of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power. Therefore the subject of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is that "which makes its possessor <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 6). But the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> which perfects the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> does not make its possessor <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: since a man is not said to be a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> on account of his science or his art. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not the subject of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The mind is chiefly called the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. But the subject of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, as is clear from the definition, above given, of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> (55, 4). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the subject of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As we have said above (Question 55, Article 3), a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> by which we work well. Now a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> may be directed to a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> act in two ways. First, in so far as by the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> a man acquires an aptness to a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> act; for instance, by the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of grammar <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has the aptness to speak correctly. But grammar does not make a man always speak correctly: for a grammarian may be guilty of a barbarism or make a solecism: and the case is the same with other <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> and arts. Secondly, a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> may confer not only aptness to act, but also the right use of that aptness: for instance, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> not only gives <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> the prompt will to do just actions, but also makes him act <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>.

<p>And since <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and, in like manner, being, is said of a thing simply, in respect, not of what it is <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a>, but of what it is actually: therefore from having <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of the latter sort, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is said simply to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; for instance, because he is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, or temperate; and in like manner as regards other such <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. And since <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is that "which makes its possessor <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and his work <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> likewise," these latter <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are called <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> simply: because they make the work to be actually <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and the subject <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> simply. But the first kind of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are not called <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> simply: because they do not make the work <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> except in regard to a certain aptness, nor do they make their possessor <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> simply. For through being gifted in science or art, a man is said to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, not simply, but relatively; for instance, a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> grammarian or a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> smith. And for this reason science and art are often divided against <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; while at other times they are called <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> (Ethic. vi, 2).

<p>Hence the subject of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> which is called a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in a relative sense, can be the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and not only the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, but also the speculative, without any reference to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: for thus the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vi, 3) holds that science, wisdom and understanding, and also art, are <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. But the subject of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> which is called a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> simply, can only be the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, or some power in so far as it is moved by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. And the reason of this is, that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> moves to their acts all those other powers that are in some way rational, as we have said above (9, 1; 17, A1,5; I, 82, 4): and therefore if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> do well actually, this is because he has a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which makes a man to do well actually, and not merely to have the aptness to do well, must be either in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> itself; or in some power as moved by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p>Now it happens that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is moved by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, just as are the other powers: for a man considers something actually, because he wills to do so. And therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, in so far as it is subordinate to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, can be the subject of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> absolutely so called. And in this way the speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, or the reason, is the subject of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is moved by the command of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to assent to what is of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: for "no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a>, unless he will" [<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>: Tract. xxvi in Joan.]. But the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the subject of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. For since <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is the right reason of things to be done, it is a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> thereof that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be rightly disposed in regard to the principles of this reason of things to be done, that is in regard to their ends, to which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is rightly disposed by the rectitude of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, just as to the principles of speculative <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> he is rightly disposed by the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> light of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. And therefore as the subject of science, which is the right reason of speculative <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, is the speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in its relation to the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, so the subject of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in its relation to the right will.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The saying of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is to be understood of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> simply so called: not that every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is love simply: but that it depends in some way on love, in so far as it depends on the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, whose first movement consists in love, as we have said above (25, A1,2,3; 27, 4; I, 20, 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of each thing is its end: and therefore, as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is the end of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, so to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Whence the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, which perfects the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in regard to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, whether speculative or practical, is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This objection considers <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> simply so called.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the irascible and concupiscible powers are the subject of virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> powers cannot be the subject of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For these powers are common to us and dumb animals. But we are now speaking of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> as proper to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, since for this reason it is called <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. It is therefore impossible for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to be in the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> powers which are parts of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, as we have said in the I, 81, 2.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is a power which makes use of a corporeal organ. But the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> cannot be in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> body: for the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm">Romans 7</a>): "I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> does not dwell in my flesh." Therefore the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> cannot be the subject of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> proves (De Moribus Eccl. v) that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not in the body but in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, for the reason that the body is ruled by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: wherefore it is entirely due to his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that a man make <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> use of his body: "For instance, if my coachman, through obedience to my orders, guides well the horses which he is driving; this is all due to me." But just as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> rules the body, so also does the reason rule the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Therefore that the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> powers are rightly ruled, is entirely due to the rational powers. Now "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is that by which we live rightly," as we have said above (Question 55, Article 4). Therefore <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not in the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> powers, but only in the rational powers.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, "the principal act of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is choice" (Ethic. viii, 13). Now choice is not an act of the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> powers, but of the rational power, as we have said above (Question 13, Article 2). Therefore moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not in the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> powers, but in the reason.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Fortitude is assigned to the irascible power, and <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> power. Whence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iii, 10) says that "these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> belong to the irrational part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> powers can be considered in two ways. First, in themselves, in so far as they are parts of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>: and in this way they are not competent to be the subject of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Secondly, they can be considered as participating in the reason, from the fact that they have a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> aptitude to obey reason. And thus the irascible or <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> power can be the subject of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: for, in so far as it participates in the reason, it is the principle of a <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a>. And to these powers we must needs assign <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p>For it is clear that there are some <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> powers. Because an act, which proceeds from one power according as it is moved by another power, cannot be perfect, unless both powers be well disposed to the act: for instance, the act of a craftsman cannot be successful unless both the craftsman and his instrument be well disposed to act. Therefore in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the operations of the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> powers, according as they are moved by reason, there must needs be some <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> perfecting in respect of acting well, not only the reason, but also the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> powers. And since the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> disposition of the power which moves through being moved, depends on its conformity with the power that moves it: therefore the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which is in the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> powers is nothing else but a certain <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> conformity of these powers to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> powers considered in themselves, as parts of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, are common to us and dumb animals. But in so far as they are rational by participation, and are obedient to the reason, they are proper to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. And in this way they can be the subject of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh has not of itself the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but is made the instrument of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> act, inasmuch as being moved by reason, we "yield our members to serve <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>"; so also, the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> powers, of themselves indeed, have not the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but rather the infection of the "fomes": whereas, inasmuch as they are in conformity with reason, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of reason is begotten in them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The body is ruled by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> powers by the reason, but in different ways. For the body obeys the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> blindly without any contradiction, in those things in which it has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> aptitude to be moved by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: whence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Polit. i, 3) that the "<a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> rules the body with a despotic command" as the master rules his <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a>: wherefore the entire movement of the body is referred to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For this reason <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not in the body, but in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> powers do not obey the reason blindly; on the contrary, they have their own proper movements, by which, at times, they go against reason, whence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Polit. i, 3) that the "reason rules the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> powers by a political command" such as that by which free men are ruled, who have in some respects a will of their own. And for this reason also must there be some <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> powers, by which these powers are well disposed to act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> In choice there are two things, namely, the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the end, and this belongs to the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and the preferential choice of that which is unto the end, and this belongs to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> (Ethic. vi, 2,5). But that the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> powers have a right <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the end in regard to the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, is due to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> disposition of these powers. And therefore those moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which are concerned with the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are in the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> powers, but <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is in the reason.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the sensitive powers of apprehension are the subject of virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is possible for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to be in the interior sensitive powers of apprehension. For the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> can be the subject of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, in so far as it obeys reason. But the interior sensitive powers of apprehension obey reason: for the powers of <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, of cogitation, and of <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> [Cf. I, 78, 4] act at the command of reason. Therefore in these powers there can be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as the rational <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, can be hindered or helped in its act, by the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, so also can the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> or reason be hindered or helped by the powers mentioned above. As, therefore, there can be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in the interior powers of <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, so also can there be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in the interior powers of apprehension.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, of which Cicero (De Invent. Rhetor. ii) says that <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> is a part. Therefore also in the power of <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> there can be a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: and in like manner, in the other interior sensitive powers of apprehension.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> All <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are either <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> or moral (Ethic. ii, 1). Now all the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; while the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> or reason, as is clear from Ethic. vi, 1. Therefore there is no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in the interior sensitive powers of apprehension.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In the interior sensitive powers of apprehension there are some <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>. And this is made clear principally from what the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Memoria ii), that "in remembering one thing after another, we become used to it; and use is a second <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." Now a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of use is nothing else than a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> acquired by use, which is like unto <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Wherefore Tully says of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in his Rhetoric that "it is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> like a second <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in accord with reason." Yet, in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that which he acquires by use, in his <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> and other sensitive powers of apprehension, is not a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> properly so called, but something annexed to the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> faculty, as we have said above (50, 4, ad 3).

<p>Nevertheless even if there be <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> in such powers, they cannot be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a perfect <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, by which it never happens that anything but <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is done: and so <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> must needs be in that power which consummates the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> act. But the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not consummated in the sensitive powers of apprehension: for such powers prepare the way to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. And therefore in these powers there are none of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, by which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: these are rather in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> or reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is related to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which is the rational <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, through being moved by it. And therefore the act of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power is consummated in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>: and for this reason the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is the subject of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Whereas the sensitive powers of apprehension are related to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> rather through moving it; for the reason that the phantasms are related to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as colors to sight (De Anima iii, text. 18). And therefore the act of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is terminated in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; and for this reason the cognoscitive <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> itself, or the reason.

<p>And thus is made clear the Reply to the Second Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">Memory</a> is not a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, as <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is of a genus, as though <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> were a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> properly so called: but one of the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> required for <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>; so that, in a fashion, it is after the manner of an integral part.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the will can be the subject of virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not the subject of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Because no <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is required for that which belongs to a power by reason of its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But since the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is in the reason, it is of the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Anima iii, text. 42), to tend to that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. And to this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is ordered, since everything <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> desires its own proper <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as Tully says in his Rhetoric, is a "<a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> like a second <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in accord with reason." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not the subject of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is either <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> or moral (Ethic. i, 13; ii, 1). But <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is subjected in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and reason, and not in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: while moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is subjected in the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> powers which are rational by participation. Therefore no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is subjected in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, all <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, to which <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are ordained, are <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. If therefore there be a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in respect of some <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, in like manner there will be a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in respect of all <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>. Either, therefore, there will be no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in any other power, or there will be two <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> ordained to the same act, which seems unreasonable. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> cannot be the subject of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Greater perfection is required in the mover than in the moved. But the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> moves the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> powers. Much more therefore should there be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> than in the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> powers.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> perfects the power in reference to act, then does the power need a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> perfecting it unto doing well, which <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, when the power's own proper <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> does not suffice for the purpose.

<p>Now the proper <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a power is seen in its relation to its object. Since, therefore, as we have said above (Question 19, Article 3), the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of reason proportionate to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, in respect of this the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does not need a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> perfecting it. But if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is confronted with a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that exceeds its capacity, whether as regards the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, such as Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which transcends the limits of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, or as regards the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, such as the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of one's neighbor, then does the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> need <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. And therefore such <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> as those which direct <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> affections to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or to his neighbor are subjected in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and such like.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This objection is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of those <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which are ordained to the willer's own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; such as <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, which are concerned with the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, and the like, as is clear from what we have said (35, 6).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Not only the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> powers are rational by participation but "the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power altogether," i.e. in its entirety (Ethic. i, 13). Now the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is included in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power. And therefore whatever <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> must be a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, unless it be theological, as we shall see later on (62, 3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Some <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are directed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of moderated passion, which is the proper <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of this or that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: and in these cases there is no need for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the power suffices for the purpose, as we have said. This need <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> only in the case of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which are directed to some extrinsic <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.
