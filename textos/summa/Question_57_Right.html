<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether right is the object of justice?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that right is not the object of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. For the jurist Celsus says [Digest. i, 1; De Just. et Jure 1 that "right is the art of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and equality." Now art is not the object of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but is by itself an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore right is not the object of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "Law," according to <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> (Etym. v, 3), "is a kind of right." Now <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is the object not of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> but of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> [Ethic. vi, 8 reckons "legislative" as one of the parts of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Therefore right is not the object of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, before all, subjects <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Moribus Eccl. xv) that "<a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is love serving <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, and consequently governing aright all things subject to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." Now right [jus] does not pertain to Divine things, but only to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, for <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. v, 2) that "'fas' is the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, and 'jus,' the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>." Therefore right is not the object of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. v, 2) that "'jus' [right] is so called because it is just." Now the "just" is the object of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> declares (Ethic. v, 1) that "all are agreed in giving the name of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> which makes men capable of doing just actions."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is proper to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as compared with the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, to direct <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in his relations with others: because it denotes a kind of equality, as its very name implies; indeed we are wont to say that things are adjusted when they are made equal, for equality is in reference of one thing to some other. On the other hand the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> perfect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in those matters only which befit him in relation to himself. Accordingly that which is right in the works of the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and to which the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> tends as to its proper object, depends on its relation to the agent only, whereas the right in a work of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, besides its relation to the agent, is set up by its relation to others. Because a man's work is said to be just when it is related to some other by way of some kind of equality, for instance the payment of the wage due for a service rendered. And so a thing is said to be <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, as having the rectitude of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, when it is the term of an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, without taking into account the way in which it is done by the agent: whereas in the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> nothing is declared to be right unless it is done in a certain way by the agent. For this reason <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> has its own special proper object over and above the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and this object is called the just, which is the same as "right." Hence it is evident that right is the object of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is usual for words to be distorted from their original signification so as to mean something else: thus the word "medicine" was first employed to signify a remedy used for curing a sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and then it was drawn to signify the art by which this is done. On like manner the word "jus" [right] was first of all used to denote the just thing itself, but afterwards it was transferred to designate the art whereby it is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> what is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, and further to denote the place where <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is administered, thus a man is said to appear "in jure" [In English we speak of a court of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, a barrister at <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, etc.], and yet further, we say even that a man, who has the office of exercising <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, administers the jus even if his sentence be <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as there pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the craftsman an expression of the things to be made externally by his craft, which expression is called the rule of his craft, so too there pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> an expression of the particular just work which the reason determines, and which is a kind of rule of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. If this rule be expressed in writing it is called a "<a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>," which according to <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> (Etym. v, 1) is "a written decree": and so <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is not the same as right, but an expression of right.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> implies equality, and since we cannot offer <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> an equal return, it follows that we cannot make Him a perfectly just repayment. For this reason the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> is not properly called "jus" but "fas," because, to wit, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is satisfied if we accomplish what we can. Nevertheless <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> tends to make <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> repay <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as much as he can, by subjecting his mind to Him entirely.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether right is fittingly divided into natural right and positive right?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that right is not fittingly divided into <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> right and positive right. For that which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> is unchangeable, and is the same for all. Now nothing of the kind is to be found in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, since all the rules of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> right fail in certain cases, nor do they obtain force everywhere. Therefore there is no such thing as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> right.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a thing is called "positive" when it proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will. But a thing is not <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, simply because it proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will, else a man's will could not be <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>. Since then the "just" and the "right" are the same, it seems that there is no positive right.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, Divine right is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> right, since it transcends <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. On like manner, neither is it positive right, since it is based not on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, but on Divine authority. Therefore right is unfittingly divided into <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and positive.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. v, 7) that "political <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is partly <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and partly legal," i.e. established by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>) the "right" or the "just" is a work that is adjusted to another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> according to some kind of equality. Now a thing can be adjusted to a man in two ways: first by its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as when a man gives so much that he may receive equal value in return, and this is called "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> right." On another way a thing is adjusted or commensurated to another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, by agreement, or by common consent, when, to wit, a man deems himself satisfied, if he receive so much. This can be done in two ways: first by private agreement, as that which is confirmed by an agreement between private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>; secondly, by public agreement, as when the whole community agrees that something should be deemed as though it were adjusted and commensurated to another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, or when this is decreed by the prince who is placed over the people, and acts in its stead, and this is called "positive right."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> That which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to one whose <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is unchangeable, must needs be such always and everywhere. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is changeable, wherefore that which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may sometimes fail. Thus the restitution of a deposit to the depositor is in accordance with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> equality, and if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> were always right, this would always have to be observed; but since it happens sometimes that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is unrighteous there are cases in which a deposit should not be restored, lest a man of unrighteous will make <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> use of the thing deposited: as when a madman or an enemy of the common weal demands the return of his weapons.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will can, by common agreement, make a thing to be just provided it be not, of itself, contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and it is in such matters that positive right has its place. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. v, 7) that "in the case of the legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, it does not <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in the first instance whether it takes one form or another, it only matters when once it is laid down." If, however, a thing is, of itself, contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> right, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will cannot make it <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, for instance by decreeing that it is lawful to steal or to commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/isa010.htm#verse1">Isaiah 10:1</a>): "Woe to them that make <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> laws."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The Divine right is that which is promulgated by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Such things are partly those that are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, yet their <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is hidden to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and partly are made just by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> decree. Hence also Divine right may be divided in respect of these two things, even as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> right is. For the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> commands certain things because they are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and forbids others, because they are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, while others are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> because they are prescribed, and others <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> because they are forbidden.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the right of nations is the same as the natural right?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the right of nations is the same as the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> right. For all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> do not agree save in that which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to them. Now all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> agree in the right of <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>; since the jurist [Ulpian: Digest. i, 1; De Just. et Jure i] "the right of nations is that which is in use among all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>." Therefore the right of nations is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> right.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, slavery among men is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, for some are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> slaves according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Polit. i, 2). Now "slavery belongs to the right of <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>," as <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> states (Etym. v, 4). Therefore the right of nations is a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> right.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, right as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>) is divided into <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and positive. Now the right of nations is not a positive right, since all nations never agreed to decree anything by common agreement. Therefore the right of nations is a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> right.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. v, 4) that "right is either <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, or civil, or right of <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>," and consequently the right of nations is distinct from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> right.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> right or just is that which by its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is adjusted to or commensurate with another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Now this may happen in two ways; first, according as it is considered absolutely: thus a male by its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is commensurate with the female to beget offspring by her, and a parent is commensurate with the offspring to nourish it. Secondly a thing is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> commensurate with another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, not according as it is considered absolutely, but according to something resultant from it, for instance the possession of property. For if a particular piece of land be considered absolutely, it contains no reason why it should belong to one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> more than to another, but if it be considered in respect of its adaptability to cultivation, and the unmolested use of the land, it has a certain commensuration to be the property of one and not of another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> shows (Polit. ii, 2).

<p>Now it belongs not only to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> but also to other animals to apprehend a thing absolutely: wherefore the right which we call <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, is common to us and other animals according to the first kind of commensuration. But the right of nations falls short of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> right in this sense, as the jurist [Digest. i, 1; De Just. et Jure i] says because "the latter is common to all animals, while the former is common to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> only." On the other hand to consider a thing by comparing it with what results from it, is proper to reason, wherefore this same is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in respect of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> which dictates it. Hence the jurist Gaius says (Digest. i, 1; De Just. et Jure i, 9): "whatever <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> decrees among all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, is observed by all equally, and is called the right of <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>." This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Considered absolutely, the fact that this particular <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> rather than another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, is based, not on <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, but on some resultant utility, in that it is useful to this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be ruled by a wiser <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and to the latter to be helped by the former, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Polit. i, 2). Wherefore slavery which belongs to the right of nations is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> in the second way, but not in the first.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> dictates matters which are according to the right of <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, as implying a proximate equality, it follows that they need no special institution, for they are instituted by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> itself, as stated by the authority quoted above

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether paternal right and right of dominion should be distinguished as special species?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that "paternal right" and "right of dominion" should not be distinguished as special <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. For it belongs to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to render to each one what is his, as <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> states (De Offic. i, 24). Now right is the object of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore right belongs to each one equally; and we ought not to distinguish the rights of fathers and masters as distinct <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is an expression of what is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, as stated above (1, ad 2). Now a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> looks to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of a city or kingdom, as stated above (I-II, 90, 2), but not to the private <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> or even of one household. Therefore there is no need for a special right of dominion or paternal right, since the master and the father pertain to a household, as stated in Polit. i, 2.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, there are many other differences of degrees among men, for instance some are soldiers, some are <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, some are princes. Therefore some special kind of right should be allotted to them.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. v, 6) distinguishes right of dominion, paternal right and so on as <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> distinct from civil right.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Right or just depends on commensuration with another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Now "another" has a twofold signification. First, it may denote something that is other simply, as that which is altogether distinct; as, for example, two men neither of whom is subject to the other, and both of whom are subjects of the ruler of the state; and between these according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. v, 6) there is the "just" simply. Secondly a thing is said to be other from something else, not simply, but as belonging in some way to that something else: and in this way, as regards <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, a son belongs to his father, since he is part of him somewhat, as stated in Ethic. viii, 12, and a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> belongs to his master, because he is his instrument, as stated in Polit. i, 2 [Cf. Ethic. viii, 11. Hence a father is not compared to his son as to another simply, and so between them there is not the just simply, but a kind of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, called "paternal." On like manner neither is there the just simply, between master and servant, but that which is called "dominative." A wife, though she is something belonging to the husband, since she stands related to him as to her own body, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> declares (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse28">Ephesians 5:28</a>), is nevertheless more distinct from her husband, than a son from his father, or a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> from his master: for she is received into a kind of social life, that of <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>, wherefore according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. v, 6) there is more scope for <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> between husband and wife than between father and son, or master and <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a>, because, as husband and wife have an immediate relation to the community of the household, as stated in Polit. i, 2,5, it follows that between them there is "domestic <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>" rather than "civic."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It belongs to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to render to each one his right, the distinction between <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> being presupposed: for if a man gives himself his due, this is not strictly called "just." And since what belongs to the son is his father's, and what belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> is his master's, it follows that properly speaking there is not <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of father to son, or of master to <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A son, as such, belongs to his father, and a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a>, as such, belongs to his master; yet each, considered as a man, is something having separate <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> and distinct from others. Hence in so far as each of them is a man, there is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> towards them in a way: and for this reason too there are certain laws regulating the relations of father to his son, and of a master to his <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a>; but in so far as each is something belonging to another, the perfect <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of "right" or "just" is wanting to them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> All other differences between one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and another in a state, have an immediate relation to the community of the state and to its ruler, wherefore there is just towards them in the perfect sense of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. This "just" however is distinguished according to various offices, hence when we speak of "military," or "magisterial," or "<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a>" right, it is not as though such rights fell short of the simply right, as when we speak of "paternal" right, or right of "dominion," but for the reason that something proper is due to each class of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in respect of his particular office.
