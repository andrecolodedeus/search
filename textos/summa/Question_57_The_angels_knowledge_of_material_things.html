<h1>Question 57. The angel's knowledge of material things</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1057.htm#article1"> Do the angels know the natures of material things?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1057.htm#article2"> Do they know single things?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1057.htm#article3"> Do they know the future?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1057.htm#article4"> Do they know secret thoughts?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1057.htm#article5"> Do they know all mysteries of grace?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the angels know material things?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> material things. For the object understood is the perfection of him who understands it. But material things cannot be the perfections of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, since they are beneath them. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> material things.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> vision is only of such things as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> within the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, as is said in the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> [On <a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse2">2 Corinthians 12:2</a>, taken from <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. xii. 28)]. But the material things cannot enter by their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> into <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, nor into the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> mind. Therefore they cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> vision, but only by <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision, whereby the images of bodies are apprehended, and by sensible vision, which regards bodies in themselves. Now there is neither <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> nor sensible vision in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but only <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> material things.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, material things are not actually intelligible, but are knowable by apprehension of sense and of <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, which does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> material things.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Whatever the lower power can do, the higher can do likewise. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is inferior to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a>, can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> material things. Therefore much more can the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The established order of things is for the higher beings to be more perfect than the lower; and for whatever is contained deficiently, partially, and in manifold manner in the lower beings, to be contained in the higher eminently, and in a certain degree of fulness and simplicity. Therefore, in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as in the highest source of things, all things pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> supersubstantially in respect of His simple Being itself, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. 1). But among other creatures the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are nearest to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and resemble Him most; hence they share more fully and more perfectly in the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. iv). Consequently, all material things pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> more simply and less materially even than in themselves, yet in a more manifold manner and less perfectly than in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>Now whatever <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in any subject, is contained in it after the manner of such subject. But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> beings of their own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> material things by His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, so do the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them, forasmuch as they are in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> by their intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The thing understood is the perfection of the one who understands, by reason of the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> which he has in his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. And thus the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> which are in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> are perfections and acts in regard to that <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Sense does not apprehend the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essences</a> of things, but only their outward <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>. In like manner neither does the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>; for it apprehends only the images of bodies. The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> alone apprehends the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essences</a> of things. Hence it is said (De Anima iii, text. 26) that the object of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is "what a thing is," regarding which it does not <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>; as neither does sense regarding its proper sensible object. So therefore the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essences</a> of material things are in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as the thing understood is in him who understands, and not according to their real <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>. But some things are in an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> or in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> according to both <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>; and in either case there is <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> vision.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> were to draw his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of material things from the material things themselves, he would require to make them actually intelligible by a process of <a href="../cathen/01074a.htm">abstraction</a>. But he does not derive his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of them from the material things themselves; he has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of material things by actually intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of things, which <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are connatural to him; just as our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> has, by <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> which it makes intelligible by <a href="../cathen/01074a.htm">abstraction</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether an angel knows singulars?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> singulars. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Poster. i, text. 22): "The sense has for its object singulars, but the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, universals." Now, in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> there is no power of understanding save the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> power, as is evident from what was said above (Question 54, Article 5). Consequently they do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> singulars.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> comes about by some assimilation of the knower to the object <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. But it is not possible for any assimilation to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> between an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> and a singular object, in so far as it is singular; because, as was observed above (Question 50, Article 2), an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is immaterial, while <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is the principle of singularity. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> singulars.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> does <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> singulars, it is either by singular or by universal <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. It is not by singular <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; because in this way he would require to have an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Nor is it by universal <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; since the universal is not the sufficient principle for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the singular as such, because singular things are not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in the universal except <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> singulars.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> No one can guard what he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. But <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> guard <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> men, according to <a href="../bible/psa090.htm#verse11">Psalm 90:11</a>: "He hath given His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> charge over Thee." Consequently the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> singulars.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some have denied to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of singulars. In the first place this derogates from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which asserts that these lower things are administered by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, according to <a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse14">Hebrews 1:14</a>: "They are all ministering spirits." Now, if they had no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of singulars, they could exercise no provision over what is going on in this world; since acts belong to <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>: and this is against the text of <a href="../bible/ecc005.htm#verse5">Ecclesiastes 5:5</a>: "Say not before the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>: There is no <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>."

<p>Secondly, it is also contrary to the teachings of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, according to which the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are stated to be the movers of the heavenly spheres, and to move them according to their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and will.

<p>Consequently others have said that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> possesses <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of singulars, but in their universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, to which all particular effects are reduced; as if the <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a> were to foretell a coming eclipse from the dispositions of the movements of the heavens. This opinion does not escape the aforesaid implications; because, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> a singular, merely in its universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, is not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it as singular, that is, as it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> here and now. The <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> from computation of the heavenly movements that an eclipse is about to happen, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it in the universal; yet he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it as taking place now, except by the senses. But administration, <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> and movement are of singulars, as they are here and now <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a>.

<p>Therefore, it must be said differently, that, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by his various powers of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all classes of things, apprehending universals and immaterial things by his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and things singular and corporeal by the senses, so an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> both by his one <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> power. For the order of things runs in this way, that the higher a thing is, so much the more is its power united and far-reaching: thus in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> himself it is manifest that the <a href="../cathen/04167a.htm">common sense</a> which is higher than the proper sense, although it is but one faculty, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> everything apprehended by the five outward senses, and some other things which no outer sense <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>; for example, the difference between white and sweet. The same is to be observed in other cases. Accordingly, since an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is above <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it is unreasonable to say that a man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> by any one of his powers something which an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> by his one faculty of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, namely, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> pronounces it ridiculous to say that a discord, which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us, should be unknown to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (De Anima i, text. 80; Metaph. text. 15).

<p>The manner in which an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> singular things can be considered from this, that, as things proceed from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in order that they may subsist in their own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, so likewise they proceed in order that they may <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> mind. Now it is clear that there comes forth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> not only whatever belongs to their universal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but likewise all that goes to make up their principles of individuation; since He is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the entire <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the thing, as to both its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. And for as much as He <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, does He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; for His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a thing, as was shown above (Question 14, Article 8). Therefore as by His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, by which He <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> all things, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the likeness of all things, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things, not only as to their universal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, but also as to their singularity; so through the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> imparted to them do the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> things, not only as to their universal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but likewise in their <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>, in so far as they are the manifold representations of that one simple <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> is speaking of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which apprehends only by a process of <a href="../cathen/01074a.htm">abstraction</a>; and by such abstraction from material <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> the thing abstracted becomes a universal. Such a manner of understanding is not in keeping with the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as was said above (55, 2, 3 ad 1), and consequently there is no comparison.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is not according to their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are likened to material things, as one thing resembles another by agreement in genus, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, or <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>; but as the higher bears resemblance to the lower, as the sun does to fire. Even in this way there is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> a resemblance of all things, as to both <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, in so far as there pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in Him as in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> whatever is to be found in things. For the same reason, the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which are images drawn from the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, are the images of things not only as to their form, but also as to their <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Angels <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> singulars by universal forms, which nevertheless are the images of things both as to their universal, and as to their individuating principles. How many things can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, has been already stated above (55, 3, ad 3).

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether angels know the future?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> future events. For <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are mightier in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> than men. But some men <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> many future events. Therefore much more do the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the present and the future are differences of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is above time; because, as is said in De Causis, "an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> keeps pace with <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>," that is, aeviternity. Therefore, to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> mind, past and future are not different, but he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> each indifferently.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> does not understand by <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> derived from things, but by innate universal <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But universal <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> refer equally to present, past, and future. Therefore it appears that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> indifferently things past, present, and future.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, as a thing is spoken of as distant by reason of time, so is it by reason of place. But <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> things which are distant according to place. Therefore they likewise <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> things distant according to future time.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Whatever is the exclusive sign of the Divinity, does not belong to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. But to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> future events is the exclusive sign of the Divinity, according to <a href="../bible/isa041.htm#verse23">Isaiah 41:23</a>: "Show the things that are to come hereafter, and we shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that ye are gods." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> future events.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The future can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in two ways.

<p>First, it can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. And thus, future events which proceed <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> from their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> with sure <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; as that the sun will rise tomorrow. But events which proceed from their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> in the majority of cases, are not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> for certain, but conjecturally; thus the <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctor</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> beforehand the health of the patient. This manner of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> future events <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and by so much the more than it does in us, as they understand the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of things both more universally and more perfectly; thus <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> who penetrate more deeply into the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of an ailment can pronounce a surer verdict on the future issue thereof. But events which proceed from their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> in the minority of cases are quite unknown; such as casual and chance events.

<p>In another way future events are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in themselves. To <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the future in this way belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone; and not merely to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> those events which happen of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, or in the majority of cases, but even casual and chance events; for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sees all things in His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, which, being simple, is present to all time, and embraces all time. And therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> one glance is cast over all things which happen in all time as present before Him; and He beholds all things as they are in themselves, as was said before when dealing with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (14, 13). But the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, and every <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, fall far short of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>; hence the future as it is in itself cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Men cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> future things except in their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, or by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the future in the same way, but much more distinctly.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is above that time according to which corporeal movements are reckoned, yet there is a time in his mind according to the succession of intelligible concepts; of which <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. viii) that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> moves the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> creature according to time." And thus, since there is succession in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, not all things that happen through all time, are present to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> mind.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, in so far as they are <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, refer equally to things present, past, and future; nevertheless the present, past, and future do not bear the same relations to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Present things have a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> according to which they resemble the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>: and so they can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> thereby. Things which are yet to come have not yet a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> whereby they are likened to such <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; consequently, they cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by those <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Things distant according to place are already <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and share in some <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, whose image is in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>; whereas this is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of future things, as has been stated. Consequently there is no comparison.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether angels know secret thoughts?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> secret thoughts. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xviii), explaining <a href="../bible/job028.htm#verse17">Job 28:17</a>: "Gold or crystal cannot equal it," says that "then," namely in the bliss of those rising from the dead, "one shall be as evident to another as he is to himself, and when once the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of each is seen, his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> will at the same time be penetrated." But those who rise shall be like the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as is stated (<a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse30">Matthew 22:30</a>). Therefore an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can see what is in another's <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> bear the same relation to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> as shapes do to bodies. But when the body is seen its shape is seen. Therefore, when an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is seen, the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> within it is also seen. Consequently, when one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> beholds another, or even a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, it seems that he can see the thoughts of both.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> resemble the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> more than do the images in our <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>; because the former are actually understood, while the latter are understood only <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a>. But the images in our <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> as corporeal things are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>: because the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> is a corporeal faculty. Therefore it seems that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the thoughts of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> What is proper to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not belong to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. But it is proper to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to read the secrets of hearts, according to <a href="../bible/jer017.htm#verse9">Jeremiah 17:9</a>: "The heart is perverse above all things, and unsearchable; who can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it? I am the Lord, Who search the heart." Therefore <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the secrets of hearts.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A secret thought can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in two ways: first, in its effect. In this way it can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> not only by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, but also by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; and with so much the greater subtlety according as the effect is the more hidden. For thought is sometimes discovered not merely by outward act, but also by change of countenance; and <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> can tell some <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by the mere pulse. Much more then can <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, or even <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, the more deeply they penetrate those occult bodily modifications. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De divin. daemon.) that <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> "sometimes with the greatest faculty learn <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> dispositions, not only when expressed by speech, but even when conceived in thought, when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> expresses them by certain signs in the body"; although (Retract. ii, 30) he says "it cannot be asserted how this is done."

<p>In another way thoughts can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as they are in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and affections as they are in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: and thus <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the thoughts of hearts and affections of wills. The reason of this is, because the rational creature is subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> only, and He alone can work in it Who is its principal object and last end: this will be developed later (63, 1; 105, 5). Consequently all that is in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and all things that depend only on the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. Now it is evident that it depends entirely on the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> for anyone actually to consider anything; because a man who has a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, or any intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, uses them at will. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse11">1 Corinthians 2:11</a>): "For what <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> the things of a man, but the spirit of a man that is in him?"

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In the present life one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> thought is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by another owing to a twofold hindrance; namely, on account of the grossness of the body, and because the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> shuts up its secrets. The first obstacle will be removed at the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">Resurrection</a>, and does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> at all in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; while the second will remain, and is in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> now. Nevertheless the brightness of the body will show forth the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; as to its amount of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. In this way one will be able to see the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> sees the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of another, by the fact that the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are proportioned to the rank of these <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> according to greater or lesser universality, yet it does not follow that one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how far another makes use of them by actual consideration.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> of the brute does not control its act, but follows the impression of some other corporeal or <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Since, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> corporeal things and their dispositions, they can thereby <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is passing in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> or in the imaginative apprehension of the brute beasts, and even of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in so far as the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> sometimes, through following some bodily impression, influences his conduct, as always happens in brutes. Yet the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the movement of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> and the imaginative apprehension of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in so far as these are moved by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and reason; because, even the lower part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has some share of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, as obeying its ruler, as is said in Ethics iii, 12. But it does not follow that, if the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what is passing through <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> or <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what is in the thought or will: because the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> or <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not subject to the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> or the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, but can make various uses of them.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the angels know the mysteries of grace?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> mysteries of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For, the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> is the most excellent of all mysteries. But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> of it from the beginning; for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. v, 19): "This <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> was hidden in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through the ages, yet so that it was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the princes and powers in heavenly places." And the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse16">1 Timothy 3:16</a>): "That great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of godliness appeared unto <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>." <span class="stiki"><a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Great is the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">godliness</a>, which . . . appeared unto <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.'</span> Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the mysteries of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the reasons of all mysteries of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> are contained in the Divine wisdom. But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> behold <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> wisdom, which is His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Therefore they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the mysteries of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> are enlightened by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as is clear from <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Coel. Hier. iv). But the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> mysteries of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; for it is said (<a href="../bible/amo003.htm#verse7">Amos 3:7</a>): "For the Lord <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> doth nothing without revealing His secret to His servants the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the mysteries of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> No one learns what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> already. Yet even the highest <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> seek out and learn mysteries of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For it is stated (Coel. Hier. vii) that "<a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Sacred Scripture</a> describes some heavenly <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essences</a> as questioning <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and learning from Him the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of His Divine work for us; and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> as teaching them directly": as is evident in <a href="../bible/isa063.htm#verse1">Isaiah 63:1</a>, where, on the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> asking, "Who is he who cometh up from Edom?" <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered, "It is I, Who speak <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> mysteries of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There is a twofold <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. The first is his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, according to which he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> things both by his <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, and by innate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. By such <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> mysteries of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For these mysteries depend upon the pure will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and if an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> cannot learn the thoughts of another <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, which depend upon the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of such <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, much less can he ascertain what depends entirely upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will. The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> reasons in this fashion (<a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse11">1 Corinthians 2:11</a>): "No one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> the things of a man [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'What <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> the things of a man, but . . .?'], but the spirit of a man that is in him." So, "the things also that are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> but the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>."

<p>There is another <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, which renders them <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>; it is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> whereby they see the Word, and things in the Word. By such vision they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> mysteries of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but not all mysteries: nor do they all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them equally; but just as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills them to learn by <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>; as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse10">1 Corinthians 2:10</a>): "But to us <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath revealed them through His Spirit"; yet so that the higher <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> beholding the Divine wisdom more clearly, learn more and deeper mysteries in the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a>, which mysteries they communicate to the lower <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> by enlightening them. Some of these mysteries they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> from the very beginning of their creation; others they are taught afterwards, as befits their ministrations.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> One can speak in two ways of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>.

<p>First of all, in general; and in this way it was revealed to all from the commencement of their beatitude. The reason of this is, that this is a kind of general principle to which all their duties are ordered. For "all are [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Are they not all.'] ministering spirits, sent to minister for them who shall receive the inheritance of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> (<a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse14">Hebrews 1:14</a>)"; and this is brought by the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>. Hence it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for all of them to be instructed in this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> from the very beginning.

<p>We can speak of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> in another way, as to its special <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>. Thus not all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were instructed on all points from the beginning; even the higher <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> learned these afterwards, as appears from the passage of <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> already quoted.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in bliss behold the Divine wisdom, yet they do not comprehend it. So it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for them to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> everything hidden in it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Whatever the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> by <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> of the mysteries of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, was revealed in a more excellent way to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. And although <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> revealed in general to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> what He was one day to do regarding the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, still the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> some particulars of the same, which the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. Thus we read (<a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse4">Ephesians 3:4-5</a>): "As you reading, may understand my <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which in other generations was not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the sons of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as it is now revealed to His holy <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>." Among the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> also, the later ones <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what the former did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; according to <a href="../bible/psa118.htm#verse100">Psalm 118:100</a>: "I have had understanding above ancients," and <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says: "The <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Divine things increased as time went on" (Hom. xvi in Ezech.).
