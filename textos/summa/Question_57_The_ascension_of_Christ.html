<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether it was fitting for Christ to ascend into heaven?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it was not fitting for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascend into heaven</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Coelo ii) that "things which are in a state of perfection possess their <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> without movement." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was in a state of perfection, since He is the Sovereign Good in respect of His Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, and sovereignly glorified in respect of His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Consequently, He has His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> without movement. But ascension is movement. Therefore it was not fitting for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascend</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever is moved, is moved on account of something better. But it was no better thing for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> than upon earth, because He gained nothing either in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> or in body by being in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should not have <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended into heaven</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> took <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. But it would have been more beneficial for men if He had tarried always with us upon earth; thus He said to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> (<a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse22">Luke 17:22</a>): "The days will come when you shall desire to see one day of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>; and you shall not see it." Therefore it seems unfitting for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to have <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended into heaven</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xiv), <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was in no way changed after the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>. But He did not <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascend into heaven</a> immediately after rising again, for He said after the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse17">John 20:17</a>): "I am not yet <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended</a> to My Father." Therefore it seems that neither should He have <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended</a> after forty days.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Are the words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse17">John 20:17</a>): "I <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascend</a> to My Father and to your Father."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The place ought to be in keeping with what is contained therein. Now by His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> entered upon an <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and incorruptible life. But whereas our dwelling-place is one of generation and corruption, the heavenly place is one of incorruption. And consequently it was not fitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should remain upon earth after the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>; but it was fitting that He should <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascend to heaven</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> That which is best and possesses its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> without movement is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, because He is utterly unchangeable, according to <a href="../bible/mal003.htm#verse6">Malachi 3:6</a>: "I am the Lord, and I change not." But every creature is changeable in some respect, as is evident from <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. viii). And since the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> assumed by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> remained a creature, as is clear from what was said above (2, 7; 16, 8,10; 20, 1), it is not unbecoming if some movement be attributed to it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> By <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascending into heaven</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> acquired no addition to His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> either in body or in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: nevertheless He did acquire something as to the fittingness of place, which pertains to the well-being of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: not that His body acquired anything from a heavenly body by way of perfection or preservation; but merely out of a certain fittingness. Now this in a measure belonged to His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; and He had a certain kind of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> from such fittingness, not indeed that He then began to derive <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> from it when He <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended into heaven</a>, but that He rejoiced thereat in a new way, as at a thing completed. Hence, on <a href="../bible/psa015.htm#verse11">Psalm 15:11</a>: "At Thy right hand are delights even unto the end," the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "I shall delight in sitting nigh to Thee, when I shall be taken away from the sight of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> bodily presence was withdrawn from the faithful by the <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a>, still the presence of His Godhead is ever with the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, as He Himself says (<a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse20">Matthew 28:20</a>): "Behold, I am with you all days, even to the consummation of the world." For, "by <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascending into heaven</a> He did not abandon those whom He adopted," as Pope Leo says (De Resurrec., Serm. ii). But <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Christ's Ascension into heaven</a>, whereby He withdrew His bodily presence from us, was more profitable for us than His bodily presence would have been.

<p>First of all, in order to increase our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which is of things unseen. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/joh016.htm">John 16</a>) that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> shall come and "convince the world . . . of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>," that is, of the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> "of those that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. xcv super Joan.): "For even to put the faithful beside the unbeliever is to put the unbeliever to shame"; wherefore he goes on to say (10): "'Because I go to the Father; and you shall see Me no longer'"--"For 'blessed are they that see not, yet <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.' Hence it is of our <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> that the world is reproved: because 'you will <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Me whom you shall not see.'"

<p>Secondly, to uplift our hope: hence He says (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse3">John 14:3</a>): "If I shall go, and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and will take you to Myself; that where I am, you also may be." For by placing in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which He assumed, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> gave us the hope of going thither; since "wheresoever the body shall be, there shall the eagles also be gathered together," as is written in <a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse28">Matthew 24:28</a>. Hence it is written likewise (<a href="../bible/mic002.htm#verse13">Micah 2:13</a>): "He shall go up that shall open the way before them."

<p>Thirdly, in order to direct the fervor of our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> to heavenly things. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse1">Colossians 3:1-2</a>): "Seek the things that are above, where <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is sitting at the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Mind the things that are above, not the things that are upon the earth": for as is said (<a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse21">Matthew 6:21</a>): "Where thy treasure is, there is thy heart also." And since the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is love drawing us up to heavenly things, therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> (<a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse7">John 16:7</a>): "It is expedient to you that I go; for if I go not, the Paraclete will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you." On which words <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. xciv super Joan.): "Ye cannot receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, so long as ye persist in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> according to the flesh. But when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> withdrew in body, not only the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, but both Father and Son were present with them spiritually."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Although a heavenly place befitted <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> when He rose to <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> life, nevertheless He delayed the <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a> in order to confirm the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse3">Acts 1:3</a>), that "He showed Himself alive after His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, by many <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, for forty days appearing to them": upon which the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says that "because He was dead for forty hours, during forty days He established the fact of His being alive again. Or the forty days may be understood as a figure of this world, wherein <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> dwells in His Church: inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is made out of the four elements, and is cautioned not to transgress the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">Decalogue</a>."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether Christ's Ascension into heaven belonged to Him according to His Divine Nature?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Christ's Ascension</a> into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> belonged to Him according to His Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>. For, it is written (<a href="../bible/psa046.htm#verse6">Psalm 46:6</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is ascended with jubilee": and (<a href="../bible/deu033.htm#verse26">Deuteronomy 33:26</a>): "He that is mounted upon the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is thy helper." But these words were spoken of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> even before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>. Therefore it belongs to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascend into heaven</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it belongs to the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascend into heaven</a> as to descend from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse13">John 3:13</a>: "No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hath <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended into heaven</a>, but He that descended from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>": and <a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse10">Ephesians 4:10</a>: "He that descended is the same also that <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended</a>." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> came down from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> not as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: because previously His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> was not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, but Divine. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended into heaven</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, by His <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended</a> to the Father. But it was not as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that He rose to equality with the Father; for in this respect He says: "He is greater than I," as is said in <a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse28">John 14:28</a>. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> on <a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse10">Ephesians 4:10</a>: "That He <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended</a>, what is it, but because He also descended," a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "It is clear that He descended and <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended</a> according to His humanity."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The expression "according to" can denote two things; the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the one who <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascends</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of his <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascension</a>. When taken to express the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the one ascending, the <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a> in no wise belongs to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> according to the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of His Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>; both because there is nothing higher than the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> to which He can <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascend</a>; and because ascension is local motion, a thing not in keeping with the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, which is immovable and outside all place. Yet the <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a> is in keeping with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> according to His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which is limited by place, and can be the subject of motion. In this sense, then, we can say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended into heaven</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but not as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>But if the phrase "according to" denote the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a>, since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended into heaven</a> in virtue of His Godhead, and not in virtue of His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, then it must be said that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended into heaven</a> not as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a sermon on the <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a>: "It was our doing that the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> hung upon the cross; but it was His own doing that He <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> These utterances were spoken <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who was one day to become incarnate. Still it can be said that although to <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascend</a> does not belong to the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> properly, yet it can metaphorically; as, for instance, it is said "to ascend in the heart of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" (cf. <a href="../bible/psa083.htm#verse6">Psalm 83:6</a>), when his heart submits and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbles</a> itself before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and in the same way <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said to ascend metaphorically with regard to every creature, since He subjects it to Himself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> He who <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended</a> is the same as He who descended. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Symb. iv): "Who is it that descends? The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>-Man. Who is it that <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascends</a>? The self-same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>-Man." Nevertheless a twofold descent is attributed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; one, whereby He is said to have descended from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, which is attributed to the God-Man according as He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: for He is not to be understood as having descended by any local movement, but as having "emptied Himself," since "when He was in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> He took the form of a servant." For just as He is said to be emptied, not by losing His fulness, but because He took our littleness upon Himself, so likewise He is said to have descended from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, not that He deserted <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, but because He assumed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in unity of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p>And there is another descent whereby He descended "into the lower regions of the earth," as is written <a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse9">Ephesians 4:9</a>; and this is local descent: hence this belongs to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> according to the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is said to <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascend</a> to the Father, inasmuch as He <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascends</a> to sit on the right hand of the Father; and this is befitting <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in a measure according to His Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, and in a measure according to His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as will be said later (58, 3)

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether Christ ascended by His own power?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascend</a> by His own power, because it is written (<a href="../bible/mar016.htm#verse19">Mark 16:19</a>) that "the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, after He had spoken to them, was taken up to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>"; and (<a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse9">Acts 1:9</a>) that, "while they looked on, He was raised up, and a cloud received Him out of their sight." But what is taken up, and lifted up, appears to be moved by another. Consequently, it was not by His own power, but by another's that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was taken up into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> was an earthly body, like to ours. But it is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an earthly body to be borne upwards. Moreover, what is moved contrary to its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is nowise moved by its own power. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascend to heaven</a> by His own power.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> own power is Divine. But this motion does not seem to have been Divine, because, whereas the Divine power is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, such motion would be instantaneous; consequently, He would not have been uplifted to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> "while" the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> "looked on," as is stated in <a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse9">Acts 1:9</a>. Therefore, it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascend to heaven</a> by His own power.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/isa063.htm#verse1">Isaiah 63:1</a>): "This beautiful one in his robe, walking in the greatness of his strength." Also <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says in a Homily on the Ascension (xxix): "It is to be noted that we read of Elias having ascended in a chariot, that it might be shown that one who was mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needed another's help. But we do not read of our Saviour being lifted up either in a chariot or by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, because He who had made all things was taken up above all things by His own power."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There is a twofold <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, to wit, the Divine and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>. Hence His own power can be accepted according to both. Likewise a twofold power can be accepted regarding His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: one is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, flowing from the principles of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and it is quite evident that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascend into heaven</a> by such power as this. The other is the power of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, which is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and it was according to this that He <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended to heaven</a>.

<p>Now there are some who endeavor to assign the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of this power to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the fifth <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. This, as they say, is light, which they make out to be of the composition of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, and by which they contend that contrary elements are reconciled; so that in the state of this mortality, elemental <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is predominant in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> bodies: so that, according to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of this predominating element the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body is borne downwards by its own power: but in the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> the heavenly <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> will predominate, by whose tendency and power <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body and the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are lifted up to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. But we have already treated of this opinion in I, 76, 7, and shall deal with it more fully in treating of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">general resurrection</a> (XP, 84, 1).

<p>Setting this opinion aside, others assign as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of this power the glorified <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself, from whose overflow the body will be glorified, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> writes to Dioscorus (Ep. cxviii). For the glorified body will be so submissive to the glorified <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xxii), "wheresoever the spirit listeth, thither the body will be on the instant; nor will the spirit desire anything unbecoming to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> or the body." Now it is befitting the glorified and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> body for it to be in a heavenly place, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Consequently, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended into heaven</a> by the power of His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> willing it. But as the body is made <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> by participation with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, even so, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. xxiii in Joan.), "the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is beatified by participating in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Consequently, the Divine power is the first source of the <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascent into heaven</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended into heaven</a> by His own power, first of all by His Divine power, and secondly by the power of His glorified <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> moving His body at will.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is said to have risen by His own power, though He was raised to life by the power of the Father, since the Father's power is the same as the Son's; so also <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended into heaven</a> by His own power, and yet was raised up and taken up to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> by the Father.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument proves that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascend into heaven</a> by His own power, i.e. that which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: yet He did <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascend</a> by His own power, i.e. His Divine power, as well as by His own power, i.e. the power of His beatified <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And although to mount upwards is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body in its present <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, in which the body is not entirely dominated by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, still it will not be unnatural or forced in a glorified body, whose entire <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is utterly under the control of the spirit.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although the Divine power be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, and operate <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a>, so far as the worker is concerned, still the effect thereof is received in things according to their capacity, and as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> disposes. Now a body is incapable of being moved locally in an instant, because it must be commensurate with space, according to the division of which time is reckoned, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in Physics vi. Consequently, it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for a body moved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be moved instantaneously, but with such speed as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> disposes.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether Christ ascended above all the heavens?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascend</a> above all the heavens, for it is written (<a href="../bible/psa010.htm#verse5">Psalm 10:5</a>): "The Lord is in His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> temple, the Lord's throne is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>." But what is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is not above <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascend</a> above all the heavens.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> [This objection with its solution is omitted in the Leonine edition as not being in the original manuscript.]

<p>Further, there is no place above the heavens, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in De Coelo i. But every body must occupy a place. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body did not <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascend</a> above all the heavens.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, two bodies cannot occupy the same place. Since, then, there is no passing from place to place except through the middle space, it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> could not have <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended</a> above all the heavens unless <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> were divided; which is impossible.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it is narrated (<a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse9">Acts 1:9</a>) that "a cloud received Him out of their sight." But clouds cannot be uplifted beyond <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Consequently, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascend</a> above all the heavens.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> will dwell for ever in the place whither He has <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended</a>. But what is against <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> cannot last for ever, because what is according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is more prevalent and of more frequent occurrence. Therefore, since it is contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> for an earthly body to be above <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body did not <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascend</a> above <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse10">Ephesians 4:10</a>): "He <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended</a> above all the heavens that He might fill all things."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The more fully anything corporeal shares in the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, the higher its place in the corporeal order, which is order of place. Hence we see that the more formal bodies are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> the higher, as is clear from the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Phys. iv; De Coelo ii), since it is by its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> that every body partakes of the Divine Essence, as is shown in Physics i. But through <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> the body derives a greater share in the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> than any other <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> body does through its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> form; while among other <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> bodies it is manifest that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body shines with greater <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Hence it was most fitting for it to be set above all bodies. Thus it is that on <a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse8">Ephesians 4:8</a>: "<a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascending</a> on high," the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "in place and dignity."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> seat is said to be in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, not as though <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> contained Him, but rather because it is contained by Him. Hence it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for any part of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> to be higher, but for Him to be above all the heavens; according to <a href="../bible/psa008.htm#verse2">Psalm 8:2</a>: "For Thy magnificence is elevated above the heavens, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>!"

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> [Omitted in Leonine edition; see Objection 2] A place implies the notion of containing; hence the first container has the formality of first place, and such is the first <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Therefore bodies need in themselves to be in a place, in so far as they are contained by a heavenly body. But glorified bodies, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> especially, do not stand in need of being so contained, because they draw nothing from the heavenly bodies, but from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. So there is nothing to prevent <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body from being beyond the containing radius of the heavenly bodies, and not in a containing place. Nor is there need for a vacuum to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> outside <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, since there is no place there, nor is there any <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> susceptive of a body, but the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> of reaching thither lies in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. So when <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> proves (De Coelo ii) that there is no body beyond <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, this must be understood of bodies which are in a state of pure <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as is seen from the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although it is not of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a body for it to be in the same place with another body, yet <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can bring it about <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> that a body be with another in the same place, as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did when He went forth from the Virgin's sealed womb, also when He entered among the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> through closed doors, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xxvi). Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body can be in the same place with another body, not through some inherent property in the body, but through the assistance and operation of the Divine power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> That cloud afforded no support as a vehicle to the <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascending</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: but it appeared as a sign of the Godhead, just as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> appeared to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> in a cloud over the Tabernacle (<a href="../bible/exo040.htm#verse15">Exodus 40:32</a>; <a href="../bible/num009.htm#verse15">Numbers 9:15</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> A glorified body has the power to be in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> or above <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. not from its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> principles, but from the beatified <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, from which it derives its <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: and just as the upward motion of a glorified body is not <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a>, so neither is its rest <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a>: consequently, there is nothing to prevent it from being everlasting.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether Christ's body ascended above every spiritual creature?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body did not <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascend</a> above every <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> creature. For no fitting comparison can be made between things which have no common ratio. But place is not predicated in the same ratio of bodies and of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> creatures, as is evident from what was said in I, 8, 2, ad 1,2 and I, 52, 1. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body cannot be said to have <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended</a> above every <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> creature.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Vera Relig. lv) that a spirit always takes precedence over a body. But the higher place is due to the higher things. Therefore it does not seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended</a> above every <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> creature.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in every place a body <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>, since there is no such thing as a vacuum in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore if no body obtains a higher place than a spirit in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> bodies, then there will be no place above every <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> creature. Consequently, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body could not <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascend</a> above every <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> creature.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse21">Ephesians 1:21</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> set Him above all principality, and Power, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The more exalted place is due to the nobler subject, whether it be a place according to bodily contact, as regards bodies, or whether it be by way of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> contact, as regards <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>; thus a heavenly place which is the highest of places is becomingly due to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, since they are highest in the order of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. But although <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body is beneath <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, if we weigh the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of its corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, nevertheless it surpasses all <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> in dignity, when we call to mind its dignity of union whereby it is united personally with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Consequently, owing to this very fittingness, a higher place is due to it above every <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> creature. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says in a Homily on the Ascension (xxix in Evang.) that "He who had made all things, was by His own power raised up above all things."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although a place is differently attributed to corporeal and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, still in either case this remains in common, that the higher place is assigned to the worthier.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument holds good of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body according to the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of its corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but not according to its formality of union.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This comparison may be considered either on the part of the places; and thus there is no place so high as to exceed the dignity of a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>: in this sense the objection runs. Or it may be considered on the part of the dignity of the things to which a place is attributed: and in this way it is due to the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be above <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> creatures.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether Christ's Ascension is the cause of our salvation?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Christ's Ascension</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in so far as He <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> it. But He <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> nothing for us by His <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a>, because His <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a> belongs to the reward of His exaltation: and the same thing is not both <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> and reward, just as neither are a road and its terminus the same. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Christ's Ascension</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Christ's Ascension</a> be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, it seems that this is principally due to the fact that His <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of ours. But this was bestowed upon us by His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, for it is written (<a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse19">Hebrews 10:19</a>): "We have [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Having'] confidence in the entering into the holies by" His "blood." Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Christ's Ascension</a> was not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> bestows is an everlasting one, according to <a href="../bible/isa051.htm#verse6">Isaiah 51:6</a>: "My <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> shall be for ever." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascend into heaven</a> to remain there <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>; for it is written (<a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse11">Acts 1:11</a>): "He shall so come as you have seen Him going, into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>." Besides, we read of Him showing Himself to many <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> people on earth after He went up to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, for instance (<a href="../bible/act009.htm">Acts 9</a>). Consequently, it seems that <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Christ's Ascension</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> He Himself said (<a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse7">John 16:7</a>): "It is expedient to you that I go"; i.e. that I should leave you and <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascend into heaven</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Christ's Ascension</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in two ways: first of all, on our part; secondly, on His.

<p>On our part, in so far as by the <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a> our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are uplifted to Him; because, as stated above (1, ad 3), His <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a> fosters, first, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; secondly, hope; thirdly, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Fourthly, our reverence for Him is thereby increased, since we no longer deem Him an earthly <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>; thus the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse16">2 Corinthians 5:16</a>): "If we have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> according to the flesh--'that is, as mortal, whereby we reputed Him as a mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>,'" as the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> interprets the words--"but now we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him so no longer."

<p>On His part, in regard to those things which, in <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascending</a>, He did for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. First, He prepared the way for our ascent into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, according to His own saying (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse2">John 14:2</a>): "I go to prepare a place for you," and the words of Micheas (<a href="../bible/mic002.htm#verse13">2:13</a>), "He shall go up that shall open the way before them." For since He is our Head the members must follow whither the Head has gone: hence He said (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse3">John 14:3</a>): "That where I am, you also may be." In sign whereof He took to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> delivered from <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse19">Psalm 67:19</a> (Cf. <a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse8">Ephesians 4:8</a>): "<a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascending</a> on high, He led captivity captive," because He took with Him to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> those who had been held captives by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>--to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, as to a place strange to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. captives in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> of a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> taking, since they were acquired by His victory.

<p>Secondly, because as the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> under the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> entered the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place to stand before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the people, so also <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> entered <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> "to make intercession for us," as is said in <a href="../bible/heb007.htm#verse25">Hebrews 7:25</a>. Because the very showing of Himself in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which He took with Him to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is a pleading for us. so that for the very reason that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> so exalted <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, He may take pity on them for whom the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> took <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Thirdly, that being established in His heavenly seat as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Lord, He might send down <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> upon men, according to <a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse10">Ephesians 4:10</a>: "He <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended</a> above all the heavens, that He might fill all things," that is, "with His <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>," according to the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Christ's Ascension</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by way not of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, but of efficiency, as was stated above regarding His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> (56, 1, ad 3,4).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our ascending to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, properly speaking, by removing the hindrance which is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and also by way of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>: whereas <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Christ's Ascension</a> is the direct <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our ascension, as by beginning it in Him who is our Head, with whom the members must be united.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by once <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascending into heaven</a> acquired for Himself and for us in perpetuity the right and worthiness of a heavenly dwelling-place; which worthiness suffers in no way, if, from some special dispensation, He sometimes comes down in body to earth; either in order to show Himself to the whole world, as at the judgment; or else to show Himself particularly to some <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, e.g. in <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> case, as we read in <a href="../bible/act009.htm">Acts 9</a>. And lest any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may think that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not bodily present when this occurred, the contrary is shown from what the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says in <a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse8">1 Corinthians 14:8</a>, to confirm <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>: "Last of all He was seen also by me, as by one born out of due time": which vision would not confirm the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> except he had beheld <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> very body.
