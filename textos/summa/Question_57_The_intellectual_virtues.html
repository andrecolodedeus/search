<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the habits of the speculative intellect are virtues?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of the speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> are not <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is an operative <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, as we have said above (Question 55, Article 2). But speculative <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are not operative: for speculative <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is distinct from practical, i.e. operative <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of the speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> are not <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is about those things by which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is made <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> or blessed: for "<a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is the reward of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>" (Ethic. i, 9). Now <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> do not consider <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> or other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> goods, by which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> acquires <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, but rather things pertaining to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore such like <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> cannot be called <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, science is a speculative <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. But science and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are distinct from one another as genera which are not subalternate, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proves in Topic. iv. Therefore speculative <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are not <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The speculative <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> alone consider <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> things which cannot be otherwise than they are. Now the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vi, 1) places certain <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in that part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which considers <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> things that cannot be otherwise than they are. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of the speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> are <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is ordained to some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as stated above (Question 55, Article 3), a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, as we have already observed (56, 3), may be called a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> for two reasons: first, because it confers aptness in doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; secondly, because besides aptness, it confers the right use of it. The latter <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, as above stated (55, 3), belongs to those <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> alone which affect the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: since it is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power that puts all the powers and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> to their respective uses.

<p>Since, then, the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of the speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> do not perfect the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> part, nor affect it in any way, but only the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> part; they may indeed be called <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in so far as they confer aptness for a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work, viz. the consideration of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> (since this is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>): yet they are not called <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in the second way, as though they conferred the right use of a power or <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. For if a man possess a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of speculative science, it does not follow that he is inclined to make use of it, but he is made able to consider the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in those matters of which he has scientific <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: that he make use of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which he has, is due to the motion of his will. Consequently a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which perfects the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> or <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, confers the right use of these speculative <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>. And in this way too there can be <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> in the acts of these <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, if they be done out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: thus <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. vi) that the "contemplative life has greater <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> than the active life."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Work is of two kinds, exterior and interior. Accordingly the practical or active faculty which is contrasted with the speculative faculty, is concerned with exterior work, to which the speculative <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is not ordained. Yet it is ordained to the interior act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> which is to consider the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And in this way it is an operative <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Virtue is about certain things in two ways. In the first place a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is about its object. And thus these speculative <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not about those things whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is made <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>; except perhaps, in so far as the word "whereby" indicates the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> or object of complete <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, i.e. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is the supreme object of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>. Secondly, a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is said to be about its acts: and in this sense the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are about those things whereby a man is made <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>; both because the acts of these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> can be <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>, as stated above, and because they are a kind of beginning of perfect bliss, which consists in the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as we have already stated (3, 7).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Science is contrasted with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> taken in the second sense, wherein it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> faculty.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether there are only three habits of the speculative intellect, viz. wisdom, science and understanding?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem unfitting to distinguish three <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of the speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, viz. wisdom, science and understanding. Because a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is a kind of science, as stated in Ethic. vi, 7. Therefore wisdom should not be condivided with science among the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in differentiating powers, <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> and acts in respect of their objects, we consider chiefly the formal aspect of these objects, as we have already explained (I, 77, 3). Therefore diversity of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> is taken, not from their material objects, but from the formal aspect of those objects. Now the principle of a demonstration is the formal aspect under which the conclusion is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Therefore the understanding of principles should not be set down as a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> or <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> distinct from the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of conclusions.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is one which resides in the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> rational faculty. Now even the speculative reason employs the dialectic syllogism for the sake of argument, just as it employs the demonstrative syllogism. Therefore as science, which is the result of a demonstrative syllogism, is set down as an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, so also should opinion be.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vi, 1) reckons these three alone as being <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, viz. wisdom, science and understanding.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As already stated (1), the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of the speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> are those which perfect the speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> for the consideration of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: for this is its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work. Now a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is subject to a twofold consideration--as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in itself, and as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through another. What is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in itself, is as a "principle," and is at once understood by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> that perfects the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> for the consideration of such <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is called "understanding," which is the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of principles.

<p>On the other hand, a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through another, is understood by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, not at once, but by means of the reason's inquiry, and is as a "term." This may happen in two ways: first, so that it is the last in some particular genus; secondly, so that it is the ultimate term of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. And, since "things that are knowable last from our standpoint, are knowable first and chiefly in their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>" (Phys. i, text. 2, 3); hence that which is last with respect to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, is that which is knowable first and chiefly in its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. And about these is "wisdom," which considers the highest <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, as stated in Metaph. i, 1,2. Wherefore it rightly judges all things and sets them in order, because there can be no perfect and universal judgment that is not based on the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. But in regard to that which is last in this or that genus of knowable <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, it is "science" which perfects the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Wherefore according to the different kinds of knowable <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, there are different <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of scientific <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; whereas there is but one wisdom.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Wisdom is a kind of science, in so far as it has that which is common to all the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>; viz. to demonstrate conclusions from principles. But since it has something proper to itself above the other <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, inasmuch as it judges of them all, not only as to their conclusions, but also as to their first principles, therefore it is a more perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than science.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When the formal aspect of the object is referred to a power or <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> by one same act, there is no distinction of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> or power in respect of the formal aspect and of the material object: thus it belongs to the same power of sight to see both color, and light, which is the formal aspect under which color is seen, and is seen at the same time as the color. On the other hand, the principles of a demonstration can be considered apart, without the conclusion being considered at all. Again they can be considered together with the conclusions, since the conclusions can be <a href="../cathen/04674a.htm">deduced</a> from them. Accordingly, to consider the principles in this second way, belongs to science, which considers the conclusions also: while to consider the principles in themselves belongs to understanding.

<p>Consequently, if we consider the point aright, these three <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are distinct, not as being on a par with one another, but in a certain order. The same is to be observed in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a> wholes, wherein one part is more perfect than another; for instance, the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is more perfect than the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and the sensitive, than the vegetal. For it is thus that science depends on understanding as on a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of higher degree: and both of these depend on wisdom, as obtaining the highest place, and containing beneath itself both understanding and science, by judging both of the conclusions of science, and of the principles on which they are based.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (55, A3,4), a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> has a fixed relation to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and is nowise referable to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and falsehood is its <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Wherefore those <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> alone are called <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, whereby we tell the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and never tell a falsehood. But opinion and suspicion can be about both <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and falsehood: and so, as stated in Ethic. vi, 3, they are not <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the intellectual habit, art, is a virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that art is not an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Lib. Arb. ii, 18,19) that "no one makes bad use of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>." But one may make bad use of art: for a craftsman can work badly according to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of his art. Therefore art is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, there is no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But "there is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of art," according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vi, 5). Therefore art is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the liberal arts excel the mechanical arts. But just as the mechanical arts are practical, so the liberal arts are speculative. Therefore, if art were an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, it would have to be reckoned among the speculative <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vi, 3,4) says that art is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and yet he does not reckon it among the speculative <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, which, according to him, reside in the scientific part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Art is nothing else but "the right reason about certain works to be made." And yet the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of these things depends, not on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> faculty being affected in this or that way, but on the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the work done. For a craftsman, as such, is commendable, not for the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> with which he does a work, but for the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of the work. Art, therefore, properly speaking, is an operative <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. And yet it has something in common with the speculative <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>: since the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of the object considered by the latter is a matter of concern to them also, but not how the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> may be affected towards that object. For as long as the geometrician demonstrates the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, it matters not how his <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> faculty may be affected, whether he be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joyful</a> or <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>: even as neither does this matter in a craftsman, as we have observed. And so art has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in the same way as the speculative <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, in so far, to wit, as neither art nor speculative <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> makes a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work as regards the use of the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, which is the property of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that perfects the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, but only as regards the aptness to work well.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> When anyone endowed with an art produces bad workmanship, this is not the work of that art, in fact it is contrary to the art: even as when a man lies, while <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, his words are not in accord with his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but contrary thereto. Wherefore, just as science has always a relation to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as stated above (2, ad 3), so it is with art: and it is for this reason that it is called a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. And yet it falls short of being a perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, because it does not make its possessor to use it well; for which purpose something further is requisite: although there cannot be a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> use without the art.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In order that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may make <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> use of the art he has, he needs a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will, which is perfected by moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and for this reason the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says that there is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of art; namely, a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, in so far as the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> use of art requires a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For it is evident that a craftsman is inclined by <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which rectifies his will, to do his work faithfully.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Even in speculative matters there is something by way of work: e.g. the making of a syllogism or of a fitting speech, or the work of counting or measuring. Hence whatever <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are ordained to such like works of the speculative reason, are, by a kind of comparison, called arts indeed, but "liberal" arts, in order to distinguish them from those arts that are ordained to works done by the body, which arts are, in a fashion, servile, inasmuch as the body is in servile subjection to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as regards his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, is free [liber]. On the other hand, those <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> which are not ordained to any such like work, are called <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> simply, and not arts. Nor, if the liberal arts be more excellent, does it follow that the notion of art is more applicable to them.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether prudence is a distinct virtue from art?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is not a distinct <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> from art. For art is the right reason about certain works. But diversity of works does not make a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> cease to be an art; since there are various arts about works widely different. Since therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is also right reason about works, it seems that it too should be reckoned a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> has more in common with art than the speculative <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> have; for they are both "about contingent matters that may be otherwise than they are" (Ethic. vi, 4,5). Now some speculative <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are called arts. Much more, therefore, should <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> be called an art.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it belongs to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, "to be of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel" (Ethic. vi, 5). But counselling takes place in certain arts also, as stated in Ethic. iii, 3, e.g. in the arts of warfare, of seamanship, and of medicine. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is not distinct from art.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> distinguishes <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> from art (Ethic. vi, 5).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Where the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> differs, there is a different kind of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now it has been stated above (1; 56, 3) that some <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> have the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, through merely conferring aptness for a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work: while some <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, not only through conferring aptness for a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work, but also through conferring the use. But art confers the mere aptness for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work; since it does not regard the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; whereas <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> confers not only aptness for a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work, but also the use: for it regards the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, since it presupposes the rectitude thereof.

<p>The reason for this difference is that art is the "right reason of things to be made"; whereas <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is the "right reason of things to be done." Now "making" and "doing" differ, as stated in Metaph. ix, text. 16, in that "making" is an action passing into outward <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, e.g. "to build," "to saw," and so forth; whereas "doing" is an action abiding in the agent, e.g. "to see," "to will," and the like. Accordingly <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> stands in the same relation to such like <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions, consisting in the use of powers and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, as art does to outward making: since each is the perfect reason about the things with which it is concerned. But perfection and rectitude of reason in speculative matters, depend on the principles from which reason argues; just as we have said above (2, ad 2) that science depends on and presupposes understanding, which is the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of principles. Now in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> the end is what the principles are in speculative matters, as stated in Ethic. vii, 8. Consequently, it is requisite for <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, which is right reason about things to be done, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be well disposed with regard to the ends: and this depends on the rectitude of his <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Wherefore, for <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> there is need of a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which rectifies the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. On the other hand the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things made by art is not the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of those things themselves: wherefore art does not presuppose rectitude of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. The consequence is that more praise is given to a craftsman who is at fault willingly, than to one who is unwillingly; whereas it is more contrary to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> willingly than unwillingly, since rectitude of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, but not to art. Accordingly it is evident that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> distinct from art.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The various kinds of things made by art are all external to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: hence they do not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a different kind of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is right reason about <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> themselves: hence it is a distinct kind of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">Prudence</a> has more in common with art than a speculative <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> has, if we consider their subject and <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: for they are both in the thinking part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and about things that may be otherwise than they are. But if we consider them as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, then art has more in common with the speculative <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, as is clear from what has been said.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">Prudence</a> is of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel about matters regarding <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> entire life, and the end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life. But in some arts there is counsel about matters concerning the ends proper to those arts. Hence some men, in so far as they are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counselors in matters of warfare, or seamanship, are said to be <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> officers or pilots, but not simply <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>: only those are simply <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> who give <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel about all the concerns of life.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether prudence is a virtue necessary to man?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to lead a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> life. For as art is to things that are made, of which it is the right reason, so is <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> to things that are done, in respect of which we judge of a man's life: for <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is the right reason about these things, as stated in Ethic. vi, 5. Now art is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in things that are made, save in order that they be made, but not after they have been made. Neither, therefore is <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in order to lead a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> life, after he has become <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>; but perhaps only in order that he may become <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "It is by <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> that we are of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel," as stated in Ethic. vi, 5. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can act not only from his own, but also from another's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not need <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> in order to lead a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> life, but it is enough that he follow the counsels of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> men.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is one by which one always tells the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and never a falsehood. But this does not seem to be the case with <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>: for it is not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> never to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> in taking counsel about what is to be done; since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions are about things that may be otherwise than they are. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/wis009.htm#verse14">Wisdom 9:14</a>): "The thoughts of mortal men are fearful, and our counsels uncertain." Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> should not be reckoned an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is reckoned with other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, when it is written (<a href="../bible/wis008.htm#verse7">Wisdom 8:7</a>) of Divine Wisdom: "She teacheth <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, which are such things as men can have nothing more profitable in life."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">Prudence</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> most <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life. For a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> life consists in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. Now in order to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, it matters not only what a man does, but also how he does it; to wit, that he do it from right choice and not merely from impulse or passion. And, since choice is about things in reference to the end, rectitude of choice requires two things: namely, the due end, and something suitably ordained to that due end. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is suitably directed to his due end by a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which perfects the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> part, the object of which is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and the end. And to that which is suitably ordained to the due end <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs to be rightly disposed by a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> in his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, because counsel and choice, which are about things ordained to the end, are acts of the reason. Consequently an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is needed in the reason, to perfect the reason, and make it suitably affected towards things ordained to the end; and this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Consequently <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to lead a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> life.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of an art is to be found, not in the craftsman, but in the product of the art, since art is right reason about things to be made: for since the making of a thing passes into external <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, it is a perfection not of the maker, but of the thing made, even as movement is the act of the thing moved: and art is concerned with the making of things. On the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is in the active principle, whose activity is its perfection: for <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is right reason about things to be done, as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>). Consequently art does not require of the craftsman that his act be a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> act, but that his work be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Rather would it be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the thing made to act well (e.g. that a knife should carve well, or that a saw should cut well), if it were proper to such things to act, rather than to be acted on, because they have not dominion over their actions. Wherefore the craftsman needs art, not that he may live well, but that he may produce a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work of art, and have it in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> keeping: whereas <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that he may lead a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> life, and not merely that he may be a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When a man does a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, not of his own counsel, but moved by that of another, his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> is not yet quite perfect, as regards his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> in directing him and his <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> in moving him. Wherefore, if he do a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, he does not do well simply; and yet this is required in order that he may lead a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> life.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated in Ethic. vi, 2, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not the same for the practical as for the speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Because the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> depends on conformity between the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and the thing. And since the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> cannot be infallibly in conformity with things in contingent matters, but only in <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> matters, therefore no speculative <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> about contingent things is an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but only such as is about <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> things. On the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> depends on conformity with right <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. This conformity has no place in <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> matters, which are not affected by the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will; but only in contingent matters which can be effected by us, whether they be matters of interior action, or the products of external work. Hence it is only about contingent matters that an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is assigned to the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, viz. art, as regards things to be made, and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, as regards things to be done.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether "eubulia, synesis, and gnome" are virtues annexed to prudence? [<em>euboulia, synesis, gnome</em>]</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that "<em>euboulia, synesis</em>, and <em>gnome</em>" are unfittingly assigned as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> annexed to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. For "<em>euboulia</em>" is "a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> whereby we take <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel" (Ethic. vi, 9). Now it "belongs to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> to take <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel," as stated (Ethic. vi, 9). Therefore "<em>euboulia</em>" is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> annexed to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, but rather is <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> itself.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it belongs to the higher to judge the lower. The highest <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> would therefore seem to be the one whose act is judgment. Now "<em>synesis</em>" enables us to judge well. Therefore "<em>synesis</em>" is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> annexed to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, but rather is a principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as there are various matters to pass judgment on, so are there different points on which one has to take counsel. But there is one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> referring to all matters of counsel. Therefore, in order to judge well of what has to be done, there is no need, besides "<em>synesis</em>" of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of "<em>gnome</em>."

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, Cicero (De Invent. Rhet. iii) mentions three other parts of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>; viz. "<a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> of the past, understanding of the present, and foresight of the future." Moreover, Macrobius (Super Somn. Scip. 1) mentions yet others: viz. "caution, docility," and the like. Therefore it seems that the above are not the only <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> annexed to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> stands the authority of the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vi, 9,10,11), who assigns these three <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> as being annexed to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Wherever several powers are subordinate to one another, that power is the highest which is ordained to the highest act. Now there are three acts of reason in respect of anything done by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: the first of these is counsel; the second, judgment; the third, command. The first two correspond to those acts of the speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which are inquiry and judgment, for counsel is a kind of inquiry: but the third is proper to the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, in so far as this is ordained to operation; for reason does not have to command in things that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot do. Now it is evident that in things done by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the chief act is that of command, to which all the rest are subordinate. Consequently, that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which perfects the command, viz. <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, as obtaining the highest place, has other secondary <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> annexed to it, viz. "<em>eustochia</em>," which perfects counsel; and "<em>synesis</em>" and "<em>gnome</em>," which are parts of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> in relation to judgment, and of whose distinction we shall speak further on (ad 3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">Prudence</a> makes us be of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel, not as though its immediate act consisted in being of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel, but because it perfects the latter act by means of a subordinate <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, viz. "<em>euboulia</em>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Judgment about what is to be done is directed to something further: for it may happen in some <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of action that a man's judgment is sound, while his execution is wrong. The <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> does not attain to its final complement until the reason has commanded aright in the point of what has to be done.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Judgment of anything should be based on that thing's proper principles. But inquiry does not reach to the proper principles: because, if we were in possession of these, we should need no more to inquire, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> would be already discovered. Hence only one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is directed to being of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel, wheres there are two <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> judgment: because difference is based not on common but on proper principles. Consequently, even in speculative matters, there is one science of dialectics, which inquires about all matters; whereas demonstrative <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, which pronounce judgment, differ according to their different objects. "<em>Synesis</em>" and "<em>gnome</em>" differ in respect of the different rules on which judgment is based: for "<em>synesis</em>" judges of actions according to the common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; while "<em>gnome</em>" bases its judgment on the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, in those cases where the common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> fails to apply, as we shall explain further on (II-II, 51, 4).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">Memory</a>, understanding and foresight, as also caution and docility and the like, are not <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> distinct from <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>: but are, as it were, integral parts thereof, in so far as they are all requisite for perfect <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. There are, moreover, subjective parts or <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, e.g. domestic and political economy, and the like. But the three first names are, in a fashion, <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a> parts of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>; because they are subordinate thereto, as secondary <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> to a principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: and we shall speak of them later (II-II, 48, seqq.).
