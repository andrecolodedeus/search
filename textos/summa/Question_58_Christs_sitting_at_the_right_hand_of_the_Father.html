<h1>Question 58. Christ's sitting at the right hand of the Father</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/4058.htm#article1"> Is Christ seated at the right hand of the Father?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4058.htm#article2"> Does this belong to Him according to the Divine nature?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4058.htm#article3"> Does it belong to Him according to His human nature?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4058.htm#article4"> Is it something proper to Christ?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether it is fitting that Christ should sit at the right hand of God the Father?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem unfitting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should sit at the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father. For right and left are differences of bodily position. But nothing corporeal can be applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a spirit," as we read in <a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse24">John 4:24</a>. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> does not sit at the right hand of the Father.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if anyone sits at another's right hand, then the latter is seated on his left. Consequently, if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> sits at the right hand of the Father, it follows that the Father is seated on the left of the Son; which is unseemly.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, sitting and standing savor of opposition. But <a href="../cathen/14286b.htm">Stephen</a> (<a href="../bible/act007.htm#verse55">Acts 7:55</a>) said: "Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> standing on the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> does not sit at the right hand of the Father.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written in the last chapter of Mark (16:19): "The <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, after He had spoken to them, was taken up to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and sitteth on the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The word "sitting" may have a twofold meaning; namely, "abiding" as in <a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse49">Luke 24:49</a>: "Sit [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'Stay'] you in the city": and royal or judiciary "power," as in <a href="../bible/pro020.htm#verse8">Proverbs 20:8</a>: "The king, that sitteth on the throne of judgment, scattereth away all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> with his look." Now in either sense it belongs to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to sit at the Father's right hand. First of all inasmuch as He abides <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> unchangeable in the Father's bliss, which is termed His right hand, according to <a href="../bible/psa015.htm#verse11">Psalm 15:11</a>: "At Thy right hand are delights even to the end." Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Symb. i): "'Sitteth at the right hand of the Father': To sit means to dwell, just as we say of any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: 'He sat in that country for three years': Believe, then, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> dwells so at the right hand of the Father: for He is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, and the Father's right hand is the name for His bliss." Secondly, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is said to sit at the right hand of the Father inasmuch as He reigns together with the Father, and has judiciary power from Him; just as he who sits at the king's right hand helps him in ruling and judging. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Symb. ii): "By the expression 'right hand,' understand the power which this Man, chosen of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, received, that He might come to judge, who before had come to be judged."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iv): "We do not speak of the Father's right hand as of a place, for how can a place be designated by His right hand, who Himself is beyond all place? Right and left belong to things definable by limit. But we style, as the Father's right hand, the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of the Godhead."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The argument holds good if sitting at the right hand be taken corporeally. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Symb. i): "If we accept it in a carnal sense that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> sits at the Father's right hand, then the Father will be on the left. But there"--that is, in <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">eternal bliss</a>, "it is all right hand, since no misery is there."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says in a Homily on the Ascension (Hom. xxix in Evang.), "it is the judge's place to sit, while to stand is the place of the combatant or helper. Consequently, <a href="../cathen/14286b.htm">Stephen</a> in his toil of combat saw Him standing whom He had as his helper. But Mark describes Him as seated after the <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a>, because after the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a> He will at the end be seen as judge."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether it belongs to Christ as God to sit at the right hand of the Father?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it does not belong to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to sit at the right hand of the Father. For, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the Father's right hand. But it does not appear to be the same thing to be the right hand of anyone and to sit on his right hand. Therefore, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> does not sit at the right hand of the Father.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in the last chapter of Mark (16:19) it is said that "the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a> was taken up into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and sitteth on the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." But it was not as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was taken up to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Therefore neither does He, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, sit at the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the equal of the Father and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Consequently, if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> sits as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> at the right hand of the Father, with equal reason the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> sits at the right hand of the Father and of the Son, and the Father Himself on the right hand of the Son; which no one is found to say.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iv): that "what we style as the Father's right hand, is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of the Godhead, wherein the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> before ages as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and as consubstantial with the Father."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As may be gathered from what has been said (1) three things can be understood under the expression "right hand." First of all, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> takes it, "the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Godhead": secondly, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> "the beatitude of the Father": thirdly, according to the same authority, "judiciary power." Now as we observed (1) "sitting denotes" either abiding, or royal or judiciary dignity. Hence, to sit on the right hand of the Father is nothing else than to share in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Godhead with the Father, and to possess beatitude and judiciary power, and that unchangeably and royally. But this belongs to the Son as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence it is manifest that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sits at the right hand of the Father; yet so that this preposition "at," which is a transitive one, implies merely personal distinction and order of origin, but not degree of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or dignity, for there is no such thing in the Divine Persons, as was shown in I, 42, 3,4.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is called the Father's "right hand" by appropriation, just as He is called the "Power" of the Father (<a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse24">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>). But "right hand of the Father," in its three meanings given above, is something common to the three Persons.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is exalted to Divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>; and this is signified in the aforesaid sitting; nevertheless such <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> belongs to Him as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not through any assumption, but through His origin from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In no way can it be said that the Father is seated at the right hand of the Son or of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; because the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> derive their origin from the Father, and not conversely. The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, however, can be said properly to sit at the right hand of the Father or of the Son, in the aforesaid sense, although by a kind of appropriation it is attributed to the Son, to whom equality is appropriated; thus <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. i) that "in the Father there is unity, in the Son equality, in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> the connection of unity with equality."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether it belongs to Christ as man to sit at the right hand of the Father?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it does not belong to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to sit at the right hand of the Father, because, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iv): "What we call the Father's right hand is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of the Godhead." But the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of the Godhead do not belong to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Consequently, it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not sit at the right hand of the Father.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to sit on the ruler's right hand seems to exclude subjection, because one so sitting seems in a measure to be reigning with him. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is "subject unto" the Father, as is said in <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse28">1 Corinthians 15:28</a>. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not sit at the Father's right hand.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, on <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse34">Romans 8:34</a>: "Who is at the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> adds: "that is, equal to the Father in that <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, whereby <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the Father: or, on the right hand of the Father, that is, in the mightier <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." And on <a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse3">Hebrews 1:3</a>: "sitteth on the right hand of the majesty on high," the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> adds, "that is, in equality with the Father over all things, both in place and dignity." But equality with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not belong to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; for in this respect <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself says (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse28">John 14:28</a>): "The Father is greater than I." Consequently, it appears unseemly for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to sit on the Father's right hand.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Symb. ii): "By the expression 'right hand' understand the power which this Man, chosen of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, received, that He might come as judge, who before had come to be judged."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), by the expression "right hand" is understood either the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His Godhead, or His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> beatitude, or His judicial and royal power. Now this preposition "at" signifies a kind of approach to the right hand; thus denoting something in common, and yet with a distinction, as already observed (De Symb. ii). And this can be in three ways: first of all, by something common in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and a distinction in <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; and thus <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, sits at the right hand of the Father, because He has the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> as the Father: hence these things belong to the Son <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, just as to the Father; and this is to be in equality with the Father. Secondly, according to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of union, which, on the contrary, implies distinction of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and unity of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. According to this, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and consequently sits at the Father's right hand; yet so that the expression "as" does not denote <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but unity of suppositum, as explained above (16, 10,11). Thirdly, the said approach can be understood according to <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which is more fully in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> than in all other creatures, so much so that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is more blessed than all other creatures, and possesses over all other creatures royal and judiciary power.

<p>So, then, if "as" denote <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, then <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, sits "at the Father's right hand," that is, "in equality with the Father"; but as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, He sits "at the right hand of the Father," that is, "in the Father's mightier <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> beyond all other creatures," that is to say, "in greater beatitude," and "exercising judiciary power." But if "as" denote unity of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, thus again as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, He sits at the Father's right hand "as to equality of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>," inasmuch as with the same <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> we venerate the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> with His assumed <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as was said above (Question 25, Article 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> humanity according to the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> has not the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> or <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of the Godhead, which it has nevertheless by reason of the Person with whom it is united. Hence <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> adds in the passage quoted: "In which," that is, in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Godhead, "the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> before ages, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and consubstantial with the Father, sits in His conglorified flesh; for, under one adoration the one hypostasis, together with His flesh, is <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> by every creature."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is subject to the Father, if "as" denote the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: in which respect it does not belong to Him as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to sit at the Father's right hand, by reason of their mutual equality. But it does thus belong to Him to sit at the right hand of the Father, according as is thereby denoted the excellence of beatitude and His judiciary power over every creature.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It does not belong to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to be in equality with the Father, but only to the Person who assumed it; but it does belong even to the assumed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to share in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> mightier <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, in so far as it implies exaltation above other creatures.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether it is proper to Christ to sit at the right hand of the Father?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is not proper to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to sit at the right hand of the Father, because the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse4">Ephesians 2:4-6</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> . . . hath raised us up together, and hath made us sit together in the heavenly places through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>." But to be raised up is not proper to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore for like reason neither is it proper to Him to sit "on the right hand" of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "on high" (<a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse3">Hebrews 1:3</a>).

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Symb. i): "For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to sit at the right hand of the Father, is to dwell in His beatitude." But many more share in this. Therefore it does not appear to be proper to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to sit at the right hand of the Father.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself says (<a href="../bible/rev003.htm#verse21">Apocalypse 3:21</a>): "To him that shall overcome, I will give to sit with Me in My throne: as I also have overcome, and am set down with My Father in His throne." But it is by sitting on His Father's throne that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is seated at His right hand. Therefore others who overcome likewise, sit at the Father's right hand.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the Lord says (<a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse23">Matthew 20:23</a>): "To sit on My right or left hand, is not Mine to give to you, but to them for whom it is prepared by My Father." But no purpose would be served by saying this, unless it was prepared for some. Consequently, to sit at the right hand is not proper to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse13">Hebrews 1:13</a>): "To which of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> said He at any time: Sit thou on My right hand, i.e. 'in My mightier <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>,'" or "'as my equal in the Godhead'"? [The comment is from the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>] as if to answer: "To none." But <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are higher than other creatures. Therefore, much less does it belong to anyone save Christ to sit at the Father's right hand.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is said to sit at the Father's right hand inasmuch as He is on equality with the Father in respect of His Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, while in respect of His humanity, He excels all creatures in the possession of Divine <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>. But each of these belongs exclusively to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Consequently, it belongs to no one else, <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> or <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> alone, to sit at the right hand of the Father.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is our Head, then what was bestowed on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is bestowed on us through Him. And on this account, since He is already raised up, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has, so to speak, "raised us up together with Him," still we ourselves are not raised up yet, but are to be raised up, according to <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse11">Romans 8:11</a>: "He who raised up <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> from the dead, shall quicken also your mortal bodies": and after the same manner of speech the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> adds that "He has made us to sit together with Him, in the heavenly places"; namely, for the very reason that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> our Head sits there.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Since the right hand is the Divine beatitude, then "to sit on the right hand" does not mean simply to be in beatitude, but to possess beatitude with a kind of dominative power, as a property and part of one's <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. This belongs to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> alone, and to no other creature. Yet it can be said that every <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> in bliss is placed on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> right hand; hence it is written (<a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse33">Matthew 25:33</a>): "He shall set the sheep on His right hand."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> By the "throne" is meant the judiciary power which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has from the Father: and in this sense He is said "to sit in the Father's throne." But other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> have it from Christ; and in this respect they are said "to sit on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> throne"; according to <a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse28">Matthew 19:28</a>: "You also shall sit upon twelve seats, judging the twelve tribes of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. lxv in Matth.), "that place," to wit, sitting at the right hand, "is closed not only to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but likewise to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>: for, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> declares it to be the prerogative of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, saying: 'To which of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> said He at any time: Sit on My right hand?'" <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> therefore "replied not as though some were going to sit there one day, but condescending to the supplication of the questioners; since more than others they sought this one thing alone, to stand nigh to Him." Still it can be said that the sons of Zebedee sought for higher excellence in sharing His judiciary power; hence they did not ask to sit on the Father's right hand or left, but on Christ's.
