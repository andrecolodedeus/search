<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether justice is fittingly defined as being the perpetual and constant will to render to each one his right?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that lawyers have unfittingly defined <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> as being "the perpetual and constant will to render to each one his right" [Digest. i, 1; De Just. et Jure 10. For, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. v, 1), <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> which makes a man "capable of doing what is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, and of being just in action and in <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>." Now "will" denotes a power, or also an act. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is unfittingly defined as being a will.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, rectitude of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; else if the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> were its own rectitude, it would follow that no <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is unrighteous. Yet, according to <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm</a> (De Veritate xii), <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is rectitude. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is perpetual save <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a>. If therefore <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is a perpetual will, in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone will there be <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, whatever is perpetual is constant, since it is unchangeable. Therefore it is needless in defining <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, to say that it is both "perpetual" and "constant."

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, it belongs to the sovereign to give each one his right. Therefore, if <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> gives each one his right, it follows that it is in none but the sovereign: which is absurd.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Moribus Eccl. xv) that "<a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is love serving <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone." Therefore it does not render to each one his right.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The aforesaid definition of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is fitting if understood aright. For since every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> that is the principle of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> act, a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> must needs be defined by means of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> act bearing on the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> proper to that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> consists of those things that belong to our intercourse with other men, as shall be shown further on (2). Hence the act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> in relation to its proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and object is indicated in the words, "Rendering to each one his right," since, as <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. x), "a man is said to be just because he respects the rights [jus] of others."

<p>Now in order that an act bearing upon any <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> whatever be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, it requires to be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, stable, and firm, because the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 4) that in order for an act to be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> it needs first of all to be done "knowingly," secondly to be done "by choice," and "for a due end," thirdly to be done "immovably." Now the first of these is included in the second, since "what is done through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is involuntary" (Ethic. iii, 1). Hence the definition of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> mentions first the "will," in order to show that the act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> must be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>; and mention is made afterwards of its "constancy" and "perpetuity" in order to indicate the firmness of the act.

<p>Accordingly, this is a complete definition of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; save that the act is mentioned instead of the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, which takes its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from that act, because <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> implies relation to act. And if anyone would reduce it to the proper form of a definition, he might say that "<a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> whereby a man renders to each one his due by a constant and perpetual will": and this is about the same definition as that given by the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. v, 5) who says that "<a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> whereby a man is said to be capable of doing just actions in accordance with his choice."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Will here denotes the act, not the power: and it is customary among writers to define <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> by their acts: thus <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. in Joan. xl) that "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what one sees not."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Justice is the same as rectitude, not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> but <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causally</a>; for it is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> which rectifies the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The will may be called perpetual in two ways. First on the part of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will's</a> act which endures for ever, and thus <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will alone is perpetual. Secondly on the part of the subject, because, to wit, a man wills to do a certain thing always. and this is a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. For it does not satisfy the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> that one wish to observe <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> in some particular <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> for the time being, because one could scarcely find a man willing to act <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> in every case; and it is requisite that one should have the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to observe <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> at all times and in all cases.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Since "perpetual" does not imply perpetuity of the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, it is not superfluous to add "constant": for while the "perpetual will" denotes the purpose of observing <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> always, "constant" signifies a firm perseverance in this purpose.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> A judge renders to each one what belongs to him, by way of command and direction, because a judge is the "personification of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>," and "the sovereign is its guardian" (Ethic. v, 4). On the other hand, the subjects render to each one what belongs to him, by way of execution.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> Just as love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> includes love of our neighbor, as stated above (Question 25, Article 1), so too the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> includes rendering to each one his due.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether justice is always towards one another?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is not always towards another. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse22">Romans 3:22</a>) that "the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> does not concern the dealings of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with another. Neither therefore does <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Moribus Eccl. xv), "it belongs to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should direct to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> his authority over the things that are subject to him." Now the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is subject to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, according to <a href="../bible/gen004.htm#verse7">Genesis 4:7</a>, where it is written: "The <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> thereof," viz. of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, "shall be under thee, and thou shalt have dominion over it." Therefore it belongs to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to have dominion over one's own <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>: so that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is towards oneself.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. But nothing else is co-<a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> towards another.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> dealings with himself need to be rectified no less than his dealings with another. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> dealings are rectified by <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, according to <a href="../bible/pro011.htm#verse5">Proverbs 11:5</a>, "The <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of the upright shall make his way prosperous." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is about our dealings not only with others, but also with ourselves.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Tully says (De Officiis i, 7) that "the object of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is to keep men together in society and mutual intercourse." Now this implies relationship of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to another. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is concerned only about our dealings with others.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 57, Article 1) since <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> by its name implies equality, it denotes <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> relation to another, for a thing is equal, not to itself, but to another. And forasmuch as it belongs to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to rectify <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, as stated above (57, 1; I-II, 113, 1) this otherness which <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> demands must needs be between beings capable of action. Now actions belong to supposits [Cf. I, 29, 2] and wholes and, properly speaking, not to parts and forms or powers, for we do not say properly that the hand strikes, but a man with his hand, nor that heat makes a thing hot, but fire by heat, although such expressions may be employed metaphorically. Hence, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> properly speaking demands a distinction of supposits, and consequently is only in one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> towards another. Nevertheless in one and the same <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> we may speak metaphorically of his various principles of action such as the reason, the irascible, and the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>, as though they were so many agents: so that metaphorically in one and the same <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> there is said to be <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> in so far as the reason commands the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>, and these obey reason; and in general in so far as to each part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is ascribed what is becoming to it. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. v, 11) calls this "metaphorical <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> which <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> works in us, is that whereby the ungodly is justified it consists in the due coordination of the parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as stated above (I-II, 113, 1) where we were treating of the justification of the ungodly. Now this belongs to metaphorical <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which may be found even in a man who lives all by himself.

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the Second Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> in respect of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> will and purpose (and it is chiefly in this that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> consists); although it is not <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> as regards its effect, since nothing is co-<a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man's</a> dealings with himself are sufficiently rectified by the rectification of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> by the other moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. But his dealings with others need a special rectification, not only in relation to the agent, but also in relation to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to whom they are directed. Hence about such dealings there is a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and this is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether justice is a virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse10">Luke 17:10</a>): "When you shall have done all these things that are commanded you, say: We are unprofitable servants; we have done that which we ought to do." Now it is not unprofitable to do a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>: for <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Officiis ii, 6): "We look to a profit that is estimated not by pecuniary gain but by the acquisition of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">godliness</a>." Therefore to do what one ought to do, is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>. And yet it is an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which is done of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, is not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>. But to render to a man what belongs to him, as <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> requires, is of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. Therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>. Yet it is by <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> actions that we gain <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is about matters of action. Now those things which are wrought externally are not things concerning behavior but concerning handicraft, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. ix) [<a href="../cathen/04782b.htm">Didot</a> ed., viii, 8]. Therefore since it belongs to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to produce externally a <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> that is just in itself, it seems that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is not a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. ii, 49) that "the entire structure of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works is built on four <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>," viz. <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is one "which renders a <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> himself <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" [Ethic. ii, 6, and this can be applied to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. For a man's act is made <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> through attaining the rule of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, which is the rule whereby <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> are regulated. Hence, since <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> regulates <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> operations, it is evident that it renders <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> operations <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and, as Tully declares (De Officiis i, 7), <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> men are so called chiefly from their <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, wherefore, as he says again (De Officiis i, 7) "the luster of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> appears above all in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> When a man does what he ought, he brings no gain to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to whom he does what he ought, but only abstains from doing him a harm. He does however profit himself, in so far as he does what he ought, spontaneously and readily, and this is to act virtuously. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/wis008.htm#verse7">Wisdom 8:7</a>) that Divine wisdom "teacheth <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, which are such things as men (i.e. <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> men) can have nothing more profitable in life."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">Necessity</a> is twofold. One arises from "constraint," and this removes <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, since it runs counter to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. The other arises from the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of a "command," or from the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of obtaining an end, when, to wit, a man is unable to achieve the end of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> without doing some particular thing. The latter <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> does not remove <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, when a man does <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> that which is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in this way. It does however exclude the credit of supererogation, according to <a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse16">1 Corinthians 9:16</a>, "If I preach the Gospel, it is no <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to me, for a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> lieth upon me."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Justice is concerned about external things, not by making them, which pertains to art, but by using them in our dealings with other men.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether justice is in the will as its subject?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is not in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as its subject. For <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is sometimes called <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, but in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is not in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as its subject.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is about our dealings with others. Now it belongs to the reason to direct one thing in relation to another. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is not in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as its subject but in the reason.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is not an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since it is not directed to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; wherefore it follows that it is a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now the subject of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is the faculty which is "rational by participation," viz. the irascible and the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> declares (Ethic. i, 13). Therefore <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is not in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as its subject, but in the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm</a> says (De Verit. xii) that "<a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is rectitude of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> observed for its own sake."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The subject of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is the power whose act that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> aims at rectifying. Now <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> does not aim at directing an act of the cognitive power, for we are not said to be just through <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> something aright. Hence the subject of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> or reason which is a cognitive power. But since we are said to be just through doing something aright, and because the proximate principle of action is the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> must needs be in some <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power as its subject.

<p>Now the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is twofold; namely, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> which is in the reason and the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> which follows on sensitive apprehension, and is divided into the irascible and the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>, as stated in I, 81, 2. Again the act of rendering his due to each <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot proceed from the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, because sensitive apprehension does not go so far as to be able to consider the relation of one thing to another; but this is proper to the reason. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> cannot be in the irascible or <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> as its subject, but only in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. v, 1) defines <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> by an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as may be seen above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Since the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the rational <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, when the rectitude of the reason which is called <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is imprinted on the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> on account of its nighness to the reason, this imprint retains the name of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; and hence it is that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> sometimes goes by the name of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is borne towards its object consequently on the apprehension of reason: wherefore, since the reason directs one thing in relation to another, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> can will one thing in relation to another, and this belongs to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Not only the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> parts are "rational by participation," but the entire "<a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a>" faculty, as stated in Ethic. i, 13, because all <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is subject to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is contained in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> faculty, wherefore it can be the subject of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether justice is a general virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is not a general <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is specified with the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, according to <a href="../bible/wis008.htm#verse7">Wisdom 8:7</a>, "She teacheth <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>." Now the "general" is not specified or reckoned together with the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> contained under the same "general." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is not a general <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is accounted a cardinal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, so are <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. Now neither <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> nor <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is reckoned to be a general <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore neither should <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> in any way be reckoned a general <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is always towards others, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). But a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed against one's neighbor cannot be a general <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because it is condivided with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed against oneself. Therefore neither is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> a general <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. v, 1) that "<a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Justice, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>) directs <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in his relations with other men. Now this may happen in two ways: first as regards his relation with <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, secondly as regards his relations with others in general, in so far as a man who serves a community, serves all those who are included in that community. Accordingly <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> in its proper acceptation can be directed to another in both these senses. Now it is evident that all who are included in a community, stand in relation to that community as parts to a whole; while a part, as such, belongs to a whole, so that whatever is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of a part can be directed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the whole. It follows therefore that the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, whether such <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> direct <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in relation to himself, or in relation to certain other <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, is referable to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, to which <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> directs: so that all acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> can pertain to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, in so far as it directs <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. It is in this sense that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is called a general <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. And since it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to direct to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as stated above (I-II, 90, 2), it follows that the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> which is in this way styled general, is called "legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>," because thereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is in harmony with the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> which directs the acts of all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Justice is specified or enumerated with the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, not as a general but as a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as we shall state further on (A07,12).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Temperance and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> are in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, viz. in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> and irascible. Now these powers are <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> of certain particular goods, even as the senses are cognitive of particulars. On the other hand <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> as its subject, which can have the universal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as its object, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> whereof belongs to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> can be a general <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> rather than <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> or <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Things referable to oneself are referable to another, especially in regard to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Wherefore legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, in so far as it directs to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, may be called a general <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: and in like manner <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> may be called a general <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; hence it is written (<a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse4">1 John 3:4</a>) that all "<a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>."

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether justice, as a general virtue, is essentially the same as all virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as a general <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> the same as all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. v, 1) that "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> are the same as all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but differ in their mode of being." Now things that differ merely in their mode of being or <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> do not differ <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> the same as every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> the same as all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a part of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. v. 1) "is not a part but the whole of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>." Therefore the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> the same as all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> does not change through that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> directing its act to some higher end even as the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> remains <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> the same even though its act be directed to a Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now it belongs to legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> that the acts of all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are directed to a higher end, namely the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the multitude, which transcends the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of one single <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. Therefore it seems that legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of a part can be directed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the whole, so that if it be not thus directed it would seem without use or purpose. But that which is in accordance with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> cannot be so. Therefore it seems that there can be no act of any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, that does not belong to general <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which directs to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and so it seems that general <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> the same as all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. v, 1) that "many are able to be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> in matters affecting themselves, but are unable to be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> in matters relating to others," and (Polit. iii, 2) that "the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not strictly the same as the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> citizen." Now the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> citizen is general <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, whereby a man Is directed to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore general <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is not the same as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in general, and it is possible to have one without the other.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing is said to be "general" in two ways. First, by "predication": thus "animal" is general in relation to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and horse and the like: and in this sense that which is general must needs be <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> the same as the things in relation to which it is general, for the reason that the genus belongs to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and forms part of its definition. Secondly a thing is said to be general "virtually"; thus a universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is general in relation to all its effects, the sun, for instance, in relation to all bodies that are illumined, or transmuted by its power; and in this sense there is no need for that which is "general" to be <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> the same as those things in relation to which it is general, since <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and effect are not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> the same. Now it is in the latter sense that, according to what has been said (5), legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is said to be a general <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, in as much, to wit, as it directs the acts of the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> to its own end, and this is to move all the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> by its command; for just as <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> may be called a general <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in so far as it directs the acts of all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> to the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, so too is legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, in so far as it directs the acts of all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Accordingly, just as <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> which regards the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as its proper object, is a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in respect of its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, so too legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in respect of its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, in so far as it regards the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as its proper object. And thus it is in the sovereign principally and by way of a mastercraft, while it is secondarily and administratively in his subjects.

<p>However the name of legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> can be given to every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, in so far as every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is directed to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by the aforesaid legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which though special <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> is nevertheless virtually general. Speaking in this way, legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> the same as all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but differs therefrom <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a>: and it is in this sense that the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> speaks.

<p>Wherefore the Replies to the First and Second Objections are manifest.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument again takes legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> for the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> commanded by legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> strictly speaking directs its act to that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue's</a> proper end: that it should happen to be directed to a further end either always or sometimes, does not belong to that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> considered strictly, for it needs some higher <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to direct it to that end. Consequently there must be one supreme <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> distinct from every other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which directs all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether there is a particular besides a general justice?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is not a particular besides a general <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. For there is nothing superfluous in the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as neither is there in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now general <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> directs <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> sufficiently in all his relations with other men. Therefore there is no need for a particular <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> does not vary according to "one" and "many." But legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> directs one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to another in matters relating to the multitude, as shown above (A5,6). Therefore there is not another <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> directing one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to another in matters relating to the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, between the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> and the general public stands the household community. Consequently, if in addition to general <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> there is a particular <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> corresponding to the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, for the same reason there should be a domestic <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> directing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of a household: and yet this is not the case. Therefore neither should there be a particular besides a legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> in his commentary on <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse6">Matthew 5:6</a>, "Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>," says (Hom. xv in Matth.): "By <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> He signifies either the general <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, or the particular <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which is opposed to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#6">Article 6</a>), legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> the same as every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and besides legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> which directs <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> immediately to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, there is a need for other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> to direct him immediately in matters relating to particular goods: and these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> may be relative to himself or to another <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Accordingly, just as in addition to legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> there is a need for particular <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> to direct <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in relation to himself, such as <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, so too besides legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> there is need for particular <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to direct <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in his relations to other <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> does indeed direct <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> sufficiently in his relations towards others. As regards the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> it does so immediately, but as to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, it does so mediately. Wherefore there is need for particular <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to direct a man immediately to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of another <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the realm and the particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> differ not only in respect of the "many" and the "few," but also under a formal aspect. For the aspect of the "common" <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> differs from the aspect of the "<a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>" <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, even as the aspect of "whole" differs from that of "part." Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Polit. i, 1) that "they are wrong who maintain that the State and the home and the like differ only as many and few and not specifically."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The household community, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Polit. i, 2), differs in respect of a threefold fellowship; namely "of husband and wife, father and son, master and <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a>," in each of which one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is, as it were, part of the other. Wherefore between such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> there is not <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> simply, but a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, viz. "domestic" <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as stated in Ethic. v, 6.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether particular justice has a special matter?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that particular <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> has no special <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Because a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse14">Genesis 2:14</a>, "The fourth river is Euphrates," says: "Euphrates signifies 'fruitful'; nor is it stated through what country it flows, because <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> pertains to all the parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>." Now this would not be the case, if <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> had a special <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, since every special <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> belongs to a special power. Therefore particular <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> has no special <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. lxxxiii, qu. 61) that "the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has four <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> whereby, in this life, it lives spiritually, viz. <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>;" and he says that "the fourth is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which pervades all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>." Therefore particular <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which is one of the four cardinal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, has no special <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> directs <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> sufficiently in matters relating to others. Now a man can be directed to others in all matters relating to this life. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is general and not special.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> reckons (Ethic. v, 2) particular <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to be specially about those things which belong to social life.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Whatever can be rectified by reason is the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, for this is defined in reference to right reason, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. ii, 6). Now the reason can rectify not only the internal <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but also external actions, and also those external things of which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can make use. And yet it is in respect of external actions and external things by means of which men can communicate with one another, that the relation of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to another is to be considered; whereas it is in respect of internal <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> that we consider <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> rectitude in himself. Consequently, since <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is directed to others, it is not about the entire <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but only about external actions and things, under a certain special aspect of the object, in so far as one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is related to another through them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> belongs <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> to one part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, where it resides as in its subject; and this is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> which moves by its command all the other parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and accordingly <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> belongs to all the parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, not directly but by a kind of diffusion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above (I-II, 61, 3,4), the cardinal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> may be taken in two ways: first as special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, each having a determinate <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; secondly, as certain general modes of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. On this latter sense <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> speaks in the passage quoted: for he says that "<a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of what we should seek and avoid, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is the curb on the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> for fleeting pleasures, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is strength of mind in bearing with passing trials, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and our neighbor which pervades the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, that is to say, is the common principle of the entire order between one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and another."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> internal <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> which are a part of moral <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, are not in themselves directed to another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, which belongs to the specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; yet their effects, i.e. external actions, are capable of being directed to another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Consequently it does not follow that the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is general.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether justice is about the passions?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is about the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 3) that "moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is about pleasure and pain." Now pleasure or delight, and pain are <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, as stated above [I-II, 23, 4; I-II, 31, 1; I-II, 35, 1] when we were treating of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, being a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, is about the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is the means of rectifying a man's operations in relation to another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Now such like operations cannot be rectified unless the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> be rectified, because it is owing to disorder of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> that there is disorder in the aforesaid operations: thus sexual <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> leads to <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, and overmuch love of money leads to <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> must needs be about the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, even as particular <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is towards another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> so is legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Now legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is about the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, else it would not extend to all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, some of which are evidently about the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is about the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. v, 1) that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is about operations.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> answer to this question may be gathered from a twofold source. First from the subject of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, i.e. from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, whose movements or acts are not <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, as stated above (I-II, 22, 3; I-II, 59, 4), for it is only the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> whose movements are called <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is not about the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, as are <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, which are in the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> parts. Secondly, on he part of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, because <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is about <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> relations with another, and we are not directed immediately to another by the internal <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is not about the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Not every moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is about pleasure and pain as its proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, since <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is about fear and daring: but every moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is directed to pleasure and pain, as to ends to be acquired, for, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 11), "pleasure and pain are the principal end in respect of which we say that this is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and that a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>": and in this way too they belong to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, since "a man is not just unless he rejoice in just actions" (Ethic. i, 8).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> External operations are as it were between external things, which are their <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and internal <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, which are their origin. Now it happens sometimes that there is a defect in one of these, without there being a defect in the other. Thus a man may steal another's property, not through the desire to have the thing, but through the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to hurt the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; or vice versa, a man may covet another's property without wishing to steal it. Accordingly the directing of operations in so far as they tend towards external things, belongs to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but in so far as they arise from the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, it belongs to the other moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which are about the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> hinders <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> of another's property, in so far as stealing is contrary to the, equality that should be maintained in external things, while liberality hinders it as resulting from an immoderate desire for <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>. Since, however, external operations take their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, not from the internal <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> but from external things as being their objects, it follows that, external operations are <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> rather than of the other moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is the end of each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> member of a community, just as the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the whole is the end of each part. On the other hand the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of one <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> is not the end of another <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>: wherefore legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> which is directed to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, is more capable of extending to the internal <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is disposed in some way or other in himself, than particular <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> which is directed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of another <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>: although legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> extends chiefly to other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in the point of their external operations, in so far, to wit, as "the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> commands us to perform the actions of a courageous <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> . . . the actions of a temperate <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> . . . and the actions of a gentle <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>" (Ethic. v, 5).

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether the mean of justice is the real mean?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the mean of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is not the real mean. For the generic <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> remains entire in each <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Now moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is defined (Ethic. ii, 6) to be "an elective <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> which observes the mean fixed, in our regard, by reason." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> observes the rational and not the real mean.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in things that are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> simply, there is neither excess nor defect, and consequently neither is there a mean; as is clearly the case with the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, according to Ethic. ii, 6. Now <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is about things that are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> simply, as stated in Ethic. v. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> does not observe the real mean.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the reason why the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are said to observe the rational and not the real mean, is because in their case the mean varies according to different <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, since what is too much for one is too little for another (Ethic. ii, 6). Now this is also the case in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: for one who strikes a prince does not receive the same punishment as one who strikes a private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> also observes, not the real, but the rational mean.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 6; v, 4) that the mean of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is to be taken according to "arithmetical" proportion, so that it is the real mean.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (09; I-II, 59, 4), the other moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are chiefly concerned with the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, the regulation of which is gauged entirely by a comparison with the very <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who is the subject of those <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, in so far as his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and desire are vested with their various due circumstances. Hence the mean in such like <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> is measured not by the proportion of one thing to another, but merely by comparison with the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> himself, so that with them the mean is only that which is fixed by reason in our regard.

<p>On the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is external operation, in so far as an operation or the thing used in that operation is duly proportionate to another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, wherefore the mean of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> consists in a certain proportion of equality between the external thing and the external <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Now equality is the real mean between greater and less, as stated in Metaph. x [<a href="../cathen/04782b.htm">Didot</a> ed., ix, 5; Cf. Ethic. v, 4: wherefore <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> observes the real mean.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This real mean is also the rational mean, wherefore <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> satisfies the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> We may speak of a thing being <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> simply in two ways. First a thing may be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in every way: thus the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and there is neither mean nor extremes in things that are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> simply in this sense. Secondly a thing is said to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> simply through being <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> absolutely i.e. in its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, although it may become <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> through being abused. Such are <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> and honors; and in the like it is possible to find excess, deficiency and mean, as regards men who can use them well or ill: and it is in this sense that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is about things that are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> simply.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The injury inflicted bears a different proportion to a prince from that which it bears to a private <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>: wherefore each injury requires to be equalized by vengeance in a different way: and this implies a real and not merely a rational diversity.

<h2 id="article11">Article 11. Whether the act of justice is to render to each one his own?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is not to render to each one his own. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. xiv, 9) ascribes to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> the act of succoring the needy. Now in succoring the needy we give them what is not theirs but ours. Therefore the act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> does not consist in rendering to each one his own.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, Tully says (De Offic. i, 7) that "beneficence which we may call kindness or liberality, belongs to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>." Now it pertains to liberality to give to another of one's own, not of what is his. Therefore the act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> does not consist in rendering to each one his own.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it belongs to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> not only to distribute things duly, but also to repress injurious actions, such as <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> and so forth. But the rendering to each one of what is his seems to belong solely to the distribution of things. Therefore the act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is not sufficiently described by saying that it consists in rendering to each one his own.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Offic. i, 24): "It is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> that renders to each one what is his, and claims not another's property; it disregards its own profit in order to preserve the common equity."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (A8,10), the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is an external operation in so far as either it or the thing we use by it is made proportionate to some other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to whom we are related by <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Now each <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> own is that which is due to him according to equality of proportion. Therefore the proper act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is nothing else than to render to each one his own.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is a cardinal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, other secondary <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, such as mercy, liberality and the like are connected with it, as we shall state further on (80, 1). Wherefore to succor the needy, which belongs to mercy or pity, and to be liberally beneficent, which pertains to liberality, are by a kind of reduction ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> as to their principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the Second Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. v, 4), in matters of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, the name of "profit" is extended to whatever is excessive, and whatever is deficient is called "loss." The reason for this is that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is first of all and more commonly exercised in <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> interchanges of things, such as buying and selling, wherein those expressions are properly employed; and yet they are transferred to all other matters of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. The same applies to the rendering to each one of what is his own.

<h2 id="article12">Article 12. Whether justice stands foremost among all moral virtues?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> does not stand foremost among all the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Because it belongs to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to render to each one what is his, whereas it belongs to liberality to give of one's own, and this is more <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>. Therefore liberality is a greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, nothing is adorned by a less excellent thing than itself. Now magnanimity is the ornament both of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and of all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, according to Ethic. iv, 3. Therefore magnanimity is more excellent than <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is about that which is "difficult" and "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," as stated in Ethic. ii, 3. But <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is about more difficult things than <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is, since it is about dangers of death, according to Ethic. iii, 6. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is more excellent than <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Tully says (De Offic. i, 7): "Justice is the most resplendent of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and gives its name to a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> If we speak of legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, it is evident that it stands foremost among all the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, for as much as the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> transcends the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. On this sense the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> declares (Ethic. v, 1) that "the most excellent of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> would seem to be <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> than either the evening or the morning star." But, even if we speak of particular <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, it excels the other moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> for two reasons. The first reason may be taken from the subject, because <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is in the more excellent part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, viz. the rational <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> or will, whereas the other moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, whereunto appertain the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> which are the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the other moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. The second reason is taken from the object, because the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are commendable in respect of the sole <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> himself, whereas <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is praiseworthy in respect of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> being well disposed towards another, so that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is somewhat the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, as stated in Ethic. v, 1. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. i, 9): "The greatest <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> must needs be those which are most profitable to other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, because <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a faculty of doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to others. For this reason the greatest honors are accorded the brave and the just, since bravery is useful to others in warfare, and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is useful to others both in warfare and in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> of peace."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although the liberal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> gives of his own, yet he does so in so far as he takes into consideration the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of his own <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, while the just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> gives to another what is his, through consideration of the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Moreover <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is observed towards all, whereas liberality cannot extend to all. Again liberality which gives of a man's own is based on <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, whereby one renders to each <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> what is his.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When magnanimity is added to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> it increases the latter's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>; and yet without <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> it would not even be a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is about the most difficult things, it is not about the best, for it is only useful in warfare, whereas <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is useful both in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and in peace, as stated above.
