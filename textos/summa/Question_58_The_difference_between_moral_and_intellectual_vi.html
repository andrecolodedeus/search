<h1>Question 58. The difference between moral and intellectual virtues</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2058.htm#article1"> Is every virtue a moral virtue?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2058.htm#article2"> Does moral virtue differ from intellectual virtue?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2058.htm#article3"> Is virtue adequately divided into moral and intellectual virtue?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2058.htm#article4"> Can there be moral without intellectual virtue?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2058.htm#article5"> On the other hand, can there be intellectual without moral virtue?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether every virtue is a moral virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Because moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is so called from the <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> "mos," i.e. custom. Now, we can accustom ourselves to the acts of all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Therefore every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 6) that moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is "a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of choosing the rational mean." But every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of choosing: since the acts of any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> can be done from choice. And, moreover, every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> consists in following the rational mean in some way, as we shall explain further on (64, A1,2,3). Therefore every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, Cicero says (De Invent. Rhet. ii) that "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> like a second <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, in accord with reason." But since every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is directed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it must be in accord with reason: since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> "consists in that which agrees with his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>," as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> states (Div. Nom. iv). Therefore every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. i, 13): "When we speak of a man's morals, we do not say that he is wise or <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a>, but that he is gentle or sober." Accordingly, then, wisdom and understanding are not moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: and yet they are <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as stated above (Question 57, Article 2). Therefore not every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In order to answer this question clearly, we must consider the meaning of the <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> word "mos"; for thus we shall be able to discover what a "moral" <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is. Now "mos" has a twofold meaning. For sometimes it means custom, in which sense we read (<a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse1">Acts 15:1</a>): "Except you be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> after the manner (morem) of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, you cannot be saved." Sometimes it means a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> or quasi-<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination to do some particular action, in which sense the word is applied to dumb animals. Thus we read (<a href="../bible/2ma001.htm#verse2">2 Maccabees 1:2</a>) that "rushing violently upon the enemy, like lions [Leonum more, i.e. as lions are in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of doing], they slew them": and the word is used in the same sense in <a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse7">Psalm 67:7</a>, where we read: "Who maketh men of one manner [moris] to dwell in a house." For both these significations there is but one word in <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a>; but in the Greek there is a distinct word for each, for the word "ethos" is written sometimes with a long, and sometimes a short "e".

<p>Now "moral" <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is so called from "mos" in the sense of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> or quasi-<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination to do some particular action. And the other meaning of "mos," i.e. "custom," is akin to this: because custom becomes a second <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and produces an inclination similar to a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> one. But it is evident that inclination to an action belongs properly to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, whose function it is to move all the powers to their acts, as explained above (Question 9, Article 1). Therefore not every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but only those that are in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> faculty.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument takes "mos" in the sense of "custom."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Every act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> can be done from choice: but no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> makes us choose aright, save that which is in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: for it has been stated above that choice is an act of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> faculty (13, 1). Wherefore a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of choosing, i.e. a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> which is the principle whereby we choose, is that <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> alone which perfects the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> faculty: although the acts of other <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> also may be a matter of choice.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> "Nature is the principle of movement" (Phys. ii, text. 3). Now to move the faculties to act is the proper function of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power. Consequently to become as a second <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> by consenting to the reason, is proper to those <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which are in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> faculty.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether moral virtue differs from intellectual virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> does not differ from <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei iv, 21) "that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is the art of right conduct." But art is an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore moral and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> do not differ.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, some authors put science in the definition of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: thus some define perseverance as a "science or <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> regarding those things to which we should hold or not hold"; and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> as "a science which makes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be faithful and to do his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Now science is an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> should not be distinguished from <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Soliloq. i, 6) that "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is the rectitude and perfection of reason." But this belongs to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as stated in Ethic. vi, 13. Therefore moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> does not differ from <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, a thing does not differ from that which is included in its definition. But <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is included in the definition of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 6) that "moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of choosing the mean appointed by reason as a <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would appoint it." Now this right reason that fixes the mean of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, belongs to an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated in Ethic. vi, 13. Therefore moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> does not differ from <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is stated in Ethic. i, 13 that "there are two kinds of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: some we call <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>; some moral."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason</a> is the first principle of all <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>; and whatever other principles of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> may be found, they obey reason somewhat, but in various ways. For some obey reason blindly and without any contradiction whatever: such are the limbs of the body, provided they be in a healthy <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, for as soon as reason commands, the hand or the foot proceeds to action. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Polit. i, 3) that "the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> rules the body like a despot," i.e. as a master rules his <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a>, who has no right to rebel. Accordingly some held that all the active principles in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> are subordinate to reason in this way. If this were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to act well it would suffice that his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> be perfect. Consequently, since <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> perfecting <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in view of his doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> actions, it would follow that it is only in the reason, so that there would be none but <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. This was the opinion of <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a>, who said "every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a kind of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>," as stated in Ethic. vi, 13. Hence he maintained that as long as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is in possession of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, he cannot <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and that every one who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, does so through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>.

<p>Now this is based on a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> supposition. Because the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> faculty obeys the reason, not blindly, but with a certain power of opposition; wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Polit. i, 3) that "reason commands the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> faculty by a politic power," whereby a man rules over subjects that are free, having a certain right of opposition. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says on <a href="../bible/psa118.htm">Psalm 118</a> (Serm. 8) that "sometimes we understand [what is right] while desire is slow, or follows not at all," in so far as the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> or <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> faculty <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> to be impeded in some particular action. And in this way, there is some <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the saying of <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> that so long as a man is in possession of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> he does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: provided, however, that this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is made to include the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> in this <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> act of choice.

<p>Accordingly for a man to do a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, it is requisite not only that his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> be well disposed by means of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; but also that his <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> be well disposed by means of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. And so moral differs from <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, even as the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> differs from the reason. Hence just as the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is the principle of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, in so far as it partakes of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, so are moral <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> to be considered <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in so far as they are in conformity with reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> usually applies the term "art" to any form of right reason; in which sense art includes <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> which is the right reason about things to be done, even as art is the right reason about things to be made. Accordingly, when he says that "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is the art of right conduct," this applies to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>; but to other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, by participation, for as much as they are directed by <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> All such definitions, by whomsoever given, were based on the Socratic theory, and should be explained according to what we have said about art (ad 1).

<p>The same applies to the Third Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Right reason which is in accord with <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is included in the definition of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, not as part of its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, but as something belonging by way of participation to all the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, in so far as they are all under the direction of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether virtue is adequately divided into moral and intellectual?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not adequately divided into moral and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>. For <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> seems to be a mean between moral and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since it is reckoned among the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> (Ethic. vi, 3,5); and again is placed by all among the four cardinal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, which are moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as we shall show further on (61, 1). Therefore <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not adequately divided into <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and moral, as though there were no mean between them.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, contingency, perseverance, and patience are not reckoned to be <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Yet neither are they moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; since they do not reduce the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> to a mean, and are consistent with an abundance of passion. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not adequately divided into <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and moral.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> are <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Yet they are not <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: for there are only five of these, viz. science, wisdom, understanding, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and art, as stated above (57, A2,3,5). Neither are they moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; since they are not about the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, which are the chief concern of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not adequately divided into <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and moral.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 1) that "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is twofold, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and moral."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> perfecting <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in view of his doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. Now, in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> there are but two principles of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions, viz. the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> or reason and the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>: for these are the two principles of movement in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as stated in De Anima iii, text. 48. Consequently every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> must needs be a perfection of one of these principles. Accordingly if it perfects <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> speculative or practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in order that his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> may be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it will be an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: whereas if it perfects his <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, it will be a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. It follows therefore that every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is either <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> or moral.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">Prudence</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But considered on the part of its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, it has something in common with the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: for it is right reason about things to be done, as stated above (Question 57, Article 4). It is in this sense that it is reckoned with the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Contingency and perseverance are not perfections of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. This is clear from the fact that <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> abound in the continent and persevering <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, which would not be the case if his sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> were perfected by a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> making it conformable to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Contingency and perseverance are, however, perfections of the rational faculty, and withstand the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> lest reason be led astray. But they fall short of being <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: since <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which makes reason to hold itself well in respect of moral matters, presupposes a right <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> of the end, so that it may hold itself aright in respect of principles, i.e. the ends, on which it builds its argument: and this is wanting in the continent and persevering <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Nor again can an action proceeding from two principles be perfect, unless each principle be perfected by the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> corresponding to that operation: thus, however perfect be the principal agent employing an instrument, it will produce an imperfect effect, if the instrument be not well disposed also. Hence if the sensitive faculty, which is moved by the rational faculty, is not perfect; however perfect the rational faculty may be, the resulting action will be imperfect: and consequently the principle of that action will not be a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. And for this reason, contingency, desisting from pleasures, and perseverance in the midst of pains, are not <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, but something less than a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> maintains (Ethic. vii, 1,9).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, hope, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> are superhuman <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: for they are <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as sharing in the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether there can be moral without intellectual virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that moral can be without <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Because moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as Cicero says (De Invent. Rhet. ii) is "a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> like a second <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in accord with reason." Now though <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> may be in accord with some sovereign reason that moves it, there is no need for that reason to be united to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in the same subject, as is evident of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things devoid of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Therefore in a man there may be a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> like a second <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, inclining him to consent to his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, without his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> being perfected by an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, by means of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> obtains perfect use of reason. But it happens at times that men are <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> and acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, without being vigorous in the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Therefore it seems that moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> can be without <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> makes us inclined to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works. But some, without depending on the judgment of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, have a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works. Therefore moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> can be without <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxii) that "the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, unless we do prudently what we desire to do, cannot be real <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>." But <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated above (Question 57, Article 5). Therefore moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> cannot be without <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> can be without some of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, viz. wisdom, science, and art; but not without understanding and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> cannot be without <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, because it is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of choosing, i.e. making us choose well. Now in order that a choice be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, two things are required. First, that the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> be directed to a due end; and this is done by moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which inclines the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> faculty to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that is in accord with reason, which is a due end. Secondly, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> take rightly those things which have reference to the end: and this he cannot do unless his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> counsel, judge and command aright, which is the function of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> annexed to it, as stated above (57, A5,6). Wherefore there can be no moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> without <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>: and consequently neither can there be without understanding. For it is by the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of understanding that we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> self-evident principles both in speculative and in practical matters. Consequently just as right reason in speculative matters, in so far as it proceeds from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> principles, presupposes the understanding of those principles, so also does <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, which is the right reason about things to be done.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The inclination of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in things devoid of reason is without choice: wherefore such an inclination does not of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> require reason. But the inclination of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is with choice: and consequently in order that it may be perfect it requires that reason be perfected by <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> without having full use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> as to everything, provided he have it with regard to those things which have to be done virtuously. In this way all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> men have full use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Hence those who seem to be simple, through lack of worldly cunning, may possibly be <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse16">Matthew 10:16</a>: "Be ye therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'wise'] as serpents, and simple as doves."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination to a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a kind of beginning of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but is not perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For the stronger this inclination is, the more perilous may it <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> to be, unless it be accompanied by right reason, which rectifies the choice of fitting means towards the due end. Thus if a running horse be blind, the faster it runs the more heavily will it fall, and the more grievously will it be hurt. And consequently, although moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> be not right reason, as <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> held, yet not only is it "according to right reason," in so far as it inclines <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to that which is, according to right reason, as the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a> maintained [Cf. <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, Meno xli.]; but also it needs to be "joined with right reason," as <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> declares (Ethic. vi, 13).

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether there can be intellectual without moral virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there can be <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> without moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Because perfection of what precedes does not depend on the perfection of what follows. Now reason precedes and moves the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which is a perfection of the reason, does not depend on moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which is a perfection of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> faculty; and can be without it.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, morals are the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, even as things makeable are the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of art. Now art can be without its proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as a smith without iron. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> can be without the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, although of all the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, it seems most akin to the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is "a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> whereby we are of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel" (Ethic. vi, 9). Now many are of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel without having the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> can be without a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> To wish to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is directly opposed to moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and yet it is not opposed to anything that can be without moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now it is contrary to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> "to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> willingly" (Ethic. vi, 5). Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> cannot be without moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Other <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> can, but <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> cannot, be without moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. The reason for this is that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is the right reason about things to be done (and this, not merely in general, but also in particular); about which things actions are. Now right reason demands principles from which reason proceeds to argue. And when reason argues about particular cases, it needs not only universal but also particular principles. As to universal principles of action, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is rightly disposed by the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> understanding of principles, whereby he understands that he should do no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; or again by some practical science. But this is not enough in order that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may reason aright about particular cases. For it happens sometimes that the aforesaid universal principle, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by means of understanding or science, is destroyed in a particular case by a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>: thus to one who is swayed by <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, when he is overcome thereby, the object of his desire seems <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, although it is opposed to the universal judgment of his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Consequently, as by the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> understanding or of science, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is made to be rightly disposed in regard to the universal principles of action; so, in order that he be rightly disposed with regard to the particular principles of action, viz. the ends, he needs to be perfected by certain <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, whereby it becomes connatural, as it were, to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to judge aright to the end. This is done by moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> judges aright of the end of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, because "such a man is, such does the end seem to him" (Ethic. iii, 5). Consequently the right reason about things to be done, viz. <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, requires <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to have moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason</a>, as apprehending the end, precedes the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> for the end: but <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> for the end precedes the reason, as arguing about the choice of the means, which is the concern of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Even so, in speculative matters the understanding of principles is the foundation on which the syllogism of the reason is based.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It does not depend on the disposition of our <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> whether we judge well or ill of the principles of art, as it does, when we judge of the end which is the principle in moral matters: in the former case our judgment depends on reason alone. Hence art does not require a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> perfecting the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, as <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> does.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">Prudence</a> not only helps us to be of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel, but also to judge and command well. This is not possible unless the impediment of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, destroying the judgment and command of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, be removed; and this is done by moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.
