<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether impotence is an impediment to marriage?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that impotence is not an impediment to marriage. For carnal copulation is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to marriage, since marriage is more perfect when both parties observe <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a> by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. But impotence deprives marriage of nothing save carnal copulation. Therefore it is not a diriment impediment to the marriage contract.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as impotence prevents carnal copulation so does frigidity. But frigidity is not reckoned an impediment to marriage. Therefore neither should impotence be reckoned as such.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, all old people are frigid. Yet old people can marry. Therefore, etc.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, if the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be frigid when she marries him, the marriage is valid. Therefore frigidity, considered in itself, is not an impediment to marriage.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, calidity may <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> a sufficient incentive to carnal copulation with one who is not a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, but not with one who is, because it happens to be so weak as to pass away quickly, and is therefore insufficient for the deflowering of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. Or again it may move a man sufficiently in regard to a beautiful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, but insufficiently in regard to an uncomely one. Therefore it would seem that frigidity, although it be an impediment in regard to one, is not an impediment absolutely.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, generally speaking <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is more frigid than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are not debarred from marriage. Neither therefore should men be debarred on account of frigidity.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is stated (Extra, De Frigidis et Malefic., cap. Quod Sedem): "Just as a boy who is incapable of marital intercourse is unfit to marry, so also those who are impotent are deemed most unfit for the marriage contract." Now <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> affected with frigidity are the like. Therefore, etc.

<p>Further, no one can bind himself to the impossible. Now in marriage <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> binds himself to carnal copulation; because it is for this purpose that he gives the other party power over his body. Therefore a frigid <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, being incapable of carnal copulation, cannot marry.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In marriage there is a contract whereby one is bound to pay the other the marital debt: wherefore just as in other contracts, the bond is unfitting if a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> bind himself to what he cannot give or do, so the marriage contract is unfitting, if it be made by one who cannot pay the marital debt. This impediment is called by the general name of impotence as regards coition, and can arise either from an intrinsic and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, or from an extrinsic and <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, for instance spell, of which we shall speak later (2). If it be due to a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, this may happen in two ways. For either it is temporary, and can be remedied by medicine, or by the course of time, and then it does not void a marriage: or it is perpetual and then it voids marriage, so that the party who labors under this impediment remains for ever without hope of marriage, while the other may "marry to whom she will . . . in the Lord" (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse39">1 Corinthians 7:39</a>). In order to ascertain whether the impediment be perpetual or not, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has appointed a fixed time, namely three years, for putting the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to a practical <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>: and if after three years, during which both parties have honestly endeavored to fulfil their marital intercourse, the marriage remain unconsummated, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> adjudges the marriage to be dissolved. And yet the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is sometimes mistaken in this, because three years are sometimes insufficient to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> impotence to be perpetual. Wherefore if the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> find that she has been mistaken, seeing that the subject of the impediment has completed carnal copulation with another or with the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, she reinstates the former marriage and dissolves the subsequent one, although the latter has been contracted with her permission. ["Nowadays it is seldom <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to examine too closely into this matter, as all cases arising from it are treated as far as possible under the form of dispensations of non-consummated marriages." Cf. <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">Catholic Encyclopedia, CANONICAL IMPEDIMENTS</a>.]

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although the act of carnal copulation is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to marriage, ability to fulfill the act is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a>, because marriage gives each of the <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> parties power over the other's body in relation to marital intercourse.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Excessive calidity can scarcely be a perpetual impediment. If, however, it were to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> an impediment to marital intercourse for three years it would be adjudged to be perpetual. Nevertheless, since frigidity is a greater and more frequent impediment (for it not only hinders the mingling of seeds but also weakens the members which co-operate in the union of bodies), it is accounted an impediment rather than calidity, since all <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> defects are reduced to frigidity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although old people have not sufficient calidity to procreate, they have sufficient to copulate. Wherefore they are allowed to marry, in so far as marriage is intended as a remedy, although it does not befit them as fulfilling an office of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> In all contracts it is agreed on all hands that anyone who is unable to satisfy an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> is unfit to make a contract which requires the fulfilling of that <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>. Now this inability is of two kinds. First, because a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is unable to fulfill the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> "de jure," and such inability renders the contract altogether void, whether the party with whom he contracts <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> of this or not. Secondly, because he is unable to fulfill "de facto"; and then if the party with whom he contracts <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> of this and, notwithstanding, enters the contract, this shows that the latter seeks some other end from the contract, and the contract stands. But if he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of it the contract is void. Consequently frigidity which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> such an impotence that a man cannot "de facto" pay the marriage debt, as also the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of slavery, whereby a man cannot "de facto" give his service freely, are <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> to marriage, when the one <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> party does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the other is unable to pay the marriage debt. But an impediment whereby a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> cannot pay the marriage debt "de jure," for instance <a href="../cathen/04264a.htm">consanguinity</a>, voids the marriage contract, whether the other party <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> of it or not. For this reason the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> holds (Sent. iv, D, 34) that these two <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a>, frigidity and slavery, make it not altogether unlawful for their subjects to marry.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot have a perpetual <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> impediment in regard to one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and not in regard to another. But if he cannot fulfill the carnal act with a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, while he can with one who is not a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, the hymeneal membrane may be broken by a medical instrument, and thus he may have connection with her. Nor would this be contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, for it would be done not for pleasure but for a remedy. Dislike for a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> extrinsic <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: and therefore we must form the same judgment in its regard as about spells, of which we shall speak further on (2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> The male is the agent in procreation, and the female is the patient, wherefore greater calidity is required in the male than in the female for the act of procreation. Hence the frigidity which renders the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> impotent would not disable the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. Yet there may be a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> impediment from another <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, namely stricture, and then we must judge of stricture in the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in the same way as of frigidity in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether a spell can be an impediment to marriage?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a spell cannot be an impediment to marriage. For the spells in question are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the operation of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> have no more power to prevent the marriage act than other bodily actions; and these they cannot prevent, for thus they would upset the whole world if they hindered eating and walking and the like. Therefore they cannot hinder marriage by spells.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> work is stronger than the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a>. But a spell is the work of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Therefore it cannot hinder marriage which is the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no impediment, unless it be perpetual, voids the marriage contract. But a spell cannot be a perpetual impediment, for since the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> has no power over others than sinners, the spell will be removed if the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be cast out, or by another spell, or by the exorcisms of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which are employed for the repression of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon's</a> power. Therefore a spell cannot be an impediment to marriage.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, carnal copulation cannot be hindered, unless there be an impediment to the generative power which is its principle. But the generative power of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is equally related to all <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. Therefore a spell cannot be an impediment in respect of one <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> without being so also in respect of all.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is stated in the Decretals (XXXIII, qu. 1, cap. iv): "If by sorcerers or witches . . . ," and further on, "if they be incurable, they must be separated."

<p>Further, the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>' power is greater than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a>: "There is no power upon earth that can be compared with him who was made to fear no one" (<a href="../bible/job041.htm#verse24">Job 41:24</a>). Now through the action of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> may be rendered incapable of carnal copulation by some power or by castration; and this is an impediment to marriage. Therefore much more can this be done by the power of a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some have asserted that witchcraft is nothing in the world but an imagining of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who ascribed to spells those <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> effects the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of which are hidden. But this is contrary to the authority of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men who state that the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> have power over men's bodies and imaginations, when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> allows them: wherefore by their means wizards can work certain signs. Now this opinion grows from the root of unbelief or incredulity, because they do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> save only in the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> of the common people, who ascribe to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> the terrors which a man conjures from his thoughts, and because, owing to a vivid <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, certain shapes such as he has in his thoughts become apparent to the senses, and then he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> that he sees the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. But such assertions are rejected by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> whereby we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> fell from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and that the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, and that by reason of their subtle <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> they are able to do many things which we cannot; and those who induce them to do such things are called wizards.

<p>Wherefore others have maintained that witchcraft can set up an impediment to carnal copulation, but that no such impediment is perpetual: hence it does not void the marriage contract, and they say that the laws asserting this have been revoked. But this is contrary to actual facts and to the new legislation which agrees with the old.

<p>We must therefore draw a distinction: for the inability to copulate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by witchcraft is either perpetual and then it voids marriage, or it is not perpetual and then it does not void marriage. And in order to put this to practical <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has fixed the space of three years in the same way as we have stated with regard to frigidity (1). There is, however this difference between a spell and frigidity, that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who is impotent through frigidity is equally impotent in relation to one as to another, and consequently when the marriage is dissolved, he is not permitted to marry another <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. whereas through witchcraft a man may be rendered impotent in relation to one <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and not to another, and consequently when the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> adjudges the marriage to be dissolved, each party is permitted to seek another partner in marriage.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The first corruption of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> became the slave of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> was transmitted to us by the act of the generative power, and for this reason <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> allows the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> to exercise his power of witchcraft in this act more than in others. Even so the power of witchcraft is made manifest in serpents more than in other animals according to <a href="../bible/gen003.htm">Genesis 3</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> tempted the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> through a serpent.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> work may be hindered by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> work with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> permission; not that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is stronger than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> so as to destroy His works by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Some spells are so perpetual that they can have no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> remedy, although <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> might afford a remedy by coercing the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> by desisting. For, as wizards themselves admit, it does not always follow that what was done by one kind of witchcraft can be destroyed by another kind, and even though it were possible to use witchcraft as a remedy, it would nevertheless be reckoned to be perpetual, since nowise ought one to invoke the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon's</a> help by witchcraft. Again, if the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> has been given power over a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> on account of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it does not follow that his power ceases with the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because the punishment sometimes continues after the fault has been removed. And again, the exorcisms of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> do not always avail to repress the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> in all their molestations of the body, if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will it so, but they always avail against those assaults of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> against which they are chiefly instituted.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Witchcraft sometimes <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> an impediment in relation to all, sometimes in relation to one only: because the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> not acting from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. Moreover, the impediment resulting from witchcraft may result from an impression made by the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> on a man's <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, whereby he is deprived of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> that moves him in regard to a particular <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and not to another.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether madness is an impediment to marriage?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> is not an impediment to marriage. For <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> marriage which is contracted in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is more excellent than carnal marriage. But mad <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> can be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. Therefore they can also marry.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, frigidity is an impediment to marriage because it impedes carnal copulation, which is not impeded by <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>. Therefore neither is marriage impeded thereby.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, marriage is not voided save by a perpetual impediment. But one cannot tell whether <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> is a perpetual impediment. Therefore it does not void marriage.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> that hinder marriage are sufficiently contained in the verses given above (<a href="#50">Article 50</a>). But they contain no mention of <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>. Therefore, etc.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Madness removes the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> more than <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> does. But <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is an impediment to marriage. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> is also.

<p>Further, mad <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are not fit for making contracts. But marriage is a contract. Therefore, etc.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> is either previous or subsequent to marriage. If subsequent, it nowise voids the marriage, but if it be previous, then the mad <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> either has lucid intervals, or not. If he has, then although it is not safe for him to marry during that interval, since he would not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to educate his children, yet if he marries, the marriage is valid. But if he has no lucid intervals, or marries outside a lucid interval, then, since there can be no consent without use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, the marriage will be invalid.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> as its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, in which way it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>. Hence the comparison fails. We have, however, spoken of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of mad <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> (III, 68, 12).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Madness impedes marriage on the part of the latter's <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> which is the consent, although not on the part of the act as frigidity does. Yet the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> treats of it together with frigidity, because both are defects of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> (Sent. iv, D, 34).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A passing impediment which hinders the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of marriage, namely the consent, voids marriage altogether. But an impediment that hinders the act must needs be perpetual in order to void the marriage.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> This impediment is reducible to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, since in either case there is lack of consent on the part of the reason.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether marriage is annulled by the husband committing incest with his wife's sister?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that marriage is not annulled by the husband committing <a href="../cathen/07717a.htm">incest</a> with his wife's sister. For the wife should not be punished for her husband's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Yet she would be punished if the marriage were annulled. Therefore, etc.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is a greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> one's own relative, than to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the relative of one's wife. But the former <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not an impediment to marriage. Therefore neither is the second.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if this is inflicted as a punishment of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it would seem, if the incestuous husband marry even after his wife's death, that they ought to be separated: which is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, this impediment is not mentioned among those enumerated above (<a href="#50">Article 50</a>). Therefore it does not void the marriage contract.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> By <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> his wife's sister he contracts affinity, with his wife. But affinity voids the marriage contract. Therefore the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/07717a.htm">incest</a> does also.

<p>Further, by whatsoever a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinneth</a>, by the same also is he punished. Now such a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against marriage. Therefore he ought to be punished by being deprived of marriage.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> If a man has connection with the sister or other relative of his wife before contracting marriage, even after his <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothal</a>, the marriage should be broken off on account of the resultant affinity. If, however, the connection take place after the marriage has been contracted and consummated, the marriage must not be altogether dissolved: but the husband loses his right to marital intercourse, nor can he demand it without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And yet he must grant it if asked, because the wife should not be punished for her husband's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But after the death of his wife he ought to remain without any hope of marriage, unless he receive a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> on account of his frailty, through fear of unlawful intercourse. If, however, he marry without a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>, he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by contravening the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but his marriage is not for this reason to be annulled.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections, for <a href="../cathen/07717a.htm">incest</a> is accounted an impediment to marriage not so much for its being a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as on account of the affinity which it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. For this reason it is not mentioned with the other <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a>, but is included in the impediment of affinity.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether defective age is an impediment to marriage?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that deficient age is not an impediment to marriage. For according to the laws children are under the care of a guardian until their twenty-fifth year. Therefore it would seem that before that age their reason is not sufficiently mature to give consent, and consequently that ought seemingly to be the age fixed for marrying. Yet marriage can be contracted before that age. Therefore lack of the appointed age is not an impediment to marriage.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as the tie of religion is perpetual so is the marriage tie. Now according to the new legislation (cap. Non Solum, De regular. et transeunt.) no one can be professed before the fourteenth year of age. Therefore neither could a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> marry if defective age were an impediment.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as consent is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for marriage on the part of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, so is it on the part of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. Now a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> can marry before the age of fourteen. Therefore a man can also.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, inability to copulate, unless it be perpetual and not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, is not an impediment to marriage. But lack of age is neither perpetual nor unknown. Therefore it is not an impediment to marriage.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, it is not included under any of the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> (50), and consequently would seem not to be an impediment to marriage.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a> (cap. Quod Sedem, De frigid et malefic.) says that "a boy who is incapable of marriage intercourse is unfit to marry." But in the majority of cases he cannot pay the marriage debt before the age of fourteen (De Animal. vii). Therefore, etc.

<p>Further, "There is a fixed limit of size and growth for all things in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>" according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Anima ii, 4): and consequently it would seem that, since marriage is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, it must have a fixed age by defect of which it is impeded.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since marriage is effected by way of a contract, it comes under the ordinance of positive <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> like other contracts. Consequently according to <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> (cap. Tua, De sponsal. impub.) it is determined that marriage may not be contracted before the age of discretion when each party is capable of sufficient deliberation about marriage, and of mutual fulfilment of the marriage debt, and that marriages otherwise contracted are void. Now for the most part this age is the fourteenth year in males and the twelfth year in <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>: but since the ordinances of positive <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> are consequent upon what happens in the majority of cases, if anyone reach the required perfection before the aforesaid age, so that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and reason are sufficiently developed to supply the lack of age, the marriage is not annulled. Wherefore if the parties who marry before the age of puberty have marital intercourse before the aforesaid age, their marriage is none the less perpetually indissoluble.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In matters to which <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> inclines there is not required such a development of reason in order to deliberate, as in other matters: and therefore it is possible after deliberation to consent to marriage before one is able to manage one's own affairs in other matters without a guardian.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The same answer applies, since the <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious vow</a> is about matters outside the inclination of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and which offer greater difficulty than marriage.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is said that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> comes to the age of puberty sooner than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does (De Animal. ix); hence there is no parallel between the two.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> In this case there is an impediment not only as to inability to copulate, but also on account of the defect of the reason, which is not yet qualified to give rightly that consent which is to endure in perpetuity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The impediment arising from defective age, like that which arises from <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, is reducible to the impediment of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; because a man has not yet the full use of his <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>.
