<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the angel's intellect is sometimes in potentiality, sometimes in act?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is sometimes in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> and sometimes in act. For movement is the act of what is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, as stated in Phys. iii, 6. But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>' minds are moved by understanding, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> minds are sometimes in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, since desire is of a thing not possessed but possible to have, whoever desires to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> anything is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> thereto. But it is said (<a href="../bible/1pe001.htm#verse12">1 Peter 1:12</a>): "On Whom the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> desire to look." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is sometimes in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in the book De Causis it is stated that "an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> understands according to the mode of its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> has some admixture of <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. Therefore it sometimes understands <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. ii): "Since the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of the Word, they enjoy <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and devout <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>." Now a contemplating <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, but in act. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is not in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (De Anima iii, text. 8; Phys. viii, 32), the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> in two ways; first, "as before learning or discovering," that is, before it has the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; secondly, as "when it possesses the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but does not actually consider." In the first way an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is never in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> with regard to the things to which his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> extends. For, as the higher, namely, the heavenly, bodies have no <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, which is not fully actuated, in the same way the heavenly <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellects</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, have no intelligible <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> which is not fully completed by connatural intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But with regard to things <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">divinely revealed</a> to them, there is nothing to hinder them from being in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>: because even the heavenly bodies are at times in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to being enlightened by the sun.

<p>In the second way an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can be in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> with regard to things learnt by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; for he is not always actually considering everything that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. But as to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Word, and of the things he beholds in the Word, he is never in this way in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>; because he is always actually beholding the Word, and the things he sees in the Word. For the bliss of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> consists in such vision; and beatitude does not consist in <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, but in act, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. i, 8).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Movement is taken there not as the act of something imperfect, that is, of something <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, but as the act of something perfect, that is, of one actually <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a>. In this way understanding and feeling are termed movements, as stated in De Anima iii, text. 28.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Such desire on the part of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> does not exclude the object desired, but weariness thereof. Or they are said to desire the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a> with regard to fresh <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelations</a>, which they receive from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to fit them for the tasks which they have to perform.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> there is no <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> divested of act. In the same way, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is never so in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> as to be without act.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether an angel can understand many things at the same time?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> cannot understand many things at the same time. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Topic. ii, 4) that "it may happen that we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> many things, but understand only one."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, nothing is understood unless the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> be informed by an intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; just at the body is formed by shape. But one body cannot be formed into many shapes. Therefore neither can one <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> simultaneously understand various intelligible things.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to understand is a kind of movement. But no movement terminates in various terms. Therefore many things cannot be understood altogether.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. iv, 32): "The <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> faculty of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> mind comprehends most easily at the same time all things that it wills."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As unity of term is requisite for unity of movement, so is unity of object required for unity of operation. Now it happens that several things may be taken as several or as one; like the parts of a continuous whole. For if each of the parts be considered severally they are many: consequently neither by sense nor by <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> are they grasped by one operation, nor all at once. In another way they are taken as forming one in the whole; and so they are grasped both by sense and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> all at once and by one operation; as long as the entire continuous whole is considered, as is stated in De Anima iii, text. 23. In this way our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands together both the subject and the predicate, as forming parts of one proposition; and also two things compared together, according as they agree in one point of comparison. From this it is evident that many things, in so far as they are distinct, cannot be understood at once; but in so far as they are comprised under one intelligible concept, they can be understood together. Now everything is actually intelligible according as its image is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. All things, then, which can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by one intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as one intelligible object, and therefore are understood simultaneously. But things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by various intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, are apprehended as different intelligible objects.

<p>Consequently, by such <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have of things through the Word, they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things under one intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, which is the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Therefore, as regards such <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things at once: just as in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> "our thoughts will not be fleeting, going and returning from one thing to another, but we shall survey all our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> at the same time by one glance," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xv, 16). But by that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> wherewith the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> things by innate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, they can at one time <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things which can be comprised under one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; but not such as are under various <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> To understand many things as one, is, so to speak, to understand one thing.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is informed by the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> which it has within it. So it can behold at the same time many intelligible objects under one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; as one body can by one shape be likened to many bodies.

<p>To the third objection the answer is the same as the first.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether an angel's knowledge is discursive?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is discursive. For the discursive movement of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> comes from one thing being <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through another. But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> one thing through another; for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> creatures through the Word. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> by discursive method.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever a lower power can do, the higher can do. But the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can syllogize, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> in effects; all of which is the discursive method. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, which is higher in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, can with greater reason do this.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> (De sum. bono i, 10) says that "<a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> learn more things by experience." But experimental <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is discursive: for, "one experience comes of many remembrances, and one universal from many experiences," as <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> observes (Poster. ii; Metaph. vii). Therefore an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is discursive.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. vii) that the "<a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not acquire Divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from separate discourses, nor are they led to something particular from something common."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As has often been stated (1; 55, 1), the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> hold that grade among <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> which the heavenly bodies hold among corporeal <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>: for <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> calls them "heavenly minds" (1; 55, 1). Now, the difference between heavenly and earthly bodies is this, that earthly bodies obtain their last perfection by chance and movement: while the heavenly bodies have their last perfection at once from their very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. So, likewise, the lower, namely, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellects</a> obtain their perfection in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by a kind of movement and discursive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> operation; that is to say, as they advance from one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> thing to another. But, if from the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> principle they were straightway to perceive as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> all its consequent conclusions, then there would be no discursive process at all. Such is the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, because in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> which they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, they at once behold all things whatsoever that can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in them.

<p>Therefore they are called "<a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> beings": because even with ourselves the things which are instantly grasped by the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> are said to be understood [intelligi]; hence "<a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>" is defined as the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of first principles. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> which acquire <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by the discursive method are called "rational"; and this comes of the feebleness of their <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> light. For if they possessed the fulness of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> light, like the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, then in the first aspect of principles they would at once comprehend their whole range, by perceiving whatever could be reasoned out from them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Discursion expresses movement of a kind. Now all movement is from something before to something after. Hence discursive <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> comes about according as from something previously <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> one attains to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of what is afterwards <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and which was previously unknown. But if in the thing perceived something else be seen at the same time, as an object and its image are seen simultaneously in a mirror, it is not discursive <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. And in this way the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> things in the Word.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> can syllogize, in the sense of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> a syllogism; and they see effects in <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> in effects: yet they do not acquire <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of an unknown <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in this way, by syllogizing from <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> to effect, or from effect to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Experience is affirmed of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> simply by way of similitude, forasmuch as they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> sensible things which are present, yet without any discursion withal.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the angels understand by composing and dividing?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> understand by composing and dividing. For, where there is multiplicity of things understood, there is composition of the same, as is said in De Anima iii, text. 21. But there is a multitude of things understood in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> mind; because <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> apprehend different things by various <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and not all at one time. Therefore there is composition and division in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> mind.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, negation is far more remote from affirmation than any two opposite natures are; because the first of distinctions is that of affirmation and negation. But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> certain distant natures not by one, but by diverse <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as is evident from what was said (2). Therefore he must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> affirmation and negation by diverse <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. And so it seems that he understands by composing and dividing.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, speech is a sign of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. But in speaking to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> use affirmative and negative expressions, which are signs of composition and of division in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; as is manifest from many passages of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Sacred Scripture</a>. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> understands by composing and dividing.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. vii) that "the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> power of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> shines forth with the clear simplicity of divine concepts." But a simple <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> is without composition and division. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> understands without composition or division.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, when reasoning, the conclusion is compared with the principle, so in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> composing and dividing, the predicate is compared with the subject. For if our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> were to see at once the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the conclusion in the principle, it would never understand by discursion and reasoning. In like manner, if the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in apprehending the quiddity of the subject were at once to have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all that can be attributed to, or removed from, the subject, it would never understand by composing and dividing, but only by understanding the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Thus it is evident that for the self-same reason our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands by discursion, and by composing and dividing, namely, that in the first apprehension of anything newly apprehended it does not at once grasp all that is virtually contained in it. And this comes from the weakness of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> light within us, as has been said (3). Hence, since the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> light is perfect in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, for he is a pure and most clear mirror, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv), it follows that as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> does not understand by reasoning, so neither does he by composing and dividing.

<p>Nevertheless, he understands the composition and the division of enunciations, just as he apprehends the reasoning of syllogisms: for he understands simply, such things as are composite, things movable immovably, and material things immaterially.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Not every multitude of things understood <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> composition, but a multitude of such things understood that one of them is attributed to, or denied of, another. When an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> apprehends the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of anything, he at the same time understands whatever can be either attributed to it, or denied of it. Hence, in apprehending a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, he by one simple perception grasps all that we can learn by composing and dividing.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The various natures of things differ less as to their mode of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> than do affirmation and negation. Yet, as to the way in which they are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, affirmation and negation have something more in common; because directly the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of an affirmation is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, the falsehood of the opposite negation is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> also.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The fact that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> use affirmative and negative forms of speech, shows that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> both composition and division: yet not that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by composing and dividing, but by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> simply the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a thing.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether there can be falsehood in the intellect of an angel?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there can be falsehood in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. For perversity appertains to falsehood. But, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv), there is "a perverted fancy" in the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. Therefore it seems that there can be falsehood in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, nescience is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of estimating <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>. But, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. vi), there can be nescience in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Therefore it seems there can be falsehood in them.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, everything which falls short of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of wisdom, and which has a depraved reason, has falsehood or <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in its <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. But <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. vii) affirms this of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. Therefore it seems that there can be <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii, text. 41) that "the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> is always <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>." <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> likewise says (QQ. 83, qu. 32) that "nothing but what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> can be the object of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>" Therefore there can be neither deception nor falsehood in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of this question depends partly upon what has gone before. For it has been said (4) that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> understands not by composing and dividing, but by understanding what a thing is. Now the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is always <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> as regards what a thing is, just as the sense regarding its proper object, as is said in De Anima iii, text. 26. But by <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, deception and falsehood creep in, when we understand the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of a thing by some kind of composition, and this happens either when we take the definition of one thing for another, or when the parts of a definition do not hang together, as if we were to accept as the definition of some creature, "a four-footed flying beast," for there is no such animal. And this comes about in things composite, the definition of which is drawn from diverse elements, one of which is as <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to the other. But there is no room for <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in understanding simple quiddities, as is stated in Metaph. ix, text. 22; for either they are not grasped at all, and so we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing respecting them; or else they are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> precisely as they <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>.

<p>So therefore, no falsehood, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, or deception can <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> of itself in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of any <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>; yet it does so happen <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>; but very differently from the way it befalls us. For we sometimes get at the quiddity of a thing by a composing and dividing process, as when, by division and demonstration, we seek out the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of a definition. Such is not the method of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; but through the (<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the) <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of a thing they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> everything that can be said regarding it. Now it is quite evident that the quiddity of a thing can be a source of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> with regard to everything belonging to such thing, or excluded from it; but not of what may be dependent on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> ordinance. Consequently, owing to their upright will, from their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of every creature, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> form no judgments as to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> therein, save under the Divine ordinance; hence there can be no <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> or falsehood in them. But since the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are utterly perverted from the Divine wisdom, they at times form their opinions of things simply according to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of the same. Nor are they ever deceived as to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> properties of anything; but they can be misled with regard to <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> matters; for example, on seeing a dead <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, they may suppose that he will not rise again, or, on beholding <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, they may judge Him not to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>From all this the answers to the objections of both sides of the question are evident. For the perversity of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> comes of their not being subject to the Divine wisdom; while nescience is in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> as regards things knowable, not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> but supernaturally. It is, furthermore, evident that their understanding of what a thing is, is always <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, save <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, according as it is, in an undue manner, referred to some composition or division.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether there is a "morning" and an "evening" knowledge in the angels?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is neither an evening nor a morning <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; because evening and morning have an admixture of darkness. But there is no darkness in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>; since there is no <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> nor falsehood. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> ought not to be termed morning and evening <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, between evening and morning the night intervenes; while noonday falls between morning and evening. Consequently, if there be a morning and an evening <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, for the same reason it appears that there ought to be a noonday and a night <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is diversified according to the difference of the objects <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>: hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii, text. 38), "The <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> are divided just as things are." But there is a threefold <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of things: to wit, in the Word; in their own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>; and in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> observes (Gen. ad lit. ii, 8). If, therefore, a morning and an evening <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> be admitted in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, because of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of things in the Word, and in their own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, then there ought to be admitted a third class of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, on account of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of things in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> mind.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. iv, 22,31; De Civ. Dei xii, 7,20) divides the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> into morning and evening <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The expression "morning" and "evening" <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> was devised by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>; who interprets the six days wherein <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made all things, not as ordinary days measured by the solar circuit, since the sun was only made on the fourth day, but as one day, namely, the day of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as directed to six classes of things. As in the ordinary day, morning is the beginning, and evening the close of day, so, their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the primordial being of things is called morning <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; and this is according as things <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the Word. But their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the very being of the thing <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>, as it stands in its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, is termed evening <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; because the being of things flows from the Word, as from a kind of primordial principle; and this flow is terminated in the being which they have in themselves.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Evening and morning <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> are not taken as compared to an admixture of darkness, but as compared to beginning and end. Or else it can be said, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> puts it (Gen. ad lit. iv, 23), that there is nothing to prevent us from calling something light in comparison with one thing, and darkness with respect to another. In the same way the life of the faithful and the just is called light in comparison with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, according to <a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse8">Ephesians 5:8</a>: "You were heretofore darkness; but now, light in the Lord": yet this very life of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, when set in contrast to the life of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, is termed darkness, according to <a href="../bible/2pe001.htm#verse19">2 Peter 1:19</a>: "You have the firm <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> word, whereunto you do well to attend, as to a light that shineth in a dark place." So the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by which he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> things in their own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, is day in comparison with <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; yet it is dark in comparison with the vision of the Word.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The morning and evening <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> belong to the day, that is, to the enlightened <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who are quite apart from the darkness, that is, from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spirits. The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, while <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the creature, do not adhere to it, for that would be to turn to darkness and to night; but they refer this back to the praise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in Whom, as in their principle, they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things. Consequently after "evening" there is no night, but "morning"; so that morning is the end of the preceding day, and the beginning of the following, in so far as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> refer to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> praise their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the preceding work. Noonday is comprised under the name of day, as the middle between the two extremes. Or else the noon can be referred to their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, Who has neither beginning nor end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> themselves are also creatures. Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of things in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is comprised under evening <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, as also the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of things in their own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the morning and evening knowledge are one?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the morning and the evening <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> are one. For it is said (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse5">Genesis 1:5</a>): "There was evening and morning, one day." But by the expression "day" the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> is to be understood, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. iv, 23). Therefore the morning and evening <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are one and the same.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is impossible for one faculty to have two operations at the same time. But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are always using their morning <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; because they are always beholding <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and things in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse10">Matthew 18:10</a>. Therefore, if the evening <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> were different from the morning, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> could never exercise his evening <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse10">1 Corinthians 13:10</a>): "When that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away." But, if the evening <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> be different from the morning, it is compared to it as the less perfect to the perfect. Therefore the evening <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> together with the morning <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. iv, 24): "There is a vast difference between <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> anything as it is in the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, and as it is in its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; so that the former belongs to the day, and the latter to the evening."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was observed (6), the evening <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is that by which the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> things in their proper <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. This cannot be understood as if they drew their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from the proper <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of things, so that the preposition "in" denotes the form of a principle; because, as has been already stated (55, 2), the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not draw their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from things. It follows, then, that when we say "in their proper <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>" we refer to the aspect of the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in so far as it is an object of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; that is to say, that the evening <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in so far as they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the being of things which those things have in their own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p>Now they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this through a twofold medium, namely, by innate <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, or by the forms of things <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the Word. For by beholding the Word, they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not merely the being of things as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the Word, but the being as possessed by the things themselves; as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by contemplating Himself sees that being which things have in their own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. If, therefore, it be called evening <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, in so far as when the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> behold the Word, they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the being which things have in their proper <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, then the morning and the evening <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> are <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> one and the same, and only differ as to the things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. If it be called evening <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, in so far as through innate <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the being which things have in their own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, then the morning and the evening <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> differ. Thus <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> seems to understand it when he assigns one as inferior to the other.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The six days, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> understands them, are taken as the six classes of things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; so that the day's unit is taken according to the unit of the thing understood; which, nevertheless, can be apprehended by various ways of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> There can be two operations of the same faculty at the one time, one of which is referred to the other; as is evident when the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> at the same time wills the end and the means to the end; and the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> at the same instant perceives principles and conclusions through those principles, when it has already acquired <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. iv, 24), the evening <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is referred to the morning <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; hence there is nothing to hinder both from being at the same time in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> On the coming of what is perfect, the opposite imperfect is done away: just as <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which is of the things that are not seen, is made void when vision succeeds. But the imperfection of the evening <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not opposed to the perfection of the morning <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For that a thing be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in itself, is not opposite to its being <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Nor, again, is there any inconsistency in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> a thing through two mediums, one of which is more perfect and the other less perfect; just as we can have a demonstrative and a probable medium for reaching the same conclusion. In like manner a thing can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> through the uncreated Word, and through an innate <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>.
