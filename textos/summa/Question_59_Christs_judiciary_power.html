<h1>Question 59. Christ's judiciary power</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/4059.htm#article1"> Is judiciary power to be attributed to Christ?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4059.htm#article2"> Does it belong to Him as man?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4059.htm#article3"> Did He acquire it by merits?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4059.htm#article4"> Is His judiciary power universal with regard to all men?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4059.htm#article5"> Besides the judgment that takes place now in time, are we to expect Him in the future general judgment?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4059.htm#article6"> Does His judiciary power extend likewise to the angels?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether judiciary power is to be specially attributed to Christ?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that judiciary power is not to be specially attributed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For judgment of others seems to belong to their lord; hence it is written (<a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse4">Romans 14:4</a>): "Who art thou that judgest another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> servant?" But, it belongs to the entire <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> to be Lord over creatures. Therefore judiciary power ought not to be attributed specially to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/dan007.htm#verse9">Daniel 7:9</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/01463a.htm">Ancient of days</a> sat"; and further on (<a href="../bible/dan007.htm#verse10">Daniel 7:10</a>), "the judgment sat, and the books were opened." But the <a href="../cathen/01463a.htm">Ancient of days</a> is understood to be the Father, because as <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (De Trin. ii): "<a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">Eternity</a> is in the Father." Consequently, judiciary power ought rather to be attributed to the Father than to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it seems to belong to the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to judge as it does to convince. But it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> to convince: for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> says (<a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse8">John 16:8</a>): "And when He is come," i.e. the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, "He will convince the world of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and of judgment." Therefore judiciary power ought to be attributed to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> rather than to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse42">Acts 10:42</a>): "It is He who was appointed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to be judge of the living end of the dead."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Three things are required for passing judgment: first, the power of coercing subjects; hence it is written (<a href="../bible/sir007.htm#verse6">Sirach 7:6</a>): "Seek not to be made a judge unless thou have strength enough to extirpate iniquities." The second thing required is upright zeal, so as to pass judgment not out of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, but from love of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, according to <a href="../bible/pro003.htm#verse12">Proverbs 3:12</a>: "For whom the Lord loveth, He chasteneth: and as a father in the son He pleaseth Himself." Thirdly, wisdom is needed, upon which judgment is based, according to <a href="../bible/sir010.htm#verse1">Sirach 10:1</a>: "A wise judge shall judge his people." The first two are <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> for judging; but on the third the very rule of judgment is based, because the standard of judgment is the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of wisdom or <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, according to which the judgment is passed.

<p>Now because the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is Wisdom begotten, and Truth proceeding from the Father, and His perfect Image, consequently, judiciary power is properly attributed to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Accordingly <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Vera Relig. xxxi): "This is that unchangeable Truth, which is rightly styled the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of all arts, and the art of the Almighty Craftsman. But even as we and all rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> judge aright of the things beneath us, so does He who alone is Truth itself pass judgment on us, when we cling to Him. But the Father judges Him not, for He is the Truth no less than Himself. Consequently, whatever the Father judges, He judges through It." Further on he concludes by saying: "Therefore the Father judges no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but has given all judgment to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument proves that judiciary power is common to the entire <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, which is quite <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: still by special appropriation such power is attributed to the Son, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. vi), <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is attributed to the Father, because He is the Principle, which is implied in the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. And in the same place <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is the art of the Father. So, then, judiciary authority is attributed to the Father, inasmuch as He is the Principle of the Son, but the very rule of judgment is attributed to the Son who is the art and wisdom of the Father, so that as the Father does all things through the Son, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is His art, so He judges all things through the Son, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is His wisdom and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And this is implied by <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">Daniel</a>, when he says in the first passage that "the <a href="../cathen/01463a.htm">Ancient of days</a> sat," and when he subsequently adds that the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> "came even to the <a href="../cathen/01463a.htm">Ancient of days</a>, who gave Him power, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and a kingdom": and thereby we are given to understand that the authority for judging lies with the Father, from whom the Son received the power to judge.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. xcv in Joan.): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> said that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> shall convince the world of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as if to say 'He shall pour out <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> upon your hearts.' For thus, when fear is driven away, you shall have freedom for convincing." Consequently, then, judgment is attributed to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, not as regards the rule of judgment, but as regards <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> desire to judge others aright.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether judiciary power belongs to Christ as man?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that judiciary power does not belong to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Vera Relig. xxxi) that judgment is attributed to the Son inasmuch as He is the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the first <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But this is Christ's attribute as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Consequently, judiciary power does not belong to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> but as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it belongs to judiciary power to reward the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, just as to punish the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. But <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> beatitude, which is the reward of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works, is bestowed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone: thus <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. xxiii super Joan.) that "the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is made blessed by participation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not by participation of a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>." Therefore it seems that judiciary power does not belong to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it belongs to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> judiciary power to judge secrets of hearts, according to <a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse5">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>: "Judge not before the time; until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts." But this belongs exclusively to the Divine power, according to <a href="../bible/jer017.htm#verse9">Jeremiah 17:9-10</a>: "The heart of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is perverse and unsearchable, who can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it? I am the Lord who search the heart, and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the reins: who give to every one according to his way." Therefore judiciary power does not belong to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> but as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse27">John 5:27</a>): "He hath given Him power to do judgment, because He is the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> (Hom. xxxix in Joan.) seems to think that judiciary power belongs to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> not as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but only as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Accordingly he thus explains the passage just quoted from John: "'He gave Him power to do judgment, because He is the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>: wonder not at this.' For He received judiciary power, not because He is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; but because He is the Son of the ineffable <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, therefore is He judge. But since the expressions used were greater than those appertaining to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, He said in explanation: 'Wonder not at this, because He is the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, for He is likewise the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.'" And he proves this by the effect of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">Resurrection</a>: wherefore He adds: "Because the hour cometh when the dead in their graves shall hear the voice of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>."

<p>But it must be observed that although the primary authority of judging rests with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nevertheless the power to judge is committed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> with regard to those subject to their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/deu001.htm#verse16">Deuteronomy 1:16</a>): "Judge that which is just"; and further on (<a href="../bible/deu001.htm#verse17">Deuteronomy 1:17</a>): "Because it is the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," that is to say, it is by His authority that you judge. Now it was said before (8, 1,4) that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> even in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is Head of the entire Church, and that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has "put all things under His feet." Consequently, it belongs to Him, even according to His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, to exercise judiciary power. on this account. it seems that the authority of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> quoted above must be interpreted thus: "He gave Him power to do judgment, because He is the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>"; not on account of the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, for thus all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> would have this kind of power, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> objects (Hom. xxxix in Joan.); but because this belongs to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Head, which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> received in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p>Now judiciary power belongs to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in this way according to His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> on three accounts. First, because of His likeness and kinship with men; for, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> works through intermediary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, as being closer to the effects, so He judges men through the Man Christ, that His judgment may be sweeter to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Hence (<a href="../bible/heb004.htm#verse15">Hebrews 4:15</a>) the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says: "For we have not a <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a>, who cannot have compassion on our infirmities; but one tempted in all things like as we are, without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Let us go therefore with confidence to the throne of His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>." Secondly, because at the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">last judgment</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. xix in Joan.), "there will be a <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of dead bodies</a>, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will raise up through the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>"; just as by "the same <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> He raises <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>," inasmuch as "He is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>." Thirdly, because, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> observes (De Verb. Dom., Serm. cxxvii): "It was but right that those who were to be judged should see their judge. But those to be judged were the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and the bad. It follows that the form of a servant should be shown in the judgment to both <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, while the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should be kept for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> alone."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Judgment belongs to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> as its standard, while it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> imbued with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, according as he is as it were one with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as a kind of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and "living <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>" [<a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, Ethic. v]. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> quotes (De Verb. Dom., Serm. cxxvii) the saying of <a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse15">1 Corinthians 2:15</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> judgeth all things." But beyond all creatures <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was more closely united with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and more full of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; according to <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John 1:14</a>: "We saw Him . . . full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." And according to this it belongs principally to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to judge all things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone to bestow beatitude upon <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> by a participation with Himself; but it is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> prerogative to bring them to such beatitude, inasmuch as He is their Head and the author of their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, according to <a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse10">Hebrews 2:10</a>: "Who had brought many children into <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, to perfect the author of their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> To <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and judge the secrets of hearts, of itself belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone; but from the overflow of the Godhead into <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> it belongs to Him also to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and to judge the secrets of hearts, as we stated above (Question 10, Article 2), when dealing with the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge of Christ</a>. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse16">Romans 2:16</a>): "In the day when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall judge the secrets of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether Christ acquired His judiciary power by His merits?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not acquire His judiciary power by His <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>. For judiciary power flows from the royal dignity: according to <a href="../bible/pro020.htm#verse8">Proverbs 20:8</a>: "The king that sitteth on the throne of judgment, scattereth away all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> with his look." But it was without <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> acquired royal power, for it is His due as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> Only-begotten Son: thus it is written (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse32">Luke 1:32</a>): "The Lord <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall give unto Him the throne of David His father, and He shall reign in the house of <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> for ever." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not obtain judiciary power by His <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), judiciary power is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> due inasmuch as He is our Head. But the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of headship does not belong to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by reason of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, but follows the personal union of the Divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>: according to <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John 1:14-16:</a> "We saw His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> . . . as of the Only-Begotten of the Father, full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> . . . and of His fulness we all have received": and this pertains to the notion of headship. Consequently, it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not have judiciary power from <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse15">1 Corinthians 2:15</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> judgeth all things." But a man becomes <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which is not from <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>; otherwise it is "no more <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>," as is said in <a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse6">Romans 11:6</a>. Therefore it seems that judiciary power belongs neither to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> nor to others from any <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, but from <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> alone.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/job036.htm#verse17">Job 36:17</a>): "Thy <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> hath been judged as that of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and judgment thou shalt recover." And <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Serm. cxxvii): "The Judge shall sit, who stood before a judge; He shall condemn the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, who Himself was <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> reputed <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There is nothing to hinder one and the same thing from being due to some one from various <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>: as the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the body in rising was due to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> not only as befitting His Godhead and His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, but likewise "from the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of the lowliness of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>" [Cf. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, Tract. civ in Joan.]. And in the same way it must be said that judiciary power belongs to the Man Christ on account of both His Divine personality, and the dignity of His headship, and the fulness of His <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: and yet He obtained it from <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, so that, in accordance with the Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, He should be judge who fought for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and conquered, and was <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> condemned. Hence He Himself says (<a href="../bible/rev003.htm#verse21">Apocalypse 3:21</a>): "I have overcome and am set down in My Father's throne [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'with My Father in His throne']." Now judiciary power is understood by "throne," according to <a href="../bible/psa009.htm#verse5">Psalm 9:5</a>: "Thou hast sat on the throne, who judgest <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument holds good of judiciary power according as it is due to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by reason of the union with the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument is based on the ground of His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> as Head.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument holds good in regard to <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which perfects Christ's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But although judiciary power be <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> due in these ways, it is not hindered from being His due from <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether judiciary power belongs to Christ with respect to all human affairs?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that judiciary power concerning all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs does not belong to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For as we read in <a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse13">Luke 12:13-14</a>, when one of the crowd said to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: "Speak to my brother that he divide the inheritance with me; He said to him: Man, who hath appointed Me judge, or divider over you?" Consequently, He does not exercise judgment over all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no one exercises judgment except over his own subjects. But, according to <a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse8">Hebrews 2:8</a>, "we see not as yet all things subject to" <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has not judgment over all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xx) that it is part of <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">Divine judgment</a> for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to be afflicted sometimes in this world, and sometimes to prosper, and in like manner the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. But the same was the case also before <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>. Consequently, not all <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> judgments regarding <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs are included in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> judiciary power.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse22">John 5:22</a>): "The Father hath given all judgment to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> If we speak of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> according to His Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, it is evident that every judgment of the Father belongs to the Son; for, as the Father does all things through His Word, so He judges all things through His Word.

<p>But if we speak of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, thus again is it evident that all things are subject to His judgment. This is made clear if we consider first of all the relationship subsisting between <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>; for, if "the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> judgeth all things," as is said in <a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse15">1 Corinthians 2:15</a>, inasmuch as his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> clings to the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, how much more <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is filled with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, passes judgment upon all things.

<p>Secondly, the same appears from the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of His death; because, according to <a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse9">Romans 14:9</a>: "To this end <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> died and rose again; that He might be Lord both of the dead and of the living." And therefore He has judgment over all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; and on this account the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> adds (<a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse10">Romans 14:10</a>): "We shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ": and (<a href="../bible/dan007.htm#verse14">Daniel 7:14</a>) it is written that "He gave Him power, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and a kingdom; and all peoples, tribes, and tongues shall serve Him."

<p>Thirdly, the same thing is evident from comparison of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs with the end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For, to whomsoever the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is entrusted, the accessory is likewise committed. Now all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs are ordered for the end of beatitude, which is everlasting <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, to which men are admitted, or from which they are excluded by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> judgment, as is evident from <a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse31">Matthew 25:31-40</a>. Consequently, it is manifest that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs are included in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> judiciary power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As was said above (3, Objection 1), judiciary power goes with royal dignity. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, although established <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">king</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, did not wish while living on earth to govern temporarily an earthly kingdom; consequently He said (<a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse36">John 18:36</a>): "My kingdom is not of this world." In like fashion He did not wish to exercise judiciary power over temporal concerns, since He came to raise men to Divine things. Hence <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> observes on this passage in Luke: "It is well that He who came down with a Divine purpose should hold Himself aloof from temporal concerns; nor does He deign to be a judge of quarrels and an arbiter of property, since He is judge of the quick and the dead, and the arbitrator of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> All things are subject to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in respect of that power, which He received from the Father, over all things, according to <a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse18">Matthew 28:18</a>: "All power is given to Me in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and in earth." But as to the exercise of this power, all things are not yet subject to Him: this will come to pass in the future, when He shall fulfil His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> regarding all things, by saving some and punishing others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Judgments of this kind were exercised by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> before His <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, inasmuch as He is the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> united with Him personally became a partaker of this power by <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether after the Judgment that takes place in the present time, there remains yet another General Judgment?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that after the Judgment that takes place in the present time, there does not remain another General Judgment. For a judgment serves no purpose after the final allotment of rewards and punishments. But rewards and punishments are allotted in this present time: for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said to the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a> on the cross (<a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse43">Luke 23:43</a>): "This day thou shalt be with Me in paradise": and (<a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse22">Luke 16:22</a>) it is said that "the rich <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> died and was buried in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>." Therefore it is useless to look forward to a final Judgment.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to another (the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>) version of <a href="../bible/nah001.htm#verse9">Nahum 1:9</a>, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall not judge the same thing a second time." But in the present time <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> judges both temporal and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> matters. Therefore, it does not seem that another final judgment is to be expected.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, reward and punishment correspond with <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> and demerit. But <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> and demerit bear relation to the body only in so far as it is the instrument of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore reward or punishment is not due to the body save as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> instrument. Therefore no other Judgment is called for at the end (of the world) to requite <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with reward or punishment in the body, besides that Judgment in which <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are now punished or rewarded.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said in <a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse48">John 12:48</a>: "The word that I have spoken, the same shall judge you [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'him'] in the last day." Therefore there will be a Judgment at the last day besides that which takes place in the present time.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Judgment cannot be passed perfectly upon any changeable subject before its consummation: just as judgment cannot be given perfectly regarding the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of any action before its completion in itself and in its results: because many actions appear to be profitable, which in their effects <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> to be hurtful. And in the same way perfect judgment cannot be passed upon any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> before the close of his life, since he can be changed in many respects from <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, or conversely, or from <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to better, or from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to worse. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse27">Hebrews 9:27</a>): "It is appointed unto men once to die, and after this the Judgment."

<p>But it must be observed that although <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> temporal life in itself ends with death, still it continues dependent in a measure on what comes after it in the future. In one way, as it still lives on in men's memories, in which sometimes, contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> reputations linger on. In another way in a man's children, who are so to speak something of their parent, according to <a href="../bible/sir030.htm#verse4">Sirach 30:4</a>: "His father is dead, and he is as if he were not dead, for he hath left one behind him that is like himself." And yet many <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> men have <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> sons, and conversely. Thirdly, as to the result of his actions: just as from the deceit of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and other <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> leaders unbelief continues to flourish down to the close of the world; and even until then <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> will continue to derive its progress from the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. In a fourth way, as to the body, which is sometimes buried with <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and sometimes left unburied, and finally falls to dust utterly. In a fifth way, as to the things upon which a man's heart is set, such as temporal concerns, for example, some of which quickly lapse, while others endure longer.

<p>Now all these things are submitted to the verdict of the Divine Judgment; and consequently, a perfect and public Judgment cannot be made of all these things during the course of this present time. Wherefore, there must be a final Judgment at the last day, in which everything concerning every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in every respect shall be perfectly and publicly judged.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Some men have held the opinion that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> shall not be rewarded in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, nor the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the lost punished in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, until the Judgment-day. That this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> appears from the testimony of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse8">2 Corinthians 5:8</a>), where he says: "We are confident and have a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will to be absent rather from the body, and to be present with the Lord": that is, not to "walk by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>" but "by sight," as appears from the context. But this is to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His Essence, wherein consists "<a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>," as is clear from <a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse3">John 17:3</a>. Hence it is manifest that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> separated from bodies are in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>.

<p>Consequently, it must be maintained that after death <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> enters into an unchangeable state as to all that concerns the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: and therefore there is no need for postponing judgment as to the reward of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But since there are some other things pertaining to a man which go on through the whole course of time, and which are not foreign to the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">Divine judgment</a>, all these things must be brought to judgment at the end of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. For although in regard to such things a man neither <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> nor demerits, still in a measure they accompany his reward or punishment. Consequently all these things must be weighed in the final judgment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall not judge twice the same thing," i.e. in the same respect; but it is not unseemly for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to judge twice according to different respects.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although the reward or punishment of the body depends upon the reward or punishment of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, nevertheless, since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is changeable only <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, on account of the body, once it is separated from the body it enters into an unchangeable <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, and receives its judgment. But the body remains subject to change down to the close of time: and therefore it must receive its reward or punishment then, in the last Judgment.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether Christ's judiciary power extends to the angels?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> judiciary power does not extend to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> alike were judged in the beginning of the world, when some fell through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> while others were confirmed in bliss. But those already judged have no need of being judged again. Therefore Christ's judiciary power does not extend to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> cannot be both judge and judged. But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> will come to judge with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse31">Matthew 25:31</a>: "When the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> shall come in His majesty, and all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> with Him." Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> will not be judged by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are higher than other creatures. If <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, then, be judge not only of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> but likewise of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, then for the same reason He will be judge of all creatures; which seems to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, since this belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>: hence it is written (<a href="../bible/job034.htm#verse13">Job 34:13</a>): "What other hath He appointed over the earth? or whom hath He set over the world which He made?" Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not the judge of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse3">1 Corinthians 6:3</a>): "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Know</a> you not that we shall judge <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>?" But the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> judge only by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> authority. Therefore, much more does Christ possess judiciary power over the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are subjects of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> judiciary power, not only with regard to His Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, as He is the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, but also with regard to His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. And this is evident from three considerations. First of all, from the closeness of His assumed <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; because, according to <a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse16">Hebrews 2:16</a>: "For nowhere doth He take hold of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but of the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> He taketh hold." Consequently, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is more filled with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> than any <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>: for which reason He also enlightens the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. vii), and so He has power to judge them. Secondly, because by the lowliness of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> to be exalted above the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; so that, as is said in <a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse10">Philippians 2:10</a>: "In the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name of Jesus</a> every knee should bow, of those that are in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, on earth, and under the earth." And therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has judiciary power even over the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>: in token whereof it is said in the Apocalypse (<a href="../bible/rev007.htm#verse11">7:11</a>) that "all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> stood round about the throne." Thirdly, on account of what they do for men, of whom <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the Head in a special manner. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse14">Hebrews 1:14</a>): "They are [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Are they not'] all ministering spirits, sent to minister for them, who shall receive the inheritance of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> (?)." But they are submitted to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> judgment, first, as regards the dispensing of those things which are done through them; which dispensing is likewise done by the Man Christ, to whom the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> ministered, as related (<a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse11">Matthew 4:11</a>), and from whom the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">devils</a> besought that they might be sent into the swine, according to <a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse31">Matthew 8:31</a>. Secondly, as to other <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> rewards of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, such as the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> which they have at the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, according to <a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse10">Luke 15:10</a>: "There shall be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> before the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> upon one sinner doing penance": and furthermore as to the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> punishments of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">devils</a> wherewith they are either tormented here, or are shut up in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>; and this also belongs to the Man Christ: hence it is written (<a href="../bible/mar001.htm#verse24">Mark 1:24</a>) that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> cried out: "What have we to do with thee, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>? art Thou come to destroy us?" Thirdly, as to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, which is everlasting bliss; and as to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> punishment of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, which is everlasting damnation. But this was done by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> from the beginning of the world, inasmuch as He is the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument considers judgment as to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward and chief punishment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Vera Relig. xxxi): "Although the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> judgeth all things, still he is judged by Truth Itself." Consequently, although the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> judge, as being <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> creatures, still they are judged by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, inasmuch as He is the Truth.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> judges not only the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but also the administration of all creatures. For if, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. ii.) the lower things are ruled by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through the higher, in a certain order, it must be said that all things are ruled by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is above every creature. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse5">Hebrews 2:5</a>): "For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath not subjected unto <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> the world to come"--subject namely to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>--"of whom we speak" [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'whereof we speak'] [The words "subject namely to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>" are from a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a>]. Nor does it follow that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> set another over the earth; since one and the same Person is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Man, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>.

<p>Let what has been said of the Mystery of His <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> suffice for the present.
