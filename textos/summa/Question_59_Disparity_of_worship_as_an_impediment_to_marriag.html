<h1>Question 59. Disparity of worship as an impediment to marriage</h1>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether a believer can marry an unbeliever?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a believer can marry an unbeliever. For <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> an Egyptian <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and Esther <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> Assuerus: and in both marriages there was <a href="../cathen/05037b.htm">disparity of worship</a>, since one was an unbeliever and the other a believer. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05037b.htm">disparity of worship</a> previous to marriage is not an impediment thereto.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> teaches the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as the New. But according to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> there could be marriage between a believer and an unbeliever, as evidenced by <a href="../bible/deu021.htm#verse10">Deuteronomy 21:10</a> seqq.: "If thou go out to the fight . . . and seest in the number of the captives a beautiful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and lovest her, and wilt have her to wife . . . thou shalt go in unto her, and shalt sleep with her, and she shall be thy wife." Therefore it is lawful also under the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothal</a> is directed to marriage. Now there can be a <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothal</a> between a believer and an unbeliever in the case where a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> is made of the latter's future conversion. Therefore under the same <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> there can be marriage between them.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, every impediment to marriage is in some way contrary to marriage. But unbelief is not contrary to marriage, since marriage fulfills an office of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> whose dictate <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> surpasses. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05037b.htm">disparity of worship</a> is not an impediment to marriage.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, there is sometime <a href="../cathen/05037b.htm">disparity of worship</a> even between two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, for instance when, after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> falls into <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Yet if such a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> marry a believer, it is nevertheless a valid marriage. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05037b.htm">disparity of worship</a> is not an impediment to marriage.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse14">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>): "What concord hath light with darkness? [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'What fellowship hath light with darkness? And what concord hath <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> with <a href="../cathen/02408a.htm">Belial</a>?']" Now there is the greatest concord between husband and wife. Therefore one who is in the light of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> cannot marry one who is in the darkness of unbelief.

<p>Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/mal002.htm#verse11">Malachi 2:11</a>): "<a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> hath profaned the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of the Lord, which he loved, and hath <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> the daughter of a strange god." But such had not been the case if they could have <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> validly. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05037b.htm">disparity of worship</a> is an impediment to marriage.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The chief <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of marriage is the offspring to be brought up to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now since education is the work of father and mother in common, each of them intends to bring up the child to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> according to their own <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Consequently if they be of different <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the one will be contrary to the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the other, and therefore there cannot be a fitting marriage between them. For this reason disparity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> previous to marriage is an impediment to the marriage contract.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> it was allowable to marry with certain unbelievers, and forbidden with others. It was however especially forbidden with regard to inhabitants of the land of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Canaan</a>, both because the Lord had commanded them to be slain on account of their obstinacy, and because it was fraught with a greater danger, lest to wit they should pervert to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> those whom they <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> or their children, since the Israelites were more liable to adopt their rites and customs through dwelling among them. But it was permitted in regard to other unbelievers, especially when there could be no fear of their being drawn into <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. And thus <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a>, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and Esther <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> unbelievers. But under the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> which is spread throughout the whole world the prohibition extends with equal reason to all unbelievers. Hence <a href="../cathen/05037b.htm">disparity of worship</a> previous to marriage is an impediment to its being contracted and voids the contract.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> either refers to other nations with whom they could lawfully marry, or to the case when the captive <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was willing to be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Present is related to present in the same way as future to future. Wherefore just as when marriage is contracted in the present, unity of worship is required in both contracting parties, so in the case of a <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothal</a>, which is a promise of future marriage, it suffices to add the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of future unity of worship.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> It has been made clear that <a href="../cathen/05037b.htm">disparity of worship</a> is contrary to marriage in respect of its chief <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the offspring.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Matrimony is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>: and therefore so far as the sacramental essentials are concerned, it requires purity with regard to the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, namely <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, rather than with regard to interior <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For which reason also this impediment is not called disparity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but <a href="../cathen/05037b.htm">disparity of worship</a> which concerns outward service, as stated above (Sent. iii, D, 9, 1, 1, qu. 1). Consequently if a believer marry a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, the marriage is valid, although he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by marrying her if he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> her to be a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>: even so he would <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> were he to marry an <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and yet the marriage would not be void: whereas on the other hand if a <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumen</a> having right <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> but not having been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> were to marry a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> believer, the marriage would not be valid.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether there can be marriage between unbelievers?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there can be no marriage between unbelievers. For <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is the door of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Therefore unbelievers, since they are not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, cannot marry any more than they can receive other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, two <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> are a greater impediment to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> than one. But the unbelief of only one party is an impediment to marriage. Much more, therefore, is the unbelief of both, and consequently there can be no marriage between unbelievers.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as there is <a href="../cathen/05037b.htm">disparity of worship</a> between believer and unbeliever, so can there be between two unbelievers, for instance if one be a heathen and the other a <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jew</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/05037b.htm">disparity of worship</a> is an impediment to marriage, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore there can be no valid marriage at least between unbelievers of different worship.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, in marriage there is real <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. But according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Adult. Conjug. i, 18) there is no real <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> between an unbeliever and his wife, and these words are quoted in the Decretals (XXVIII, qu. i, can. Sic enim.). Neither therefore is there a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> marriage.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> marriage excuses carnal intercourse from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But marriage contracted between unbelievers cannot do this, since "the whole life of unbelievers is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>," as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> observes on <a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse23">Romans 14:23</a>, "All that is not of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." Therefore there is no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> marriage between unbelievers.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 7:12</a>): "If any brother hath a wife that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> not, and she consent to dwell with him, let him not put her away." But she is not called his wife except by reason of marriage. Therefore marriage between unbelievers is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> marriage.

<p>Further, the removal of what comes after does not imply the removal of what comes first. Now marriage belongs to an office of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which precedes the state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a>, the principle of which is <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Therefore unbelief does not prevent the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of marriage between unbelievers.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Marriage was instituted chiefly for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the offspring, not only as to its begetting--since this can be effected even without marriage--but also as to its advancement to a perfect state, because everything intends <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> to bring its effect to perfection. Now a twofold perfection is to be considered in the offspring. one is the perfection of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, not only as regards the body but also as regards the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, by those means which are of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>. The other is the perfection of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: and the former perfection is material and imperfect in relation to the latter. Consequently, since those things which are for the sake of the end are proportionate to the end, the marriage that tends to the first perfection is imperfect and material in comparison with that which tends to the second perfection. And since the first perfection can be common to unbelievers and believers, while the second belongs only to believers, it follows that between unbelievers there is marriage indeed, but not perfected by its ultimate perfection as there is between believers.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Marriage was instituted not only as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but also as an office of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. And therefore, although marriage is not competent to unbelievers, as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> dependent on the dispensation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> ministers, it is nevertheless competent to them as fulfilling an office of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. And yet even a marriage of this kind is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> after the manner of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, although it is not actually since they do not marry actually in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05037b.htm">Disparity of worship</a> is an impediment to marriage, not by reason of unbelief, but on account of the difference of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For <a href="../cathen/05037b.htm">disparity of worship</a> hinders not only the second perfection of the offspring, but also the first, since the parents endeavor to draw their children in different directions, which is not the case when both are unbelievers.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As already stated (ad 1) there is marriage between unbelievers, in so far as marriage fulfills an office of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now those things that pertain to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> are determinable by positive <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>: and therefore if any <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> among unbelievers forbid the contracting of marriage with unbelievers of a different rite, the <a href="../cathen/05037b.htm">disparity of worship</a> will be an impediment to their intermarrying. They are not, however, forbidden by <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, because before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, however much one may stray from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, this makes no difference to one's being removed from <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: nor is it forbidden by any <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> who has not to judge of those who are without.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> and other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of unbelievers are said not to be real, because they cannot attain the end of real <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which is real <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Thus we say it is not a real wine if it has not the effect of wine.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> An unbeliever does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in having intercourse with his wife, if he pays her the marriage debt, for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the offspring, or for the troth whereby he is bound to her: since this is an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> which observes the due circumstance in pleasure of touch; even as neither does he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in performing acts of other civic <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Again, the reason why the whole life of unbelievers is said to be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not that they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in every act, but because they cannot be delivered from the bondage of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by that which they do.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the husband, being converted to the faith, may remain with his wife is she be unwilling to be converted?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that when a husband is converted to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> he cannot remain with his wife who is an unbeliever and is unwilling to be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>, and whom he had <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> while he was yet an unbeliever. For where the danger is the same one should take the same precautions. Now a believer is forbidden to marry an unbeliever for fear of being turned away from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Since then if the believer remain with the unbeliever whom he had <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> previously, the danger is the same, in fact greater, for neophytes are more easily perverted than those who have been brought up in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, it would seem that a believer, after being <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>, cannot remain with an unbeliever.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "An unbeliever cannot remain united to her who has been received into the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>" (<a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a>, XXVIII, qu. 1, can. Judaei). Therefore a believer is bound to put away a wife who does not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a marriage contracted between believers is more perfect than one contracted between unbelievers. Now, if believers marry within the degrees forbidden by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, their marriage is void. Therefore the same applies to unbelievers, and thus a <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> husband cannot remain with an unbelieving wife, at any rate, if as an unbeliever he <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> her within the forbidden degrees.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, sometimes an unbeliever has several wives recognized by his <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. If, then, he can remain with those whom he <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> while yet an unbeliever, it would seem that even after his conversion he can retain several wives.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, it may happen that after <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorcing</a> his first wife he has <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> a second, and that he is converted during this latter marriage. It would seem therefore that at least in this case he cannot remain with this second wife.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> counsels him to remain (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 7:12</a>).

<p>Further, no impediment that supervenes upon a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> marriage dissolves it. Now it was a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> marriage when they were both unbelievers. Therefore when one of them is <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>, the marriage is not annulled on that account; and thus it would seem that they may lawfully remain together.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> does not dissolve but perfects the marriage. Wherefore, since there is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> marriage between unbelievers, as stated above (2, ad 1), the marriage tie is not broken by the fact that one of them is converted to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but sometimes while the marriage tie remains, the marriage is dissolved as to cohabitation and marital intercourse, wherein unbelief and <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> are on a par, since both are against the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the offspring. Consequently, the husband has the same power to put away an unbelieving wife or to remain with her, as he has to put away an <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulterous</a> wife or to remain with her. For an innocent husband is free to remain with an <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulterous</a> wife in the hope of her amendment, but not if she be obstinate in her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, lest he seem to approve of her disgrace; although even if there be hope of her amendment he is free to put her away. In like manner the believer after his conversion may remain with the unbeliever in the hope of her conversion, if he see that she is not obstinate in her unbelief, and he does well in remaining with her, though not bound to do so: and this is what the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> counsels (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 7:12</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is easier to prevent a thing being done than to undo what is rightly done. Hence there are many things that impede the contracting of marriage if they precede it, which nevertheless cannot dissolve it if they follow it. Such is the case with affinity (55, 6): and it is the same with <a href="../cathen/05037b.htm">disparity of worship</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In the early Church at the time of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, both <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> were everywhere converted to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: and consequently the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> husband could then have a reasonable hope for his wife's conversion, even though she did not promise to be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>. Afterwards, however, as time went on the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> became more obstinate than the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> still continued to come to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, for instance, at the time of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and at the time of Constantine and thereabouts. Wherefore it was not safe then for a believer to cohabit with an unbelieving Jewish wife, nor was there hope for her conversion as for that of a <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> wife. Consequently, then, the believer could, after his conversion, cohabit with his wife if she were a <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a>, but not if she were a Jewess, unless she promised to be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>. This is the sense of that decree. Now, however, they are on a par, namely <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> and <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, because both are obstinate; and therefore unless the unbelieving wife be willing to be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>, he is not allowed to cohabit with her, be she <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> or <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jew</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Non-<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> unbelievers are not bound by the laws of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but they are bound by the ordinances of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>. Hence unbelievers who have <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> within the degrees forbidden by the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, whether both or one of them be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, cannot continue in a like marriage. But if they have <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> within the degrees forbidden by a commandment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, they can remain together if both be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>, or if one be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> and there be hope of the other's conversion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> To have several wives is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> by which even unbelievers are bound. Wherefore an unbeliever is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> save to her whom he <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> first. Consequently if he be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> with all his wives, he may remain with the first, and must put the others away. If, however, the first refuse to be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>, and one of the others be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>, he has the same right to marry her again as he would have to marry another. We shall treat of this matter further on (5).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> To <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> a wife is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, wherefore it is not lawful for an unbeliever to <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> his wife. Hence if he be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> after <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorcing</a> one and marrying another, the same judgment is to be pronounced in this case as in the case of a man who had several wives, because if he wish to be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> he is bound to take the first whom he had <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a> and to put the other away.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether a believer can, after his conversion, put away his unbelieving wife if she be willing to cohabit with him without insult to the Creator?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a believer, after his conversion, cannot put away his unbelieving wife if she be willing to cohabit with him without insult to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a>. For the husband is more bound to his wife than a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> to his master. But a converted <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> is not freed from the bond of slavery, as appears from <a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse21">1 Corinthians 7:21</a>; <a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse1">1 Timothy 6:1</a>. Therefore neither can a <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> husband put away his unbelieving wife.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no one may act to another's prejudice without the latter's consent. Now the unbelieving wife had a right in the body of her unbelieving husband. If, then, her husband's conversion to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> could be prejudicial to the wife, so that he would be free to put her away, the husband could not be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> without his wife's consent, even as he cannot receive orders or <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> without her consent.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if a man, whether <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> or free, knowingly marry a bondwoman, he cannot put her away on account of her different <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>. Since, then, the husband, when he <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> an unbeliever, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that she was an unbeliever, it would seem that in like manner he cannot put her away on account of her unbelief.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, a father is in <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> bound to work for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of his children. But if he were to leave his unbelieving wife, the children of their union would remain with the mother, because "the offspring follows the womb," and thus their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> would be imperiled. Therefore he cannot lawfully put away his unbelieving wife.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, an <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulterous</a> husband cannot put away an <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulterous</a> wife, even after he has done penance for his <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. Therefore if an <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulterous</a> and an unbelieving husband are to be judged alike, neither can the believer put aside the unbeliever, even after his conversion to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> are the words of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse15">1 Corinthians 7:15-16</a>).

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is more grievous than carnal. But a man can put his wife away, as to cohabitation, on account of carnal <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. Much more, therefore, can he do so on account of unbelief, which is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Different things are competent and expedient to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> according as his life is of one kind or of another. Wherefore he who dies to his former life is not bound to those things to which he was bound in his former life. Hence it is that he who vowed certain things while living in the world is not bound to fulfill them when he dies to the world by adopting the religious life. Now he who is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> is regenerated in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and dies to his former life, since the generation of one thing is the corruption of another, and consequently he is freed from the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> whereby he was bound to pay his wife the marriage debt, and is not bound to cohabit with her when she is unwilling to be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>, although in a certain case he is free to do so, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), just as a religious is free to fulfill the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> he took in the world, if they be not contrary to his <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a>, although he is not bound to do so.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Bondage is not inconsistent with the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, which makes a very special profession of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to a wife, or the conjugal bond, is somewhat derogatory to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life, the highest state of which is in the possession of the continent: hence the comparison fails. Moreover one <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> party is not bound to the other as the latter's possession, as a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> to his master, but by way of a kind of partnership, which is unfitting between unbeliever and believer as appears from <a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse15">2 Corinthians 6:15</a>; hence there is no comparison between a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> and a <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The wife had a right in the body of her husband only as long as he remained in the life wherein he had <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a>, since also when the husband dies the wife "is delivered from the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of her husband" (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse3">Romans 7:3</a>). Wherefore if the husband leave her after he has changed his life by dying to his former life, this is nowise prejudicial to her. Now he who goes over to the religious life dies but a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> death and not a bodily death. Wherefore if the marriage be consummated, the husband cannot enter religion without his wife's consent, whereas he can before carnal connection when there is only a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> connection. On the other hand, he who is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> is even corporeally buried together with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> unto death; and therefore he is freed from paying the marriage debt even after the marriage has been consummated.

<p>We may also reply that it is through her own fault in refusing to be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> that the wife suffers prejudice.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05037b.htm">Disparity of worship</a> makes a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> simply unfit for lawful marriage, whereas the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of bondage does not, but only where it is unknown. Hence there is no comparison between an unbeliever and a bondswoman.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Either the child has reached a perfect age, and then it is free to follow either the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> father or the unbelieving mother, or else it is under age, and then it should be given to the believer notwithstanding that it needs the mother's care for its <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> By doing penance the adulterer does not enter another life as an unbeliever by being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. Hence the comparison fails.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the believer who leaves his unbelieving wife can take another wife?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the believer who leaves his unbelieving wife cannot take another wife. For indissolubility is of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of marriage, since it is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> to <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> one's wife. Now there was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> marriage between them as unbelievers. Therefore their marriage can nowise be dissolved. But as long as a man is bound by marriage to one <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> he cannot marry another. Therefore a believer who leaves his unbelieving wife cannot take another wife.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a crime subsequent to marriage does not dissolve the marriage. Now, if the wife be willing to cohabit without insult to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a>, the marriage tie is not dissolved, since the husband cannot marry another. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the wife who refuses to cohabit without insult to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a> does not dissolve the marriage so that her husband be free to take another wife.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, husband and wife are equal in the marriage tie. Since, then, it is unlawful for the unbelieving wife to marry again while her husband lives, it would seem that neither can the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> husband do so.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> is more favorable than the marriage contract. Now seemingly it is not lawful for the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> husband to take a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> without the consent of his unbelieving wife, since then the latter would be deprived of marriage if she were afterwards converted. Much less therefore is it lawful for him to take another wife.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the son who persists in unbelief after his father's conversion loses the right to inherit from his father: and yet if he be afterwards <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>, the inheritance is restored to him even though another should have entered into possession thereof. Therefore it would seem that in like manner, if the unbelieving wife be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>, her husband ought to be restored to her even though he should have <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> another wife: yet this would be impossible if the <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">second marriage</a> were valid. Therefore he cannot take another wife.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Matrimony is not ratified without the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a>. Now what is not ratified can be annulled. Therefore marriage contracted in unbelief can be annulled, and consequently, the marriage tie being dissolved, it is lawful for the husband to take another wife.

<p>Further, a husband ought not to cohabit with an unbelieving wife who refuses to cohabit without insult to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a>. If therefore it were unlawful for him to take another wife he would be forced to remain continent, which would seem unreasonable, since then he would be at a disadvantage through his conversion.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> When either husband or wife is converted to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the other remaining in unbelief, a distinction must be made. For if the unbeliever be willing to cohabit without insult to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a>--that is without drawing the other to unbelief--the believer is free to part from the other, but by parting is not permitted to marry again. But if the unbeliever refuse to cohabit without insult to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a>, by making use of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> words and refusing to hear Christ's name, then if she strive to draw him to unbelief, the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> husband after parting from her may be united to another in marriage.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), the marriage of unbelievers is imperfect, whereas the marriage of believers is perfect and consequently binds more firmly. Now the firmer tie always looses the weaker if it is contrary to it, and therefore the subsequent marriage contracted in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> dissolves the marriage previously contracted in unbelief. Therefore the marriage of unbelievers is not altogether firm and ratified, but is ratified afterwards by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the wife who refuses to cohabit without insult to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a> frees the husband from the tie whereby he was bound to his wife so as to be unable to marry again during her lifetime. It does not however dissolve the marriage at once, since if she were converted from her <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> before he <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> again, her husband would be restored to her. But the marriage is dissolved by the <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">second marriage</a> which the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> husband would be unable to accomplish unless he were freed from his <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to his wife by her own fault.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> After the believer has <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a>, the marriage tie is dissolved on either side, because the marriage is not imperfect as to the bond, although it is sometimes imperfect as to its effect. Hence it is in punishment of the unbelieving wife rather than by virtue of the previous marriage that she is forbidden to marry again. If however she be afterwards <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>, she may be allowed by dispensation to take another husband, should her husband have taken another wife.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The husband ought not to take a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> nor enter into a <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">second marriage</a>, if after his conversion there be a reasonable hope of the conversion of his wife, because the wife's conversion would be more difficult if she <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> she was deprived of her husband. If however there be no hope of her conversion, he can take <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a> or enter religion, having first besought his wife to be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>. And then if the wife be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> after her husband has received <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy Orders</a>, her husband must not be restored to her, but she must take it as a punishment of her tardy conversion that she is deprived of her husband.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The bond of fatherhood is not dissolved by <a href="../cathen/05037b.htm">disparity of worship</a>, as the marriage bond is: wherefore there is no comparison between an inheritance and a wife.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether other sins dissolve marriage?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> besides unbelief dissolve marriage. For <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is seemingly more directly opposed to marriage than unbelief is. But unbelief dissolves marriage in a certain case so that it is lawful to marry again. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> has the same effect.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as unbelief is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> fornication, so is any kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. If, then unbelief dissolves marriage because it is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> fornication, for the same reason any kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> will dissolve marriage.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is said (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse30">Matthew 5:30</a>): "If thy right hand <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalize</a> thee, pluck it off and cast it from thee," and a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says that "by the hand and the right eye we may understand our brother, wife, relatives and children." Now these become obstacles to us by any kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore marriage can be dissolved on account of any kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> according to <a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse5">Ephesians 5:5</a>. Now a wife may be put away on account of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. Therefore in like manner she can be put away on account of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, as also on account of other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> graver than <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> says this expressly (Sent. iv, D, 30).

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse32">Matthew 5:32</a>): "Whosoever shall put away his wife, excepting for the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of fornication, maketh her to commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>."

<p>Further, if this were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorces</a> would be made all day long, since it is rare to find a marriage wherein one of the parties does not fall into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Bodily fornication and unbelief have a special contrariety to the goods of marriage, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). Hence they are specially effective in dissolving marriages. Nevertheless it must be observed that marriage is dissolved in two ways. In one way as to the marriage tie, and thus marriage cannot be dissolved after it is ratified, neither by unbelief nor by <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. But if it be not ratified, the tie is dissolved, if the one party remain in unbelief, and the other being converted to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> again. On the other hand the aforesaid tie is not dissolved by <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, else the unbeliever would be free to give a bill of <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> to his <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulterous</a> wife, and having put her away, could take another wife, which is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. In another way marriage is dissolved as to the act, and thus it can be dissolved on account of either unbelief or fornication. But marriage cannot be dissolved even as to the act on account of other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, unless perchance the husband wish to cease from intercourse with his wife in order to punish her by depriving her of the comfort of his presence.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is opposed to marriage as fulfilling an office of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, more directly than unbelief, it is the other way about if we consider marriage as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, from which source it derives perfect stability, inasmuch as it signifies the indissoluble union of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Wherefore the marriage that is not ratified can be dissolved as to the marriage tie on account of unbelief rather than on account of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The primal union of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and consequently the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is thereby espoused to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as it were, according to <a href="../bible/hos002.htm#verse20">Hosea 2:20</a>, "I will espouse thee to Me in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>." Hence in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> and unbelief are specially designated by the name of fornication: whereas other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are called <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> fornications by a more remote signification.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This applies to the case when the wife proves a notable occasion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to her husband, so that he has reason to fear his being in danger: for then the husband can withdraw from living with her, as stated above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Covetousness is said to be <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> on account of a certain likeness of bondage, because both the covetous and the idolater serve the creature rather than the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a>; but not on account of likeness of unbelief, since unbelief corrupts the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> whereas <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> corrupts the affections.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The words of the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> refer to <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothal</a>, because a <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothal</a> can be rescinded on account of a subsequent crime. Or, if he is speaking of marriage, they must be referred to the severing of mutual companionship for a time, as stated above, or to the case when the wife is unwilling to cohabit except on the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, for instance, if she were to say: "I will not remain your wife unless you amass <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> for me by <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>," for then he ought to leave her rather than thieve.
