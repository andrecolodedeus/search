<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether injustice is a special virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> is not a special <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse4">1 John 3:4</a>): "All <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Whosoever committeth <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, committeth also <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>; and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>']." Now <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> would seem to be the same as <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, because <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is a kind of equality, so that <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> is apparently the same as inequality or <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is contrary to all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> is contrary to all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: for as regards <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> it is opposed to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, as regards <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> it is opposed to meekness, and in like manner as regards the other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> is opposed to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> which is in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p>But every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> declares (De Duabus Anim. x). Therefore <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Injustice is contrary to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> is a special <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Injustice is twofold. First there is illegal <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> which is opposed to legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: and this is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> a special <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, in so far as it regards a special object, namely the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which it contemns; and yet it is a general <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, as regards the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, since contempt of the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> may lead to all kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Thus too all <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, as being repugnant to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, have the character of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, as though they arose from <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, in accord with what has been said above about <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> (58, 5,6). Secondly we speak of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> in reference to an inequality between one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and another, when one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> wishes to have more goods, <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> for example, or honors, and less <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, such as toil and losses, and thus <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> has a special <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and is a particular <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> opposed to particular <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Even as legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is referred to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, so Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is referred to the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, to which all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is repugnant, and in this sense all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is said to be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Even particular <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is indirectly opposed to all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; in so far, to wit, as even external acts pertain both to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and to the other moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, although in different ways as stated above (58, 09, ad 2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The will, like the reason, extends to all moral matters, i.e. <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and those external operations that relate to another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. On the other hand <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> perfects the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> solely in the point of its extending to operations that relate to another: and the same applies to <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether a man is called unjust through doing an unjust thing?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a man is called <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> through doing an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> thing. For <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are specified by their objects, as stated above (I-II, 54, 2). Now the proper object of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is the just, and the proper object of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> is the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>. Therefore a man should be called just through doing a just thing, and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> through doing an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> thing.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> declares (Ethic. v, 9) that they hold a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinion who maintain that it is in a man's power to do suddenly an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> thing, and that a just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is no less capable of doing what is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> than an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But this opinion would not be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> unless it were proper to the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to do what is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>. Therefore a man is to be deemed <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> from the fact that he does an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> thing.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> bears the same relation to its proper act, and the same applies to the contrary <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. But whoever does what is intemperate, is said to be intemperate. Therefore whoever does an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> thing, is said to be <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. v, 6) that "a man may do an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> thing without being <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Even as the object of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is something equal in external things, so too the object of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> is something unequal, through more or less being assigned to some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> than is due to him. To this object the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> is compared by means of its proper act which is called an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>. Accordingly it may happen in two ways that a man who does an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> thing, is not <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>: first, on account of a lack of correspondence between the operation and its proper object. For the operation takes its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and name from its direct and not from its indirect object: and in things directed to an end the direct is that which is intended, and the indirect is what is beside the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>. Hence if a man do that which is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, without intending to do an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> thing, for instance if he do it through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, being unaware that it is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, properly speaking he does an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> thing, not directly, but only indirectly, and, as it were, doing materially that which is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>: hence such an operation is not called an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>. Secondly, this may happen on account of a lack of proportion between the operation and the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. For an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> may sometimes arise from a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, for instance, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> or desire, and sometimes from choice, for instance when the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> itself is the direct object of one's complacency. On the latter case properly speaking it arises from a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, because whenever a man has a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, whatever befits that <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is, of itself, pleasant to him. Accordingly, to do what is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> intentionally and by choice is proper to the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in which sense the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is one who has the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>: but a man may do what is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, unintentionally or through passion, without having the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is specified by its object in its direct and formal acceptation, not in its material and indirect acceptation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is not easy for any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to do an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> thing from choice, as though it were pleasing for its own sake and not for the sake of something else: this is proper to one who has the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> declares (Ethic. v, 9).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The object of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is not something established externally, as is the object of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: the object of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, i.e. the temperate thing, depends entirely on proportion to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> himself. Consequently what is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> and unintentional cannot be said to be temperate either materially or formally. On like manner neither can it be called intemperate: and in this respect there is dissimilarity between <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and the other moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; but as regards the proportion between operation and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, there is similarity in all respects.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether we can suffer injustice willingly?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one can suffer <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> willingly. For <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> is inequality, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Now a man by injuring himself, departs from equality, even as by injuring another. Therefore a man can do an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> to himself, even as to another. But whoever does himself an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, does so involuntarily. Therefore a man can <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> suffer <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> especially if it be inflicted by himself.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is punished by the <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>, except for having committed some <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>. Now suicides were formerly punished according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the state by being deprived of an honorable burial, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> declares (Ethic. v, 11). Therefore a man can do himself an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, and consequently it may happen that a man suffers <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> save to one who suffers that <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>. But it may happen that a man does an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> to one who wishes it, for instance if he sell him a thing for more than it is worth. Therefore a man may happen to suffer an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> To suffer an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> and to do an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> are contraries. Now no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> against his will. Therefore on the other hand no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> suffers an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> except against his will.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Action by its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> proceeds from an agent, whereas passion as such is from another: wherefore the same thing in the same respect cannot be both agent and patient, as stated in Phys. iii, 1; viii, 5. Now the proper principle of action in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, wherefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does properly and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> what he does <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>, and on the other hand a man suffers properly what he suffers against his will, since in so far as he is willing, he is a principle in himself, and so, considered thus, he is active rather than passive. Accordingly we must conclude that properly and strictly speaking no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can do an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> except <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>, nor suffer an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> save involuntarily; but that <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> and materially so to speak, it is possible for that which is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> in itself either to be done involuntarily (as when a man does anything unintentionally), or to be suffered <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> (as when a man <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> gives to another more than he owes him).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> When one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> gives <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> to another that which he does not owe him, he <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> neither <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> nor inequality. For a man's ownership depends on his will, so there is no disproportion if he forfeit something of his own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, either by his own or by another's action.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> An <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> may be considered in two ways. First, with regard to himself; and thus, if he inflict an injury on himself, it may come under the head of some other kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, intemperance for instance or imprudence, but not <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>; because <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> no less than <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, is always referred to another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Secondly, this or that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may be considered as belonging to the State as part thereof, or as belonging to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as His creature and image; and thus a man who kills himself, does an injury not indeed to himself, but to the State and to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore he is punished in accordance with both Divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, even as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> declares in respect of the fornicator (<a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse17">1 Corinthians 3:17</a>): "If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> violate the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, him shall <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> destroy."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Suffering is the effect of external action. Now in the point of doing and suffering <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, the material element is that which is done externally, considered in itself, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), and the formal and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> element is on the part of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of agent and patient, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Accordingly we must reply that <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> suffered by one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> done by another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> always accompany one another, in the material sense. But if we speak in the formal sense a man can do an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of doing an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, and yet the other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not suffer an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, because he suffers <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>; and on the other hand a man can suffer an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> if he suffer an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> against his will, while the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who does the injury unknowingly, does an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, not formally but only materially.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether whoever does an injustice sins mortally?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that not everyone who does an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally. For venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is opposed to mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now it is sometimes a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to do an injury: for the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. v, 8) in reference to those who act <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>: "Whatever they do not merely in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> but through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is a venial <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>." Therefore not everyone that does an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, he who does an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> in a small <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, departs but slightly from the mean. Now this seems to be insignificant and should be accounted among the least of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> declares (Ethic. ii, 9). Therefore not everyone that does an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is the "mother of all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>" [<a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>, Sent. iii, D. 23, and it is through being contrary thereto that a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is called mortal. But not all the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> contrary to the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are mortal. Therefore neither is it always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to do an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Whatever is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now whoever does an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> does that which is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since it amounts either to <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>, or to <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, or to <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, or to something of the kind, as will be shown further on (64, seqq.). Therefore whoever does an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (I-II, 12, 5), when we were treating of the distinction of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is one that is contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> which gives life to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Now every injury inflicted on another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is of itself contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which moves us to will the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of another. And so since <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> always consists in an injury inflicted on another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, it is evident that to do an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> according to its genus.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This saying of the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> is to be understood as referring to <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of fact, which he calls "<a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of particular circumstances" [Ethic. iii, 1, and which deserves pardon, and not to <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> which does not excuse: and he who does an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, does no <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> except <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>)

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> He who does an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> in small matters falls short of the perfection on an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, in so far as what he does may be deemed not altogether contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who suffers therefrom: for instance, if a man take an apple or some such thing from another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in which case it is probable that the latter is not hurt or displeased.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are contrary to the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not always hurtful to another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, but imply a disorder affecting <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>; hence there is no comparison.
