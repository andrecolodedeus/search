<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether moral virtue is a passion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>. Because the mean is of the same genus as the extremes. But moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a mean between two <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Therefore moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, being contrary to one another, are in the same genus. But some <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are reckoned to be <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, such as <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. Therefore some <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, pity is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, since it is sorrow for another's ills, as stated above (Question 35, Article 8). Now "Cicero the renowned orator did not hesitate to call pity a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states in De Civ. Dei ix, 5. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> may be a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is stated in Ethic. ii, 5 that "<a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are neither <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> nor <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> cannot be a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>. This is clear for three reasons. First, because a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> is a movement of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, as stated above (Question 22, Article 3): whereas moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not a movement, but rather a principle of the movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, being a kind of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. Secondly, because <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are not in themselves <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is something in reference to reason: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, considered in themselves, are referable both to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, for as much as they may accord or disaccord with reason. Now nothing of this sort can be a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: since <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is referable to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> alone, as stated above (Question 55, Article 3). Thirdly, because, granted that some <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are, in some way, referable to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> only, or to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> only; even then the movement of passion, as passion, begins in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, and ends in the reason, since the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> tends to conformity with reason. On the other hand, the movement of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is the reverse, for it begins in the reason and ends in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, inasmuch as the latter is moved by reason. Hence the definition of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> (Ethic. ii, 6) states that it is "a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of choosing the mean appointed by reason as a <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would appoint it."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Virtue is a mean between <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, not by reason of its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, but on account of its effect; because, to wit, it establishes the mean between <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> If by <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> we understand a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of doing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, it is evident that no passion is a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. But if <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is taken to mean <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> act, nothing hinders a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> from being a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, or, on the other hand, from concurring in an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; in so far as a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> is either opposed to reason or in accordance with reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Pity is said to be a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, i.e. an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, in so far as "that movement of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is obedient to reason"; viz. "when pity is bestowed without violating right, as when the poor are relieved, or the penitent forgiven," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei ix, 5). But if by pity we understand a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> perfecting <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> so that he bestows pity reasonably, nothing hinders pity, in this sense, from being a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. The same applies to similar <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether there can be moral virtue with passion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> cannot be with passion. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Topic. iv) that "a gentle <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is one who is not passionate; but a patient <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is one who is passionate but does not give way." The same applies to all the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Therefore all moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are without passion.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a right affection of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as health is to the body, as stated Phys. vii, text. 17: wherefore "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a kind of health of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>," as Cicero says (Quaest. Tusc. iv). But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are "the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> diseases," as he says in the same book. Now health is incompatible with disease. Therefore neither is passion compatible with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> requires perfect use of reason even in particular matters. But the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are an obstacle to this: for the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vi, 5) that "pleasures destroy the judgment of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>": and Sallust says (Catilin.) that "when they," i.e. the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, "interfere, it is not easy for the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to grasp the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." Therefore passion is incompatible with moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 6): "If the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is perverse, these movements," viz. the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, "are perverse also: but if it is upright, they are not only blameless, but even praiseworthy." But nothing praiseworthy is incompatible with moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> does not exclude the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, but is consistent with them.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The Stoics and Peripatetics disagreed on this point, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> relates (De Civ. Dei ix, 4). For the Stoics held that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> cannot be in a wise or <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: whereas the Peripatetics, who were founded by <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei ix, 4), maintained that the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are compatible with moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, if they be reduced to the mean.

<p>This difference, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> observes (De Civ. Dei ix, 4), was one of words rather than of opinions. Because the Stoics, through not discriminating between the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, which is divided into irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>, did not, as the Peripatetics did, distinguish the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> from the other affections of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in the point of their being movements of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, whereas the other emotions of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which are not <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, are movements of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> or will; but only in the point of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> being, as they maintained, any emotions in disaccord with reason. These emotions could not be in a wise or <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> if they arose deliberately: while it would be possible for them to be in a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, if they arose suddenly: because, in the words of Aulus Gellius [Noct. Attic. xix, 1, quoted by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei ix, 4), "it is not in our power to call up the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">visions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as its fancies; and when they arise from awesome things, they must needs disturb the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, so that he is slightly startled by fear, or depressed with sorrow," in so far as "these <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> forestall the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> without his approving of such things or consenting thereto."

<p>Accordingly, if the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> be taken for inordinate emotions, they cannot be in a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, so that he consent to them deliberately; as the Stoics maintained. But if the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> be taken for any movements of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, they can be in a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in so far as they are subordinate to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> says (Ethic. ii, 3) that "some describe <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> as being a kind of freedom from passion and disturbance; this is incorrect, because the assertion should be qualified": they should have said <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is freedom from those <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> "that are not as they should be as to manner and time."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> quotes this, as well as many other examples in his books on Logic, in order to illustrate, not his own mind, but that of others. It was the opinion of the Stoics that the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> were incompatible with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> rejects this opinion (Ethic. ii, 3), when he says that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not freedom from passion. It may be said, however, that when he says "a gentle <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not passionate," we are to understand this of inordinate passion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This and all similar arguments which Tully brings forward in De Tusc. Quaest. iv take the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> in the execution of reason's command.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> When a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> forestalls the judgment of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, so as to prevail on the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to give its consent, it hinders counsel and the judgment of reason. But when it follows that judgment, as through being commanded by reason, it helps towards the execution of reason's command.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether sorrow is compatible with moral virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that sorrow is incompatible with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Because the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are effects of wisdom, according to <a href="../bible/wis008.htm#verse7">Wisdom 8:7</a>: "She," i.e. Divine wisdom, "teacheth <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>." Now the "conversation" of wisdom "hath no bitterness," as we read further on (verse 16). Therefore sorrow is incompatible with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> also.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, sorrow is a hindrance to work, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. vii, 13; x, 5). But a hindrance to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works is incompatible with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore sorrow is incompatible with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, Tully calls sorrow a disease of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> (De Tusc. Quaest. iv). But disease of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is incompatible with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. Therefore sorrow is opposed to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and is incompatible with it.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was perfect in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But there was sorrow in Him, for He said (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse38">Matthew 26:38</a>): "My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is sorrowful even unto death." Therefore sorrow is compatible with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 8), the Stoics held that in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> there are three <em>eupatheiai</em>, i.e. "three <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>," in place of the three disturbances: viz. instead of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, "desire"; instead of mirth, "<a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>"; instead of fear, "caution." But they denied that anything corresponding to sorrow could be in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, for two reasons.

<p>First, because sorrow is for an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that is already present. Now they held that no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> can happen to a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: for they thought that, just as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> only <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and bodily goods are no <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; so <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> only <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, which cannot be in a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But this is unreasonable. For, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is composed of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, whatever conduces to preserve the life of the body, is some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; yet not his <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a>, because he can abuse it. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which is contrary to this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> can be in a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and can <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> him moderate sorrow. Again, although a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can be without grave <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, yet no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is to be found to live without committing slight <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#verse8">1 John 1:8</a>: "If we say that we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we deceive ourselves." A third reason is because a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, though not actually in a state of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, may have been so in the past. And he is to be commended if he sorrow for that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/2co007.htm#verse10">2 Corinthians 7:10</a>: "The sorrow that is according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> worketh penance steadfast unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>." Fourthly, because he may praiseworthily sorrow for another's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore sorrow is compatible with moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in the same way as the other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are when moderated by reason.

<p>Their second reason for holding this opinion was that sorrow is about <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> present, whereas fear is for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to come: even as pleasure is about a present <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, while desire is for a future <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now the enjoyment of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> possessed, or the desire to have <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that one possesses not, may be consistent with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: but depression of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> resulting from sorrow for a present <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, is altogether contrary to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>: wherefore it is incompatible with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But this is unreasonable. For there is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which can be present to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as we have just stated; which <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is rejected by reason. Wherefore the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> follows reason's rejection by sorrowing for that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; yet moderately, according as reason dictates. Now it pertains to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> be conformed to reason, as stated above (1, ad 2). Wherefore moderated sorrow for an object which ought to make us sorrowful, is a mark of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; as also the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 6,7). Moreover, this proves useful for avoiding <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: since, just as <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is more readily sought for the sake of pleasure, so is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> more undauntedly shunned on account of sorrow.

<p>Accordingly we must allow that sorrow for things pertaining to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is incompatible with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: since <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> rejoices in its own. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> sorrows moderately for all that thwarts <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, no matter how.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The passage quoted proves that the wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not made sorrowful by wisdom. Yet he sorrows for anything that hinders wisdom. Consequently there is no room for sorrow in the blessed, in whom there can be no hindrance to wisdom.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Sorrow hinders the work that makes us sorrowful: but it helps us to do more readily whatever banishes sorrow.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Immoderate sorrow is a disease of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>: but moderate sorrow is the mark of a well-conditioned mind, according to the present state of life.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether all the moral virtues are about the passions?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that all the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are about the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 3) that "moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is about objects of pleasure and sorrow." But pleasure and sorrow are <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, as stated above (23, 4; 31, 1; 35, A1, 2). Therefore all the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are about the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the subject of the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> is a faculty which is rational by participation, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. i, 13). But the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are in this part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as stated above (Question 22, Article 3). Therefore every moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is about the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, some passion is to be found in every moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: and so either all are about the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, or none are. But some are about the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, as <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> and <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, as stated in Ethic. iii, 6,10. Therefore all the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are about the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Justice, which is a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, is not about the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>; as stated in Ethic. v, 1, seqq.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> perfects the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by directing it to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as defined by reason. Now <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as defined by reason is that which is moderated or directed by reason. Consequently there are moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> about all matters that are subject to reason's direction and moderation. Now reason directs, not only the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, but also the operations of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which is not the subject of a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, as stated above (Question 22, Article 3). Therefore not all the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are about <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, but some are about <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, some about operations.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not all about pleasures and sorrows, as being their proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; but as being something resulting from their proper acts. For every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> rejoices in acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and sorrows for the contrary. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a>, after the words quoted, adds, "if <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are about actions and <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>; now every action and passion is followed by pleasure or sorrow, so that in this way <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is about pleasures and sorrows," viz. as about something that results from <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Not only the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> which is the subject of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, is rational by participation, but also the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, where there are no <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Some <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> have <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> as their proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but some <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> not. Hence the comparison does not hold for all cases.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether there can be moral virtue without passion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> can be without passion. For the more perfect moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is, the more does it overcome the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Therefore at its highest point of perfection it is altogether without passion.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, then is a thing perfect, when it is removed from its contrary and from whatever inclines to its contrary. Now the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> incline us to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is contrary to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: hence (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse5">Romans 7:5</a>) they are called "<a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." Therefore perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is altogether without passion.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is by <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that we are conformed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> declares (De Moribus Eccl. vi, xi, xiii). But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does all things without passion at all. Therefore the most perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is without any passion.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> "No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is just who rejoices not in his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>," as stated in Ethic. i, 8. But <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> cannot be without passion; and still less can the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> be.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> If we take the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> as being inordinate emotions, as the Stoics did, it is evident that in this sense perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is without the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. But if by <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> we understand any movement of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, it is plain that moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, which are about the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> as about their proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, cannot be without <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. The reason for this is that otherwise it would follow that moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> makes the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> altogether idle: whereas it is not the function of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to deprive the powers subordinate to reason of their proper activities, but to make them execute the commands of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, by exercising their proper acts. Wherefore just as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> directs the bodily limbs to their due external acts, so does it direct the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> to its proper regulated movements.

<p>Those moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, however, which are not about the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, but about operations, can be without <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Such a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: because it applies the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to its proper act, which is not a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>. Nevertheless, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> results from the act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; at least in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, in which case it is not a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>. And if this <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> be increased through the perfection of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, it will overflow into the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; in so far as the lower powers follow the movement of the higher, as stated above (17, 7; 24, 3). Wherefore by reason of this kind of overflow, the more perfect a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is, the more does it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> passion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Virtue overcomes inordinate passion; it produces ordinate passion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is inordinate, not ordinate, passion that leads to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of anything depends on the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now there is no sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as there is in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Consequently <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> operation in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> is altogether without passion, as it is without a body: whereas the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> operation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is with passion, even as it is produced with the body's help.
