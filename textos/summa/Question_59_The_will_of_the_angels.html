<h1>Question 59. The will of the angels</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1059.htm#article1"> Is there will in the angels?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1059.htm#article2"> Is the will of the angel his nature, or his intellect?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1059.htm#article3"> Is there free-will in the angels?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1059.htm#article4"> Is there an irascible and a concupiscible appetite in them?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether there is will in the angels?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is no will in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii, text. 42), "The <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is in the reason." But there is no reason in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but something higher than reason. Therefore there is no will in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but something higher than the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is comprised under the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, as is evident from the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Anima iii, text. 42). But the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> argues something imperfect; because it is a desire of something not as yet possessed. Therefore, since there is no imperfection in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, especially in the blessed ones, it seems that there is no will in them.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima ii, text. 54) that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is a mover which is moved; for it is moved by the appetible object understood. Now the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are immovable, since they are incorporeal. Therefore there is no will in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. x, 11,12) that the image of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> is found in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> according to <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, understanding, and will. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> image is found not only in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but also in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> mind, since it also is capable of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore there is will in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We must <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> place a will in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. In evidence thereof, it must be borne in mind that, since all things flow from the Divine will, all things in their own way are inclined by <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but in different ways. Some are inclined to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination, without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, as plants and inanimate bodies. Such inclination towards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is called "a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>." Others, again, are inclined towards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but with some <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; not that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, but that they apprehend some particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; as in the sense, which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the sweet, the white, and so on. The inclination which follows this apprehension is called "a sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>." Other things, again, have an inclination towards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but with a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> whereby they perceive the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>; this belongs to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. This is most perfectly inclined towards what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; not, indeed, as if it were merely guided by another towards some particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> only, like things devoid of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, nor towards some particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> only, as things which have only sensitive <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but as inclined towards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in general. Such inclination is termed "will." Accordingly, since the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> by their <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the universal aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, it is manifest that there is a will in them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason</a> surpasses sense in a different way from that in which <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> surpasses reason. <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason</a> surpasses sense according to the diversity of the objects <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; for sense judges of particular objects, while reason judges of universals. Therefore there must be one <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> tending towards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01074a.htm">abstract</a>, which <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> belongs to reason; and another with a tendency towards particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> belongs to sense. But <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and reason differ as to their manner of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>; because the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> by simple intuition, while reason <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> by a process of discursion from one thing to another. Nevertheless by such discursion reason comes to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> learns without it, namely, the universal. Consequently the object presented to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> faculty on the part of reason and on the part of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the same. Therefore in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who are purely <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, there is no <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> higher than the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although the name of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> part is derived from seeking things not yet possessed, yet the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> part reaches out not to these things only, but also to many other things; thus the name of a stone [lapis] is derived from injuring the foot [laesione pedis], though not this alone belongs to a stone. In the same way the irascible faculty is so denominated from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> [ira]; though at the same time there are several other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> in it, as hope, daring, and the rest.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is called a mover which is moved, according as to will and to understand are termed movements of a kind; and there is nothing to prevent movement of this kind from <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, since such movement is the act of a perfect agent, as stated in De Anima iii, text. 28.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether in the angels the will differs from the intellect?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does not differ from the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is more simple than a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> body. But a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> body is inclined through its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> towards its end, which is its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore much more so is the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> form is either the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in which he subsists, or else it is some <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> within his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> inclines towards the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> through his own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, or through an intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But such inclination towards the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> does not differ from his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the object of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, while the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> differ, not really but only <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> [Cf. 16, 4]. Therefore will and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> are not really different.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the distinction of common and proper does not differentiate the faculties; for the same power of sight perceives color and whiteness. But the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> seem to be mutually related as common to particular; for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> is a particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, to wit, of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, whose object is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, does not differ from the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, whose object is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The will in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> regards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things only, while their <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> regards both <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and bad things, for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> both. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> is distinct from their <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is a special faculty or power, which is neither their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> nor their <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. That it is not their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is manifest from this, that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of a thing is completely comprised within it: whatever, then, extends to anything beyond it, is not its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Hence we see in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> bodies that the inclination to being does not come from anything superadded to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, but from the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> which desires being before possessing it, and from the form which keeps it in such being when once it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>. But the inclination towards something extrinsic comes from something superadded to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; as tendency to a place comes from gravity or lightness, while the inclination to make something like itself comes from the active <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>.

<p>Now the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> tendency towards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Consequently there alone are <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and will identified where all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is contained within the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of him who wills; that is to say, in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who wills nothing beyond Himself except on account of His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. This cannot be said of any creature, because <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is quite foreign to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> thing. Accordingly, neither the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, nor that of any creature, can be the same thing as its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p>In like manner neither can the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> be the same thing as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> or <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Because <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> comes about in so far as the object <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> is within the knower; consequently the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> extends itself to what is outside it, according as what, in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, is outside it is disposed to be somehow within it. On the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> goes out to what is beyond it, according as by a kind of inclination it tends, in a manner, to what is outside it. Now it belongs to one faculty to have within itself something which is outside it, and to another faculty to tend to what is outside it. Consequently <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will must <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> be different powers in every creature. It is not so with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for He has within Himself universal being, and the universal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore both <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will are His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> body is moved to its own being by its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form: while it is inclined to something outside by something additional, as has been said.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Faculties are not differentiated by any material difference of their objects, but according to their formal distinction, which is taken from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the object as such. Consequently the diversity derived from the notion of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> suffices for the difference of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> from will.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Because the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> are really convertible, it follows that the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is apprehended by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> as something <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; while the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> is desired by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as something <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Nevertheless, the diversity of their aspects is sufficient for diversifying the faculties, as was said above (ad 2).

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether there is free-will in the angels?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is no <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For the act of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is to choose. But there can be no choice with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, because choice is "the desire of something after taking counsel," while counsel is "a kind of inquiry," as stated in Ethic. iii, 3. But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>' <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not the result of inquiring, for this belongs to the discursiveness of reason. Therefore it appears that there is no <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> implies indifference to alternatives. But in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> on the part of their <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> there is no such indifference; because, as was observed already (58, 5), their <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not deceived as to things which are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> intelligible to them. Therefore neither on the part of their <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> faculty can there be <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> endowments of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> belong to them according to degrees of more or less; because in the higher <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is more perfect than in the lower. But the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> does not admit of degrees. Therefore there is no <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> in them.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">Free-will</a> is part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> dignity. But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>' dignity surpasses that of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Therefore, since <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is in men, with much more reason is it in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some things there are which act, not from any previous judgment, but, as it were, moved and made to act by others; just as the arrow is directed to the target by the archer. Others act from some kind of judgment; but not from <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, such as irrational animals; for the sheep flies from the wolf by a kind of judgment whereby it esteems it to be hurtful to itself: such a judgment is not a free one, but implanted by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Only an agent endowed with an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can act with a judgment which is free, in so far as it apprehends the common note of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>; from which it can judge this or the other thing to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Consequently, wherever there is <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, there is <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. It is therefore manifest that just as there is <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, so is there <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and in a higher degree of perfection than in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> is speaking of choice, as it is in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. As a man's estimate in speculative matters differs from an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> in this, that the one needs not to inquire, while the other does so need; so is it in practical matters. Hence there is choice in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, yet not with the inquisitive deliberation of counsel, but by the sudden acceptance of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As was observed already (2), <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is effected by the presence of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> within the knower. Now it is a mark of imperfection in anything not to have within it what it should <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> have. Consequently an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> would not be perfect in his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, if his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> were not determined to every <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which he can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>. But the act of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> faculty comes of this, that the affection is directed to something outside. Yet the perfection of a thing does not come from everything to which it is inclined, but only from something which is higher than it. Therefore it does not argue imperfection in an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> if his will be not determined with regard to things beneath him; but it would argue imperfection in him, were he to be indeterminate to what is above him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Free-will <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in a nobler manner in the higher <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> than it does in the lower, as also does the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Yet it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that liberty, in so far as the removal of compulsion is considered, is not susceptible of greater and less degree; because privations and negations are not lessened nor increased directly of themselves; but only by their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, or through the addition of some qualification.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether there is an irascible and a concupiscible appetite in the angels?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is an irascible and a <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that in the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> there is "unreasonable fury and wild <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>." But <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has not altered their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore there is an irascible and a <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, love and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> are in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>; while <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, hope, and fear are in the irascible <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. But in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scriptures</a> these things are attributed both to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Therefore there is an irascible and a <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, some <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are said to reside in the irascible <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> and some in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>: thus <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> appear to be in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>, while hope and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> are in the irascible. But these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Therefore there is both a <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> and an irascible <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii, text. 42) that the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> are in the sensitive part, which does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Consequently there is no irascible or <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is not divided into irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>; only the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is so divided. The reason of this is because, since the faculties are distinguished from one another not according to the material but only by the formal distinction of objects, if to any faculty there respond an object according to some common <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, there will be no distinction of faculties according to the diversity of the particular things contained under that common <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>. Just as if the proper object of the power of sight be color as such, then there are not several powers of sight distinguished according to the difference of black and white: whereas if the proper object of any faculty were white, as white, then the faculty of seeing white would be distinguished from the faculty of seeing black.

<p>Now it is quite evident from what has been said (1; 16, 1), that the object of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, otherwise <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> according to the common aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>; nor can there be any <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> except of what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Hence, in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> part, the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is not divided according to the distinction of some particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, as the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is divided, which does not crave for what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> according to its common aspect, but for some particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> object. Accordingly, since there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> only an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, their <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is not distinguished into irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>, but remains undivided; and it is called the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Fury and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> are metaphorically said to be in the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, as <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is sometimes attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;--on account of the resemblance in the effect.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Love and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, in so far as they are <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, are in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, but in so far as they express a simple act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, they are in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> part: in this sense to love is to wish well to anyone; and to be glad is for the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to repose in some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> possessed. Universally speaking, none of these things is said of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as by way of <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>; as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei ix).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a>, as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, is not in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, but in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; because the object of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as delectable to the senses. But the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, which is the object of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, is not of any such kind. For the same reason it must be said that hope does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the irascible <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; because the object of the irascible <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is something arduous belonging to the sensible order, which the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of hope does not regard; since the object of hope is arduous and divine. Temperance, however, considered as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, deals with the desires of sensible pleasures, which belong to the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty. Similarly, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> regulates daring and fear, which reside in the irascible part. Consequently <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, in so far as it is a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, resides in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> part, and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> in the irascible. But they do not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in this manner. For in them there are no <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, nor of fear and daring, to be regulated by <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. But <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is predicated of them according as in moderation they display their will in conformity with the Divine will. Fortitude is likewise attributed to them, in so far as they firmly carry out the Divine will. All of this is done by their will, and not by the irascible or <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.
