<h1>Question 5. Goodness in general</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1005.htm#article1"> Are goodness and being the same really?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1005.htm#article2"> Granted that they differ only in idea, which is prior in thought?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1005.htm#article3"> Granted that being is prior, is every being good?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1005.htm#article4"> To what cause should goodness be reduced?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1005.htm#article5"> Does goodness consist in mode, species, and order?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1005.htm#article6"> Is goodness divided into the virtuous, the useful, and the pleasant?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether goodness differs really from being?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> differs really from being. For <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Hebdom.): "I perceive that in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> the fact that things are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is one thing: that they are is another." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and being really differ.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, nothing can be its own form. "But that is called <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which has the form of being", according to the commentary on De Causis. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> differs really from being.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> can be more or less. But being cannot be more or less. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> differs really from being.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 42) that, "inasmuch as we <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> we are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Goodness and being are really the same, and differ only in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>; which is clear from the following argument. The <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> consists in this, that it is in some way desirable. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. i): "Goodness is what all desire." Now it is clear that a thing is desirable only in so far as it is perfect; for all desire their own perfection. But everything is perfect so far as it is actual. Therefore it is clear that a thing is perfect so far as it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>; for it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> that makes all things actual, as is clear from the foregoing (3, 4; 4, 1). Hence it is clear that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and being are the same really. But <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> presents the aspect of desirableness, which being does not present.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and being are the same really, nevertheless since they differ in thought, they are not predicated of a thing absolutely in the same way. Since being properly signifies that something actually is, and <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a> properly correlates to <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>; a thing is, in consequence, said simply to have being, accordingly as it is primarily distinguished from that which is only in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>; and this is precisely each thing's <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> being. Hence by its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> being, everything is said to have being simply; but by any further <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a> it is said to have being relatively. Thus to be white implies relative being, for to be white does not take a thing out of simply potential being; because only a thing that actually has being can receive this mode of being. But <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> signifies perfection which is desirable; and consequently of ultimate perfection. Hence that which has ultimate perfection is said to be simply <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; but that which has not the ultimate perfection it ought to have (although, in so far as it is at all actual, it has some perfection), is not said to be perfect simply nor <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> simply, but only relatively. In this way, therefore, viewed in its primal (i.e. <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a>) being a thing is said to be simply, and to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> relatively (i.e. in so far as it has being) but viewed in its complete <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a>, a thing is said to be relatively, and to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> simply. Hence the saying of <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> (De Hebrom.), "I perceive that in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> the fact that things are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is one thing; that they are is another," is to be referred to a thing's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> simply, and having being simply. Because, regarded in its primal <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a>, a thing simply <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>; and regarded in its complete <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> simply--in such sort that even in its primal <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a>, it is in some sort <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and even in its complete <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a>, it in some sort has being.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Goodness is a form so far as absolute <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> signifies complete <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Again, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is spoken of as more or less according to a thing's superadded <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a>, for example, as to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether goodness is prior in idea to being?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is prior in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> to being. For names are arranged according to the arrangement of the things signified by the names. But <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. iii) assigned the first place, amongst the other names of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> rather than to His being. Therefore in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is prior to being.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which is the more extensive is prior in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is more extensive than being, because, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> notes (Div. Nom. v), "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> extends to things both <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> and non-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a>; whereas <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> extends to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> things alone." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> prior to being.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, what is the more universal is prior in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> seems to be more universal than being, since <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> has the aspect of desirable; whereas to some non-existence is desirable; for it is said of <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a>: "It were better for him, if that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had not been born" (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse24">Matthew 26:24</a>). Therefore in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is prior to being.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, not only is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> desirable, but life, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and many other things besides. Thus it seems that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is a particular appetible, and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> a universal appetible. Therefore, absolutely, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is prior in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> to being.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said by <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> (De Causis) that "the first of <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things is being."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> being is prior to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. For the meaning signified by the name of a thing is that which the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> conceives of the thing and intends by the word that stands for it. Therefore, that is prior in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, which is first conceived by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Now the first thing conceived by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is being; because everything is knowable only inasmuch as it is in <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a>. Hence, being is the proper object of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and is primarily intelligible; as sound is that which is primarily audible. Therefore in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> being is prior to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> discusses the Divine Names (Div. Nom. i, iii) as implying some <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causal</a> relation in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for we name <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as he says, from creatures, as a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> from its effects. But <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, since it has the aspect of desirable, implies the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, the causality of which is first among <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, since an agent does not act except for some end; and by an agent <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is moved to its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Hence the end is called the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. Thus <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, as a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, is prior to being, as is the end to the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Therefore among the names signifying the divine causality, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> precedes being. Again, according to the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a>, who, through not distinguishing primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> from privation, said that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> was non-being, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is more extensively participated than being; for primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> participates in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> as tending to it, for all seek their like; but it does not participate in being, since it is presumed to be non-being. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says that "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> extends to non-existence" (Div. Nom. v).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The same solution is applied to this objection. Or it may be said that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> extends to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> and non-existing things, not so far as it can be predicated of them, but so far as it can <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> them -- if, indeed, by non-existence we understand not simply those things which do not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, but those which are potential, and not actual. For <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> has the aspect of the end, in which not only actual things find their completion, but also towards which tend even those things which are not actual, but merely potential. Now being implies the habitude of a <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">formal</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> only, either inherent or exemplar; and its causality does not extend save to those things which are actual.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Non-being is desirable, not of itself, but only relatively--i.e. inasmuch as the removal of an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, which can only be removed by non-being, is desirable. Now the removal of an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> cannot be desirable, except so far as this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> deprives a thing of some being. Therefore being is desirable of itself; and non-being only relatively, inasmuch as one seeks some mode of being of which one cannot bear to be deprived; thus even non-being can be spoken of as relatively <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Life, wisdom, and the like, are desirable only so far as they are actual. Hence, in each one of them some sort of being is desired. And thus nothing can be desired except being; and consequently nothing is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> except being.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether every being is good?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that not every being is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is something superadded to being, as is clear from  1. But whatever is added to being limits it; as <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, etc. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> limits being. Therefore not every being is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: "Woe to you that call <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>" (<a href="../bible/isa005.htm#verse20">Isaiah 5:20</a>). But some things are called <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore not every being is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> implies desirability. Now primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> does not imply desirability, but rather that which desires. Therefore primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> does not contain the formality of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Therefore not every being is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> notes (Metaph. iii) that "in mathematics <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> does not exist." But mathematics are entities; otherwise there would be no science of mathematics. Therefore not every being is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Every being that is not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> creature. Now every creature of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> (<a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse4">1 Timothy 4:4</a>): and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the greatest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore every being is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Every being, as being, is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. For all being, as being, has <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a> and is in some way perfect; since every act implies some sort of perfection; and perfection implies desirability and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, as is clear from  1. Hence it follows that every being as such is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">Substance</a>, <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, and everything included in them, limit being by applying it to some <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> or <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now in this sense, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> does not add anything to being beyond the aspect of desirability and perfection, which is also proper to being, whatever kind of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> it may be. Hence <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> does not limit being.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> No being can be spoken of as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, formally as being, but only so far as it lacks being. Thus a man is said to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, because he lacks some <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and an eye is said to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, because it lacks the power to see well.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> has only <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a> being, so it is only <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Although, according to the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a>, primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> may be said to be a non-being on account of the privation attaching to it, nevertheless, it does participate to a certain extent in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, viz. by its relation to, or aptitude for, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Consequently, to be desirable is not its property, but to desire.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Mathematical entities do not subsist as realities; because they would be in some sort <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> if they subsisted; but they have only logical <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, inasmuch as they are abstracted from motion and <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; thus they cannot have the aspect of an end, which itself has the aspect of moving another. Nor is it repugnant that there should be in some logical entity neither <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> nor form of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>; since the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of being is prior to the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, as was said in the  preceding article.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether goodness has the aspect of a final cause?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> has not the aspect of a final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but rather of the other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. For, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv), "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">Goodness</a> is praised as beauty." But beauty has the aspect of a <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">formal</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> has the aspect of a <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">formal</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is self-diffusive; for <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is that whereby all things subsist, and are. But to be self-giving implies the aspect of an efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> has the aspect of an efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 31) that "we <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." But we owe our <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> implies the aspect of an efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Phys. ii) that "that is to be considered as the end and the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of other things, for the sake of which something is." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> has the aspect of a final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is that which all things desire, and since this has the aspect of an end, it is clear that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> implies the aspect of an end. Nevertheless, the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> presupposes the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of an efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and also of a <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">formal</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. For we see that what is first in <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a>, is last in the thing <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a>. Fire, e.g. heats first of all before it reproduces the form of fire; though the heat in the fire follows from its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form. Now in <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a>, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and the end come first, both of which move the agent to act; secondly, the action of the agent moving to the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>; thirdly, comes the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Hence in that which is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> the converse ought to take place, so that there should be first, the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> whereby it is a being; secondly, we consider in it its effective power, whereby it is perfect in being, for a thing is perfect when it can reproduce its like, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Meteor. iv); thirdly, there follows the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">formality</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> which is the basic principle of its perfection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Beauty and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> in a thing are identical fundamentally; for they are based upon the same thing, namely, the form; and consequently <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is praised as beauty. But they differ <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a>, for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> properly relates to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> (<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> being what all things desire); and therefore it has the aspect of an end (the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> being a kind of movement towards a thing). On the other hand, beauty relates to the cognitive faculty; for beautiful things are those which please when seen. Hence beauty consists in due proportion; for the senses delight in things duly proportioned, as in what is after their own kind--because even sense is a sort of reason, just as is every cognitive faculty. Now since <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is by assimilation, and similarity relates to form, beauty properly belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">formal</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Goodness is described as self-diffusive in the sense that an end is said to move.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> He who has a <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is said to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, so far as he has a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; because it is by our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> that we employ whatever powers we may have. Hence a man is said to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, not by his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">understanding</a>; but by his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> relates to the end as to its proper object. Thus the saying, "we <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" has reference to the final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the essence of goodness consists in mode, species and order?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> does not consist in mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order. For <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and being differ <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a>. But mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order seem to belong to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of being, for it is written: "Thou hast ordered all things in measure, and number, and weight" (<a href="../bible/wis011.htm#verse21">Wisdom 11:21</a>). And to these three can be reduced <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, mode and order, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. iv, 3): "Measure fixes the mode of everything, number gives it its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and weight gives it rest and stability." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> does not consist in mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order are themselves <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore if the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> consists in mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order, then every mode must have its own mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order. The same would be the case with <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order in endless succession.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is the privation of mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order. But <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not the total absence of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> does not consist in mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, that wherein consists the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> cannot be spoken of as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Yet we can speak of an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> does not consist in mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by weight, number and measure, as appears from the quotation from <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>. But not every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thing has weight, number and measure; for <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (Hexam. i, 9): "It is of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of light not to have been created in number, weight and measure." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> does not consist in mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Nat. Boni. iii): "These three--mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order--as common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, are in everything <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has made; thus, where these three abound the things are very <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; where they are less, the things are less <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; where they do not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> at all, there can be nothing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." But this would not be unless the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> consisted in them. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> consists in mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Everything is said to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> so far as it is perfect; for in that way only is it desirable (as shown above 1, 3). Now a thing is said to be perfect if it lacks nothing according to the mode of its perfection. But since everything is what it is by its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> (and since the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> presupposes certain things, and from the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> certain things necessarily follow), in order for a thing to be perfect and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> it must have a <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, together with all that precedes and follows upon that <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> presupposes determination or commensuration of its principles, whether material or efficient, and this is signified by the mode: hence it is said that the measure marks the mode. But the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> itself is signified by the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; for everything is placed in its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> by its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Hence the number is said to give the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, for definitions signifying <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are like numbers, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. x); for as a unit added to, or taken from a number, changes its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, so a difference added to, or taken from a definition, changes its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Further, upon the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> follows an inclination to the end, or to an action, or something of the sort; for everything, in so far as it is in act, acts and tends towards that which is in accordance with its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>; and this belongs to weight and order. Hence the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, so far as it consists in perfection, consists also in mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> These three only follow upon being, so far as it is perfect, and according to this perfection is it <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order are said to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and to be beings, not as though they themselves were subsistences, but because it is through them that other things are both beings and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Hence they have no need of other things whereby they are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: for they are spoken of as <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, not as though formally constituted so by something else, but as formally constituting others <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: thus whiteness is not said to be a being as though it were by anything else; but because, by it, something else has <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> being, as an object that is white.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Every being is due to some form. Hence, according to every being of a thing is its mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, order. Thus, a man has a mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order as he is white, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, learned and so on; according to everything predicated of him. But <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> deprives a thing of some sort of being, as blindness deprives us of that being which is sight; yet it does not destroy every mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order, but only such as follow upon the being of sight.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Nat. Boni. xxiii), "Every mode, as mode, is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" (and the same can be said of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order). "But an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order are so called as being less than they ought to be, or as not belonging to that which they ought to belong. Therefore they are called <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, because they are out of place and incongruous."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of light is spoken of as being without number, weight and measure, not absolutely, but in comparison with corporeal things, because the power of light extends to all corporeal things; inasmuch as it is an active <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of the first body that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> change, i.e. the heavens.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether goodness is rightly divided into the virtuous, the useful and the pleasant?</h2>

<p><span class="stiki">"Bonum honestum" is the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> considered as fitting. (cf. II-II, 141, 3; II-II, 145)</span>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is not rightly divided into the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, the useful and the pleasant. For <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is divided by the ten predicaments, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. i). But the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, the useful and the pleasant can be found under one predicament. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is not rightly divided by them.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every division is made by opposites. But these three do not seem to be opposites; for the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> is pleasing, and no wickedness is useful; whereas this ought to be the case if the division were made by opposites, for then the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> and the useful would be opposed; and Tully speaks of this (De Offic. ii). Therefore this division is incorrect.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, where one thing is on account of another, there is only one thing. But the useful is not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, except so far as it is pleasing and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>. Therefore the useful ought not to divided against the pleasant and the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> makes use of this division of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> (De Offic. i, 9)

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> This division properly concerns <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. But if we consider the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> from a higher and more universal point of view, we shall find that this division properly concerns <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> as such. For everything is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> so far as it is desirable, and is a term of the movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; the term of whose movement can be seen from a consideration of the movement of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> body. Now the movement of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> body is terminated by the end absolutely; and relatively by the means through which it comes to the end, where the movement ceases; so a thing is called a term of movement, so far as it terminates any part of that movement. Now the ultimate term of movement can be taken in two ways, either as the thing itself towards which it tends, e.g. a place or form; or a state of rest in that thing. Thus, in the movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, the thing desired that terminates the movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> relatively, as a means by which something tends towards another, is called the useful; but that sought after as the last thing absolutely terminating the movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, as a thing towards which for its own sake the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> tends, is called the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>; for the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> is that which is desired for its own sake; but that which terminates the movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> in the form of rest in the thing desired, is called the pleasant.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Goodness, so far as it is identical with being, is divided by the ten predicaments. But this division belongs to it according to its proper formality.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This division is not by opposite things; but by opposite aspects. Now those things are called pleasing which have no other formality under which they are desirable except the pleasant, being sometimes hurtful and contrary to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Whereas the useful applies to such as have nothing desirable in themselves, but are desired only as helpful to something further, as the taking of bitter medicine; while the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> is predicated of such as are desirable in themselves.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Goodness is not divided into these three as something univocal to be predicated equally of them all; but as something analogical to be predicated of them according to priority and posteriority. Hence it is predicated chiefly of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>; then of the pleasant; and lastly of the useful.
