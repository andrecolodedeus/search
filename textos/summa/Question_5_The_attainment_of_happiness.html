<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether man can attain happiness?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot attain <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. For just as the rational is above the sensible <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, so the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> is above the rational, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> declares (Div. Nom. iv, vi, vii) in several passages. But irrational animals that have the sensitive <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> only, cannot attain the end of the rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore neither can <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who is of rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, attain the end of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which is Happiness.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">True</a> Happiness consists in seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is pure Truth. But from his very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> considers <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in material things: wherefore "he understands the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in the phantasm" (De Anima iii, 7). Therefore he cannot attain Happiness.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, Happiness consists in attaining the Sovereign Good. But we cannot arrive at the top without surmounting the middle. Since, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> through which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot mount is midway between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; it seems that he cannot attain Happiness.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa093.htm#verse12">Psalm 93:12</a>): "Blessed is the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whom Thou shalt instruct, O Lord."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Happiness is the attainment of the Perfect Good. Whoever, therefore, is capable of the Perfect Good can attain Happiness. Now, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is capable of the Perfect Good, is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> both because his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can apprehend the universal and perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and because his will can desire it. And therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can attain Happiness. This can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> again from the fact that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is capable of seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated in I, 12, 1: in which vision, as we stated above (Question 3, Article 8) <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> perfect Happiness consists.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The rational exceeds the sensitive <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, otherwise than the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> surpasses the rational. For the rational exceeds the sensitive <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in respect of the object of its <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: since the senses have no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> whatever of the universal, whereas the reason has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> thereof. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> surpasses the rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as to the mode of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the same intelligible <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> grasps forthwith the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which the rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> reaches by the inquiry of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, as was made clear in the I, 58, 3; I, 79, 8. Therefore reason arrives by a kind of movement at that which the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> grasps. Consequently the rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> can attain Happiness, which is the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: but otherwise than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Because the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> attained it forthwith after the beginning of their creation: whereas <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> attains if after a time. But the sensitive <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> can nowise attain this end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> To <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the present state of life the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> way of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> intelligible <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is by means of phantasms. But after this state of life, he has another <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> way, as was stated in the I, 84, 7; I, 89, 1.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Man cannot surmount the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in the degree of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> so as to be above them <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>. But he can surmount them by an operation of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, by understanding that there is above the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> something that makes men <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>; and when he has attained it, he will be perfectly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether one man can be happier than another?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happier</a> than another. For Happiness is "the reward of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. i, 9). But equal reward is given for all the works of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; because it is written (<a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse10">Matthew 20:10</a>) that all who labor in the vineyard "received every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> a penny"; for, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xix in Evang.), "each was equally rewarded with <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>." Therefore one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happier</a> than another.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, Happiness is the <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a>. But nothing can surpass the supreme. Therefore one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> Happiness cannot be surpassed by another's.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, since Happiness is "the perfect and sufficient <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" (Ethic. i, 7) it brings rest to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> desire. But his desire is not at rest, if he yet lacks some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that can be got. And if he lack nothing that he can get, there can be no still greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore either <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>; or, if he be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, no other Happiness can be greater.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse2">John 14:2</a>): "In My Father's house there are many mansions"; which, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Tract. lxvii in Joan.) signify "the diverse dignities of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> in the one <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>." But the dignity of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> which is given according to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, is Happiness itself. Therefore there are diverse degrees of Happiness, and Happiness is not equally in all.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1, 8; 2, 7), Happiness implies two things, to wit, the last end itself, i.e. the Sovereign Good; and the attainment or enjoyment of that same Good. As to that Good itself, Which is the object and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of Happiness, one Happiness cannot be greater than another, since there is but one Sovereign Good, namely, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by enjoying Whom, men are made <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>. But as to the attainment or enjoyment of this Good, one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happier</a> than another; because the more a man enjoys this Good the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happier</a> he is. Now, that one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> enjoys <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more than another, happens through his being better disposed or ordered to the enjoyment of Him. And in this sense one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happier</a> than another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The one penny signifies that Happiness is one in its object. But the many mansions signify the manifold Happiness in the divers degrees of enjoyment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Happiness is said to be the <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a>, inasmuch as it is the perfect possession or enjoyment of the Supreme Good.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> None of the Blessed lacks any desirable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; since they have the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">Infinite</a> Good Itself, Which is "the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enarr. in Ps. 134). But one is said to be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happier</a> than another, by reason of diverse participation of the same <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. And the addition of other goods does not increase Happiness, since <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. v, 4): "He who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Thee, and others besides, is not the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happier</a> for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> them, but is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> Thee alone."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether one can be happy in this life?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that Happiness can be had in this life. For it is written (<a href="../bible/psa118.htm#verse1">Psalm 118:1</a>): "Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the Lord." But this happens in this life. Therefore one can be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> in this life.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, imperfect participation in the Sovereign Good does not destroy the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of Happiness, otherwise one would not be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happier</a> than another. But men can participate in the Sovereign Good in this life, by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, albeit imperfectly. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> in this life.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, what is said by many cannot be altogether <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>: since what is in many, comes, apparently, from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> does not fail altogether. Now many say that Happiness can be had in this life, as appears from <a href="../bible/psa143.htm#verse15">Psalm 143:15</a>: "They have called the people <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> that hath these things," to wit, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things in this life. Therefore one can be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> in this life.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/job014.htm#verse1">Job 14:1</a>): "Man born of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, living for a short time, is filled with many miseries." But Happiness excludes misery. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> in this life.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A certain participation of Happiness can be had in this life: but perfect and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Happiness cannot be had in this life. This may be seen from a twofold consideration.

<p>First, from the general notion of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. For since <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is a "perfect and sufficient <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," it excludes every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and fulfils every desire. But in this life every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> cannot be excluded. For this present life is subject to many unavoidable <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>; to <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> on the part of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; to inordinate affection on the part of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, and to many penalties on the part of the body; as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> sets forth in De Civ. Dei xix, 4. Likewise neither can the desire for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> be satiated in this life. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> desires the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which he has, to be abiding. Now the goods of the present life pass away; since life itself passes away, which we <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> desire to have, and would wish to hold abidingly, for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> shrinks from death. Wherefore it is impossible to have <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Happiness in this life.

<p>Secondly, from a consideration of the specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of Happiness, viz. the vision of the Divine Essence, which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot obtain in this life, as was shown in the I, 12, 11. Hence it is evident that none can attain <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and perfect Happiness in this life.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Some are said to be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> in this life, either on account of the hope of obtaining Happiness in the life to come, according to <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse24">Romans 8:24</a>: "We are saved by hope"; or on account of a certain participation of Happiness, by reason of a kind of enjoyment of the Sovereign Good.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The imperfection of participated Happiness is due to one of two <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. First, on the part of the object of Happiness, which is not seen in Its Essence: and this imperfection destroys the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Happiness. Secondly, the imperfection may be on the part of the participator, who indeed attains the object of Happiness, in itself, namely, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: imperfectly, however, in comparison with the way in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> enjoys Himself. This imperfection does not destroy the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of Happiness; because, since Happiness is an operation, as stated above (Question 3, Article 2), the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of Happiness is taken from the object, which specifies the act, and not from the subject.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Men esteem that there is some kind of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> to be had in this life, on account of a certain likeness to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Happiness. And thus they do not fail altogether in their estimate.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether happiness once had can be lost?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that Happiness can be lost. For Happiness is a perfection. But every perfection is in the thing perfected according to the mode of the latter. Since then <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is, by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, changeable, it seems that Happiness is participated by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in a changeable manner. And consequently it seems that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can lose Happiness.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, Happiness consists in an act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is subject to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> can be directed to opposites. Therefore it seems that it can desist from the operation whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is made <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>: and thus <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will cease to be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the end corresponds to the beginning. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> Happiness has a beginning, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was not always <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>. Therefore it seems that it has an end.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse46">Matthew 25:46</a>) of the righteous that "they shall god . . . into life everlasting," which, as above stated (2), is the Happiness of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. Now what is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> ceases not. Therefore Happiness cannot be lost.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> If we speak of imperfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, such as can be had in this life, in this sense it can be lost. This is clear of contemplative <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, which is lost either by forgetfulness, for instance, when <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is lost through sickness; or again by certain occupations, whereby a man is altogether withdrawn from <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>.

<p>This is also clear of active <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>: since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will can be changed so as to fall to <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> from the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, in whose act that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> principally consists. If, however, the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> remain unimpaired, outward changes can indeed disturb such like <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, in so far as they hinder many acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; but they cannot take it away altogether because there still remains an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> bears these trials in a praiseworthy manner. And since the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of this life can be lost, a circumstance that appears to be contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, therefore did the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> state (Ethic. i, 10) that some are <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> in this life, not simply, but "as men," whose <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is subject to change.

<p>But if we speak of that perfect Happiness which we await after this life, it must be observed that <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> (Peri Archon. ii, 3), following the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of certain <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a>, held that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can become unhappy after the final Happiness.

<p>This, however, is evidently <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, for two reasons. First, from the general notion of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. For since <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is the "perfect and sufficient <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," it must needs set <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> desire at rest and exclude every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> desires to hold to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that he has, and to have the surety of his holding: else he must of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> be troubled with the fear of losing it, or with the sorrow of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that he will lose it. Therefore it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Happiness that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> have the assured opinion of never losing the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that he possesses. If this opinion be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, it follows that he never will lose <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>: but if it be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, it is in itself an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that he should have a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinion: because the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> is the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, just as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> is its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as stated in Ethic. vi, 2. Consequently he will no longer be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, if <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> be in him.

<p>Secondly, it is again evident if we consider the specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of Happiness. For it has been shown above (Question 3, Article 8) that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> perfect Happiness consists in the vision of the Divine Essence. Now it is impossible for anyone seeing the Divine Essence, to wish not to see It. Because every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that one possesses and yet wishes to be without, is either insufficient, something more sufficing being desired in its stead; or else has some inconvenience attached to it, by reason of which it becomes wearisome. But the vision of the Divine Essence fills the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, since it unites it to the source of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>; hence it is written (<a href="../bible/psa016.htm#verse15">Psalm 16:15</a>): "I shall be satisfied when Thy <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> shall appear"; and (<a href="../bible/wis007.htm#verse11">Wisdom 7:11</a>): "All <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things came to me together with her," i.e. with the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of wisdom. In like manner neither has it any inconvenience attached to it; because it is written of the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of wisdom (<a href="../bible/wis008.htm#verse16">Wisdom 8:16</a>): "Her conversation hath no bitterness, nor her company any tediousness." It is thus evident that the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot forsake Happiness of his own accord. Moreover, neither can he lose Happiness, through <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> taking it away from him. Because, since the withdrawal of Happiness is a punishment, it cannot be enforced by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the just Judge, except for some fault; and he that sees <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot fall into a fault, since rectitude of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, results from that vision as was shown above (Question 4, Article 4). Nor again can it be withdrawn by any other agent. Because the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> that is united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is raised above all other things: and consequently no other agent can sever the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> from that union. Therefore it seems unreasonable that as time goes on, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should pass from <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> to misery, and vice versa; because such like vicissitudes of time can only be for such things as are subject to time and movement.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Happiness is consummate perfection, which excludes every defect from the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>. And therefore whoever has <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> has it altogether unchangeably: this is done by the Divine power, which raises <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to the participation of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> which transcends all change.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The will can be directed to opposites, in things which are ordained to the end; but it is ordained, of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, to the last end. This is evident from the fact that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is unable not to wish to be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Happiness has a beginning owing to the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the participator: but it has no end by reason of the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, the participation of which makes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>. Hence the beginning of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is from one <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, its endlessness is from another.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether man can attain happiness by his natural powers?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can attain Happiness by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers. For <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> does not fail in <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> things. But nothing is so <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as that by which he attains the last end. Therefore this is not lacking to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can attain Happiness by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is more noble than irrational creatures, it seems that he must be better equipped than they. But irrational creatures can attain their end by their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers. Much more therefore can <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> attain Happiness by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, Happiness is a "perfect operation," according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vii, 13). Now the beginning of a thing belongs to the same principle as the perfecting thereof. Since, therefore, the imperfect operation, which is as the beginning in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> operations, is subject to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power, whereby he is master of his own actions; it seems that he can attain to perfect operation, i.e. Happiness, by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> the principle of his action, by his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will. But final Happiness prepared for the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, surpasses the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; for the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse9">1 Corinthians 2:9</a>) "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, what things <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath prepared for them that love Him." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot attain Happiness by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Imperfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> that can be had in this life, can be acquired by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers, in the same way as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, in whose operation it consists: on this point we shall speak further on (63). But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> perfect Happiness, as stated above (Question 3, Article 8), consists in the vision of the Divine Essence. Now the vision of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> Essence surpasses the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> not only of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but also of every creature, as was shown in the I, 12, 4. For the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of every creature is in keeping with the mode of his <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>: thus it is said of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> (De Causis; Prop. viii) that "it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> things that are above it, and things that are below it, according to the mode of its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>." But every <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that is according to the mode of <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, falls short of the vision of the Divine Essence, which <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> surpasses all <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Consequently neither <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, nor any creature, can attain final Happiness by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Just as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> does not fail <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in necessaries, although it has not provided him with weapons and clothing, as it provided other animals, because it gave him reason and hands, with which he is able to get these things for himself; so neither did it fail <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in things <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, although it gave him not the wherewithal to attain Happiness: since this it could not do. But it did give him <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, with which he can turn to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that He may make him <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>. "For what we do by means of our friends, is done, in a sense, by ourselves" (Ethic. iii, 3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that can attain perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, although it needs help from without in order to attain it, is of more noble <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> than a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which cannot attain perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but attains some imperfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, although it need no help from without in order to attain it, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Coel. ii, 12). Thus he is better disposed to health who can attain perfect health, albeit by means of medicine, than he who can attain but imperfect health, without the help of medicine. And therefore the rational creature, which can attain the perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, but needs the Divine assistance for the purpose, is more perfect than the irrational creature, which is not capable of attaining this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but attains some imperfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> When imperfect and perfect are of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, they can be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the same power. But this does not follow of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, if they be of different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>: for not everything, that can <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the disposition of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, can produce the final perfection. Now the imperfect operation, which is subject to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power, is not of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> as that perfect operation which is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>: since operation takes its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from its object. Consequently the argument does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether man attains happiness through the action of some higher creature?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can be made <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> through the action of some higher creature, viz. an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. For since we observe a twofold order in things--one, of the parts of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> to one another, the other, of the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> to a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is outside the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>; the former order is ordained to the second as to its end (Metaph. xii, 10). Thus the mutual order of the parts of an army is dependent on the order of the parts of an army is dependent on the order of the whole army to the general. But the mutual order of the parts of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> consists in the higher creatures acting on the lower, as stated in the I, 109, 02: while <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in the order of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is outside the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, i.e. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is made <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, through a higher creature, viz. an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, acting on him.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which is such in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, can be reduced to act, by that which is such actually: thus what is <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a> hot, is made actually hot, by something that is actually hot. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>. Therefore he can be made actually <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who is actually <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, Happiness consists in an operation of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> as stated above (Question 3, Article 4). But an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can enlighten <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> as shown in the I, 111, 1. Therefore an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can make a man <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa083.htm#verse12">Psalm 83:12</a>): "The Lord will give <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since every creature is subject to the laws of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, from the very fact that its power and action are limited: that which surpasses <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, cannot be done by the power of any creature. Consequently if anything need to be done that is above <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it is done by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> immediately; such as raising the dead to life, restoring sight to the blind, and such like. Now it has been shown above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>) that Happiness is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> surpassing <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore it is impossible that it be bestowed through the action of any creature: but by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> made <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, if we speak of perfect Happiness. If, however, we speak of imperfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, the same is to be said of it as of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, in whose act it consists.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It often happens in the case of active powers ordained to one another, that it belongs to the highest power to reach the last end, while the lower powers contribute to the attainment of that last end, by <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> a disposition thereto: thus to the art of sailing, which commands the art of shipbuilding, it belongs to use a ship for the end for which it was made. Thus, too, in the order of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is indeed helped by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in the attainment of his last end, in respect of certain preliminary dispositions thereto: whereas he attains the last end itself through the First Agent, which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When a form <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> perfectly and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> in something, it can be the principle of action on something else: for instance a hot thing heats through heat. But if a form <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in something imperfectly, and not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, it cannot be the principle whereby it is communicated to something else: thus the "<a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>" of color which is in the pupil, cannot make a thing white; nor indeed can everything enlightened or heated give heat or light to something else; for if they could, enlightening and heating would go on to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>. But the light of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, whereby <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is seen, is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> perfectly and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>; whereas in any creature, it is imperfectly and by likeness or participation. Consequently no creature can communicate its Happiness to another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> enlightens the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of a man or of a lower <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, as to certain notions of the Divine works: but not as to the vision of the Divine Essence, as was stated in the I, 106, 1: since in order to see this, all are immediately enlightened by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether any good works are necessary that man may receive happiness from God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that no works of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that he may obtain Happiness from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is an agent of <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power, He requires before acting, neither <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, nor disposition of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but can forthwith produce the whole effect. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> works, since they are not required for Happiness, as the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> thereof, as stated above (<a href="#6">Article 6</a>), can be required only as dispositions thereto. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who does not require dispositions before acting, bestows Happiness without any previous works.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the immediate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of Happiness, so is He the immediate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> first established <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, He produced creatures without any previous disposition or action on the part of the creature, but made each one perfect forthwith in its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Therefore it seems that He bestows Happiness on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> without any previous works.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse6">Romans 4:6</a>) that Happiness is of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> "to whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> reputeth <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> without works." Therefore no works of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for attaining Happiness.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse17">John 13:17</a>): "If you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> these things, you shall be blessed if you do them." Therefore Happiness is obtained through works.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Rectitude of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as stated above (Question 4, Article 4), is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for Happiness; since it is nothing else than the right order of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to the last end; and it is therefore <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for obtaining the end, just as the right disposition of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, in order to receive the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. But this does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that any work of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> need precede his Happiness: for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> could make a will having a right tendency to the end, and at the same time attaining the end; just as sometimes He disposes <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and at the same time introduces the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. But the order of Divine wisdom demands that it should not be thus; for as is stated in De Coel. ii, 12, "of those things that have a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> capacity for the perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, one has it without movement, some by one movement, some by several." Now to possess the perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> without movement, belongs to that which has it <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>: and to have Happiness <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. Therefore it belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone not to be moved towards Happiness by any previous operation. Now since Happiness surpasses every <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, no pure creature can becomingly gain Happiness, without the movement of operation, whereby it tends thereto. But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, who is above <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order, obtained it, according to the order of Divine wisdom, by one movement of a <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> work, as was explained in the I, 62, 5; whereas <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> obtains it by many movements of works which are called <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>. Wherefore also according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. i, 9), <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is the reward of works of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Works are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in order to gain Happiness; not on account of the insufficiency of the Divine power which bestows Happiness, but that the order in things be observed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> produced the first creatures so that they are perfect forthwith, without any previous disposition or operation of the creature; because He instituted the first <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> of the various <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, that through them <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> might be propagated to their progeny. In like manner, because Happiness was to be bestowed on others through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Man, "Who," according to <a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse10">Hebrews 2:10</a>, "had brought many children into <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>"; therefore, from the very beginning of His conception, His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, without any previous <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> operation. But this is peculiar to Him: for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> avails <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> children for the gaining of Happiness, though they have no <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> of their own; because by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> they are made members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> is speaking of the Happiness of Hope, which is bestowed on us by <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, which is not given on account of previous works. For <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not a term of movement, as Happiness is; rather is it the principle of the movement that tends towards Happiness.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether every man desires happiness?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that not all desire Happiness. For no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can desire what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not; since the apprehended <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is the object of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> (De Anima iii, 10). But many <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what Happiness is. This is evident from the fact that, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiii, 4), "some thought that Happiness consists in pleasures of the body; some, in a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; some in other things." Therefore not all desire Happiness.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of Happiness is the vision of the Divine Essence, as stated above (Question 3, Article 8). But some consider it impossible for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to see the Divine Essence; wherefore they desire it not. Therefore all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> do not desire Happiness.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiii, 5) that "<a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> is he who has all he desires, and desires nothing amiss." But all do not desire this; for some desire certain things amiss, and yet they wish to desire such things. Therefore all do not desire Happiness.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiii, 3): "If that actor had said: 'You all wish to be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>; you do not wish to be unhappy,' he would have said that which none would have failed to acknowledge in his will." Therefore everyone desires to be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Happiness can be considered in two ways. First according to the general notion of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>: and thus, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> desires <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. For the general notion of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in the perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as stated above (3,4). But since <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, the perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of a man is that which entirely satisfies his will. Consequently to desire <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is nothing else than to desire that one's will be satisfied. And this everyone desires. Secondly we may speak of Happiness according to its specific notion, as to that in which it consists. And thus all do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Happiness; because they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not in what thing the general notion of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is found. And consequently, in this respect, not all desire it. Wherefore the reply to the first Objection is clear.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Since the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> follows the apprehension of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> or reason; just as it happens that where there is no real distinction, there may be a distinction according to the consideration of reason; so does it happen that one and the same thing is desired in one way, and not desired in another. So that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> may be considered as the final and perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is the general notion of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>: and thus the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> and of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> tends thereto, as stated above. Again it can be considered under other special aspects, either on the part of the operation itself, or on the part of the operating power, or on the part of the object; and thus the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does not tend thereto of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This definition of Happiness given by some--"Happy is the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that has all he desires," or, "whose every wish is fulfilled" is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and adequate definition; but an inadequate definition if understood in another. For if we understand it simply of all that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> desires by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, thus it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that he who has all that he desires, is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>: since nothing satisfies <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> desire, except the perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is Happiness. But if we understand it of those things that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> desires according to the apprehension of the reason, thus it does not belong to Happiness, to have certain things that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> desires; rather does it belong to unhappiness, in so far as the possession of such things hinders <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from having all that he desires <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>; thus it is that reason sometimes accepts as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> things that are a hindrance to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And it was through taking this into consideration that <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> added so as to include perfect Happiness--that he "desires nothing amiss": although the first part suffices if rightly understood, to wit, that "<a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> is he who has all he desires."
