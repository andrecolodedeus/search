<h1>Question 5. The effect of contrition</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5005.htm#article1"> Is the remission of sin the effect of contrition?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5005.htm#article2"> Can contrition take away the debt of punishment entirely?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5005.htm#article3"> Does slight contrition suffice to blot out great sins?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the forgiveness of sin is the effect of contrition?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not the effect of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone forgives <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But we are somewhat the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, since it is an act of our own. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of forgiveness.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> follows the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: because <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are not together in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, nothing but <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is an obstacle to receiving the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a> should not go to Communion before going to confession. Therefore they have not yet received the forgiveness of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/psa050.htm#verse19">Psalm 50:19</a>, "A sacrifice to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is an afflicted spirit," says: "A hearty <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is the sacrifice by which <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are loosed."

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> are engendered and corrupted by the same <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, as stated in Ethic. ii, 1,2. Now <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is committed through the heart's inordinate love. Therefore it is destroyed by sorrow <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the heart's ordinate love; and consequently <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> blots out <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Contrition can be considered in two ways, either as part of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, or as an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and in either case it is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but not in the same way. Because, as part of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, it operates primarily as an instrument for the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as is evident with regard to the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> (cf. Sent. iv, D, 1, 1, 4: III, 62, 1); while, as an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, it is the quasi-material <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin's</a> forgiveness. For a disposition is, as it were, a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> for <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>, and a disposition is reduced to a material <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, if it be taken to denote that which disposes <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to receive something. It is otherwise in the case of an agent's disposition to act, because this is reduced to the genus of efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is the principal efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: but the dispositive <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> can be from us also, and likewise the sacramental <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, since the sacramental forms are words uttered by us, having an instrumental power of conferring <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> whereby <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> precedes <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and the infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, in one way, and, in another, follows: and in so far as it follows, the act elicited by the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> can be a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The dispensation of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> belongs to the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: wherefore a man should not go to Communion until his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has been forgiven through the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, although his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may be forgiven him before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether contrition can take away the debt of punishment entirely?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> cannot take away the debt of punishment entirely. For satisfaction and confession are ordained for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> deliverance from the debt of punishment. Now no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is so perfectly <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a> as not to be bound to confession and satisfaction. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is never so great as to blot out the entire debt of punishment.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in Penance the punishment should in some way compensate for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are accomplished by members of the body. Therefore, since it is for the due compensation for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that "by what things a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinneth</a>, by the same also he is tormented" (<a href="../bible/wis011.htm#verse17">Wisdom 11:17</a>), it seems that the punishment for suchlike <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> can never be remitted by <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the sorrow of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is finite. Now an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> punishment is due for some, viz. mortal, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> can never be so great as to remit the whole punishment.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The affections of the heart are more acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than external acts. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> from both punishment and guilt by means of external actions; and therefore he is also by means of the heart's affections, such as <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is.

<p>Further, we have an example of this in the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a>, to whom it was said (<a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse43">Luke 23:43</a>): "This day shalt thou be with Me in paradise," on account of his one act of repentance.

<p>As to whether the whole debt of punishment is always taken away by <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, this question has already been considered above (Sent. iv, D, 14, 2, 1,2; III, 86, 4), where the same question was raised with regard to Penance.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The intensity of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> may be regarded in two ways. First, on the part of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the displeasure, and in this way it may happen that the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is so intense that the <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> resulting therefrom <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> not only the removal of guilt, but also the remission of all punishment. Secondly, on the part of the sensible sorrow, which the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> excites in <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>: and since this sorrow is also a kind of punishment, it may be so intense as to suffice for the remission of both guilt and punishment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot be sure that his <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> suffices for the remission of both punishment and guilt: wherefore he is bound to confess and to make satisfaction, especially since his <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> would not be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, unless he had the purpose of confessing united thereto: which purpose must also be carried into effect, on account of the precept given concerning confession.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as inward <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> redounds into the outward parts of the body, so does interior sorrow show itself in the exterior members: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/pro017.htm#verse22">Proverbs 17:22</a>): "A sorrowful spirit drieth up the bones."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although the sorrow of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is finite in its intensity, even as the punishment due for mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is finite; yet it derives <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, whereby it is quickened, and so it avails for the remission of both guilt and punishment.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether slight contrition suffices to blot out great sins?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that slight <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> does not suffice to blot out great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is the remedy for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now a bodily remedy, that heals a lesser bodily infirmity, does not suffice to heal a greater. Therefore the least <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> does not suffice to blot out very great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it was stated above (Question 3, Article 3) that for greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> one ought to have greater <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> does not blot out <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, unless it fulfills the requisite <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>. Therefore the least <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> does not blot out all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Every <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> blots out every mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because it is incompatible therewith. Now every <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> is quickened by <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>. Therefore, however slight it be, it blots out all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As we have often said (1, 2, ad 1; 3, 1; 4, 1), <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> includes a twofold sorrow. One is in the reason, and is displeasure at the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed. This can be so slight as not to suffice for real <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, e.g. if a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> were less displeasing to a man, than separation from his last end ought to be; just as love can be so slack as not to suffice for real <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. The other sorrow is in the senses, and the slightness of this is no hindrance to real <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, because it does not, of itself, belong <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> to <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, but is connected with it <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>: nor again is it under our control. Accordingly we must say that sorrow, however slight it be, provided it suffice for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, blots out all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Spiritual remedies derive <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> efficacy from the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power which operates in them: wherefore the remedy which suffices for healing a slight <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, suffices also to heal a great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. This is seen in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> which looses great and small: and the same applies to <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> provided it fulfill the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It follows of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> that a man grieves more for a greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than for a lesser, according as it is more repugnant to the love which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> his sorrow. But if one has the same degree of sorrow for a greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as another has for a lesser, this would suffice for the remission of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.
