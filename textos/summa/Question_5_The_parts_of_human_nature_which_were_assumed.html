<h1>Question 5. The parts of human nature which were assumed</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/4005.htm#article1"> Should the Son of God have assumed a true body?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4005.htm#article2"> Should he have assumed an earthly body, i.e. one of flesh and blood?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4005.htm#article3"> Should he have assumed a soul?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4005.htm#article4"> Should he have assumed an intellect?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the Son of God ought to have assumed a true body?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> did not assume a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body. For it is written (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse7">Philippians 2:7</a>), that He was "made in the likeness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>." But what is something in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not said to be in the likeness thereof. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> did not assume a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the assumption of a body in no way diminishes the dignity of the Godhead; for Pope Leo says (Serm. de Nativ.) that "the glorification did not absorb the lesser <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, nor did the assumption lessen the higher." But it pertains to the dignity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be altogether separated from bodies. Therefore it seems that by the assumption <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was not united to a body.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, signs ought to correspond to the realities. But the apparitions of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> which were signs of the manifestation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> were not in a real body, but by <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">visions</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, as is plain from <a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse1">Isaiah 6:1</a>: "I saw the Lord sitting," etc. Hence it would seem that the apparition of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> in the world was not in a real body, but only in <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Qq. lxxxiii, qu. 13): "If the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was a phantom, Christ deceived us, and if He deceived us, He is not the Truth. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the Truth. Therefore His body was not a phantom." Hence it is plain that He assumed a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As is said (De Eccles. Dogm. ii). The <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was not born in appearance only, as if He had an <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> body; but His body was real. The <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this is threefold. First, from the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to which it pertains to have a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body. Therefore granted, as already <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> (4, 1), that it was fitting for the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> to assume <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, He must consequently have assumed a real body. The second reason is taken from what was done in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>. For if His body was not real but <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a>, He neither underwent a real death, nor of those things which the Evangelists recount of Him, did He do any in very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but only in appearance; and hence it would also follow that the real <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has not taken place; since the effect must be proportionate to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. The third reason is taken from the dignity of the Person assuming, Whom it did not become to have anything fictitious in His work, since He is the Truth. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> Himself deigned to refute this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> (<a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse37">Luke 24:37-39</a>), when the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, "troubled and frighted, supposed that they saw a spirit," and not a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body; wherefore He offered Himself to their touch, saying: "Handle, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as you see Me to have."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This likeness indicates the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>--just as all that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> are said to be like in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>--and not a mere <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> likeness. In <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> subjoins (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse8">Philippians 2:8</a>) that He became "obedient unto death, even to the death of the cross"; which would have been impossible, had it been only an <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> likeness.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> By assuming a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is nowise lessened. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [Fulgentius] says (De Fide ad Petrum ii): "He emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, that He might become a servant; yet did He not lose the fulness of the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." For the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> assumed a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body, not so as to become the form of a body, which is repugnant to the Divine simplicity and purity--for this would be to assume a body to the unity of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which is impossible, as is plain from what has been stated above (Question 2, Article 1): but, the natures remaining distinct, He assumed a body to the unity of Person.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The figure ought to correspond to the reality as regards the likeness and not as regards the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the thing. For if they were alike in all points, it would no longer be a likeness but the reality itself, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 26). Hence it was more fitting that the apparitions of the old Testament should be in appearance only, being figures; and that the apparition of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> in the world should be in a real body, being the thing prefigured by these figures. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse17">Colossians 2:17</a>): "Which are a shadow of things to come, but the body is Christ's."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the Son of God ought to have assumed a carnal or earthly body?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had not a carnal or earthly, but a heavenly body. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse41">1 Corinthians 15:41</a>): "The first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was of the earth, earthy; the second <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, heavenly." But the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, i.e. <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, was of the earth as regards his body, as is plain from <a href="../bible/gen001.htm">Genesis 1</a>. Therefore the second <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, i.e. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, was of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> as regards the body.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is said (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse50">1 Corinthians 15:50</a>): "Flesh and blood shall not [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'cannot'] possess the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> chiefly. Therefore there is no flesh or blood in Him, but rather a heavenly body.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whatever is best is to be attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But of all bodies a heavenly body is the best. Therefore it behooved <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to assume such a body.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> says (<a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse39">Luke 24:39</a>): "A spirit hath not flesh and bones, as you see Me to have." Now flesh and bones are not of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of heavenly bodies, but are composed of the inferior elements. Therefore the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not a heavenly, but a carnal and earthly body.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> By the reasons which <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not an <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> one, it may also be shown that it was not a heavenly body. First, because even as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> would not have been maintained had His body been an <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> one, such as Manes supposed, so likewise it would not have been maintained if we supposed, as did Valentine, that it was a heavenly body. For since the form of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> thing, it requires determinate <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, to wit, flesh and bones, which must be placed in the definition of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as is plain from the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. vii, 39). Secondly, because this would lessen the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of such things as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did in the body. For since a heavenly body is impassible and incorruptible, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> De Coel. i, 20, if the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> had assumed a heavenly body, He would not have <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> hungered or thirsted, nor would he have undergone His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">passion</a> and death. Thirdly, this would have detracted from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> truthfulness. For since the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> showed Himself to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as if He had a carnal and earthly body, the manifestation would have been <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, had He had a heavenly body. Hence (De Eccles. Dogm. ii) it is said: "The <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was born, taking flesh of the Virgin's body, and not bringing it with Him from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is said in two ways to have come down from heaven. First, as regards His Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>; not indeed that the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> ceased to be in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, but inasmuch as He began to be here below in a new way, viz. by His assumed. <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse13">John 3:13</a>: "No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hath <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended into heaven</a>, but He that descended from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, Who is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>."

<p>Secondly, as regards His body, not indeed that the very <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> descended from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, but that His body was formed by a heavenly power, i.e. by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, explaining the passage quoted, says (Ad Orosium [Dial. Qq. lxv, qu. 4, work of an unknown author): "I call <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> a heavenly <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> because He was not conceived of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> seed." And <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> expounds it in the same way (De Trin. x).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Flesh and blood are not taken here for the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of flesh and blood, but for the corruption of flesh, which was not in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as far as it was <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>; but as far as it was a punishment; thus, for a time, it was in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that He might carry through the work of our redemption.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It pertains to the greatest <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to have raised a weak and earthly body to such sublimity. Hence in the General Council of Ephesus (P. II, Act. I) we read the saying of St. Theophilus: "Just as the best workmen are esteemed not merely for displaying their skill in precious materials, but very often because by making use of the poorest . . . lay and commonest earth, they show the power of their craft; so the best of all workmen, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, did not come down to us by taking a heavenly body of some most precious <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but shewed the greatness of His skill in clay."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the Son of God assumed a soul?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> did not assume a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For John has said, teaching the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John 1:14</a>): "The Word was made flesh"--no mention being made of a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Now it is not said that "the Word was made flesh" as if changed to flesh, but because He assumed flesh. Therefore He seems not to have assumed a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to the body, in order to quicken it. But this was not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as it would seem, for of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> it is written (<a href="../bible/psa035.htm#verse10">Psalm 35:10</a>): Lord, "with Thee is the fountain of life." Therefore it would seem altogether superfluous for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be there, when the Word was present. But "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> do nothing uselessly," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Coel. i, 32; ii, 56). Therefore the Word would seem not to have assumed a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, by the union of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body is constituted the common <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But "in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> we are not to look for a common <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>," as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 3). Therefore He did not assume a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Agone Christ. xxi): "Let us not hearken to such as say that only a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body was assumed by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>; and take 'the Word was made flesh' to mean that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had no <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> nor any other part of a man, save flesh."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Haeres. 69,55), it was first of all the opinion of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and then of Apollinaris that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> assumed only flesh, without a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, holding that the Word took the place of a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the body. And consequently it followed that there were not two natures in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but only one; for from a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is constituted. But this opinion cannot hold, for three reasons. First, because it is counter to the authority of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>, in which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> makes mention of His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, <a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse38">Matthew 26:38</a>: "My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is sorrowful even unto death"; and <a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse18">John 10:18</a>: "I have power to lay down My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> [animam meam: <a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'My life']." But to this Apollinaris replied that in these words <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is taken metaphorically, in which way mention is made in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse14">Isaiah 1:14</a>): "My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> hateth your new moons and your solemnities." But, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Qq. lxxxiii, qu. 80), the Evangelists relate how <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> wondered, was angered, sad, and hungry. Now these show that He had a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, just as that He ate, slept and was weary shows that He had a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body: otherwise, if these things are a metaphor, because the like are said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, the trustworthiness of the Gospel story is undermined. For it is one thing that things were foretold in a figure, and another that historical events were related in very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by the Evangelists. Secondly, this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> lessens the utility of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> liberation. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [Vigilius Tapsensis] argues thus (Contra Felician. xiii): "If the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> in taking flesh passed over the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, either He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> its sinlessness, and trusted it did not need a remedy; or He considered it unsuitable to Him, and did not bestow on it the boon of redemption; or He reckoned it altogether incurable, and was unable to heal it; or He cast it off as worthless and seemingly unfit for any use. Now two of these reasons imply a <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For how shall we call Him <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>, if He is unable to heal what is beyond hope? Or <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all, if He has not made our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And as regards the other two reasons, in one the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is ignored, and in the other no place is given to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. Is He to be considered to understand the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, Who seeks to separate it from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of wilful transgression, enabled as it is to receive the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> by the endowment of the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of reason? Or how can His generosity be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to any one who says it was despised on account of its ignoble sinfulness? If you look at its origin, the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is more precious than the body: but if at the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of transgression, on account of its <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> it is worse than the body. Now I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and declare that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is perfect wisdom, nor have I any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that He is most <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a>; and because of the first of these He did not despise what was better and more capable of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>; and because of the second He protected what was most wounded." Thirdly, this position is against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>. For flesh and the other parts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> receive their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> through the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Hence, if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is absent, there are no bones nor flesh, except equivocally, as is plain from the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Anima ii, 9; Metaph. vii, 34).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> When we say, "The Word was made flesh," "flesh" is taken for the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as if we were to say, "The Word was made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," as <a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse5">Isaiah 40:5</a>: "All flesh together shall see that the mouth of the Lord hath spoken." And the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is signified by flesh, because, as is said in the authority quoted, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> became visible by flesh; hence it is subjoined: "And we saw His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>." Or because, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Qq. lxxxiii, qu. 80), "in all that union the Word is the highest, and flesh the last and lowest. Hence, wishing to commend the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> to us, the Evangelist mentioned the Word and flesh, leaving the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> on one side, since it is less than the Word and nobler than flesh." Again, it was reasonable to mention flesh, which, as being farther away from the Word, was less assumable, as it would seem.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The Word is the fountain of life, as the first effective <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of life; but the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the principle of the life of the body, as its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Now the form is the effect of the agent. Hence from the presence of the Word it might rather have been concluded that the body was animated, just as from the presence of fire it may be concluded that the body, in which fire adheres, is warm.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is not unfitting, indeed it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to say that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which was constituted by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> coming to the body. But <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> denied that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> there was a common <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, i.e. a third something resulting from the Godhead and the humanity.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the Son of God assumed a human mind or intellect?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> did not assume a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind or <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. For where a thing is present, its image is not required. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> image, as regards his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiv, 3,6). Hence, since in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was the presence of the Divine Word itself, there was no need of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the greater light dims the lesser. But the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, Who is "the light, which enlighteneth every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that cometh into this world," as is written <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse9">John 1:9</a>, is compared to the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> as the greater light to the lesser; since our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is a light, being as it were a lamp enkindled by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">First Light</a> (<a href="../bible/pro020.htm#verse27">Proverbs 20:27</a>): "The spirit of a man is the lamp of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>." Therefore in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Who is the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, there is no need of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the assumption of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is called His <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> or <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind is nothing carnal, either in its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> or in its act. for it is not the act of a body, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> De Anima iii, 6. Hence it would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> did not assume a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [Fulgentius] says (De Fide ad Petrum xiv): "Firmly hold and nowise <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> has <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> flesh and a rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the same kind as ours, since of His flesh He says (<a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse39">Luke 24:39</a>): 'Handle, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as you see Me to have.' And He proves that He has a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, saying (<a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse17">John 10:17</a>): 'I lay down My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'life'] that I may take it again.' And He proves that He has an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, saying (<a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse29">Matthew 11:29</a>): 'Learn of Me, because I am meek and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> of heart.' And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> says of Him by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> (<a href="../bible/isa052.htm#verse13">Isaiah 52:13</a>): 'Behold my servant shall understand.'"

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Haeres. 49,50), "the Apollinarists thought differently from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Church concerning the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, saying with the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> took flesh alone, without a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and on being overcome on this point by the Gospel witness, they went on to say that the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> was wanting to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but that the Word supplied its place." But this position is refuted by the same arguments as the preceding. First, because it runs counter to the Gospel story, which relates how He marveled (as is plain from <a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse10">Matthew 8:10</a>). Now marveling cannot be without reason, since it implies the collation of effect and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, i.e. inasmuch as when we see an effect and are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, we seek to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it, as is said Metaph. i, 2. Secondly, it is inconsistent with the purpose of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, which is the justification of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not capable of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> nor of justifying <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> except through the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. Hence it was especially <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to be assumed. Hence <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 6) that "the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> assumed a body and an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>," and adds afterwards: "The whole was united to the whole, that He might bestow <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> on me wholly; for what was not assumed is not curable." Thirdly, it is against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>. For since the body is proportioned to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to its proper form, it is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh if it is not perfected by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, i.e. a rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And hence if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had had a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> without a mind, He would not have had <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh, but irrational flesh, since our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> differs from an animal <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> alone. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Qq. lxxxiii, qu. 80) that from this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> it would have followed that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> "took an animal with the form of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body," which, again, is against the Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which cannot suffer any fictitious untruth.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Where a thing is by its presence, its image is not required to supply the place of the thing, as where the emperor is the soldiers do not pay homage to his image. Yet the image of a thing is required together with its presence, that it may be perfected by the presence of the thing, just as the image in the wax is perfected by the impression of the seal, and as the image of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is reflected in the mirror by his presence. Hence in order to perfect the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the Word should unite it to Himself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The greater light dims the lesser light of another luminous body; but it does not dim, rather it perfects the light of the body illuminated--at the presence of the sun the light of the stars is put out, but the light of the air is perfected. Now the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> or mind of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is, as it were, a light lit up by the light of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Divine Word</a>; and hence by the presence of the Word the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is perfected rather than overshadowed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> power is not the act of a body, nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is the form of the body, requires that it should be more noble, in order that it may have the power of understanding; and hence it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that a better disposed body should correspond to it.
