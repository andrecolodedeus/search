<h1>Question 5. Those who have faith</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3005.htm#article1"> Was there faith in the angels, or in man, in their original state?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3005.htm#article2"> Do the demons have faith?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3005.htm#article3"> Do those heretics who err in one article, have faith in others?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3005.htm#article4"> Among those who have faith, does one have it more than another?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether there was faith in the angels, or in man, in their original state?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there was no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, either in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, or in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in their original state. For Hugh St. Victor says in his Sentences (De Sacram. i, 10) that "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or things that are in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because he closes his eyes to <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>." Now the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, in their original state, before they were either confirmed in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, or had fallen from it, had their eyes opened to <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, since "they saw things in the Word," according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. ii, 8). Likewise the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, while in the state of innocence, seemingly had his eyes open to <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>; for Hugh St. Victor says (De Sacram. i, 6) that "in his original state <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> his Creator, not by the mere outward perception of hearing, but by inward inspiration, not as now believers seek an absent <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but by seeing Him clearly present to their <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>." Therefore there was no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in their original state.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is dark and obscure, according to <a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse13">1 Corinthians 13:13</a>: "We see now through a glass in a dark manner." Now in their original state there was not obscurity either in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> or in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, because it is a punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore there could be no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> or in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in their original state.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse17">Romans 10:17</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> . . . cometh by hearing." Now this could not apply to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in their original state; for then they could not hear anything from another. Therefore, in that state, there was no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> either in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> or in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse6">Hebrews 11:6</a>): "He that cometh to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>." Now the original state of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was one of approach to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore they had need of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some say that there was no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> before they were confirmed in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> or fell from it, and in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> before he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, by reason of the manifest <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> that they had of Divine things. Since, however, "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the evidence of things that appear not," according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse2">Hebrews 11:2</a>), and since "by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what we see not," according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Tract. xl in Joan.; QQ. Evang. ii, qu. 39), that manifestation alone excludes <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which renders apparent or seen the principal object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Now the principal object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the First Truth, the sight of which gives the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and takes the place of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Consequently, as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> before their confirmation in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, did not possess the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> whereby <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is seen in His Essence, it is evident that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> they possessed was not such as to exclude <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p>It follows then, that the absence of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in them could only be explained by their being altogether <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. And if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in a purely <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> state, as some [St. Bonaventure, Sent. ii, D, 29 hold, perhaps one might hold that there was no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> before their confirmation in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, or in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> surpasses not only a man's but even an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>Since, however, we stated in I, 62, 3; I, 95, 1 that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> with the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, we must needs say that there was in them a certain beginning of hoped-for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, by reason of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> received but not yet consummated, which <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> was begun in their will by hope and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as stated above (Question 4, Article 7). Consequently we must hold that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> had <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> before they were confirmed, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, before he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>. Nevertheless we must observe that in the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, there is something formal, as it were, namely the First Truth surpassing all the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of a creature, and something material, namely, the thing to which we assent while adhering to the First Truth. With regard to the former, before obtaining the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> to come, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is common to all who have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by adhering to the First Truth: whereas with regard to the things which are proposed as the material object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, some are <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> by one, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> manifestly by another, even in the present state, as we have shown above (1, 5; 2, 4, ad 2). In this respect, too, it may be said that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> before being confirmed, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, possessed manifest <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> about certain points in the Divine mysteries, which now we cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> except by <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although the words of <a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugh of St. Victor</a> are those of a master, and have the force of an authority, yet it may be said that the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> which removes the need of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is heavenly <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, whereby the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is seen in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> did not possess this <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> before they were confirmed, nor did <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> before he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>: yet their <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> was of a higher order than ours, for by its means they approached nearer to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and had manifest <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of more of the Divine effects and mysteries than we can have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of. Hence <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was not in them so that they sought an absent <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as we seek Him: since by the light of wisdom He was more present to them than He is to us, although He was not so present to them as He is to the Blessed by the light of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> There was no darkness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> or punishment in the original state of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but there was a certain <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> obscurity in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, in so far as every creature is darkness in comparison with the immensity of the Divine light: and this obscurity suffices for <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In the original state there was no hearing anything from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> speaking outwardly, but there was from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> inspiring inwardly: thus the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> heard, as expressed by the <a href="../bible/psa084.htm#verse9">Psalm 84:9</a>: "I will hear what the Lord <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will speak in me."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether in the demons there is faith?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> have no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Praedest. Sanct. v) that "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> depends on the believer's will": and this is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will, since by it <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> wishes to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Since then no deliberate will of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as stated above (I, 64, 2, ad 5), it seems that in the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> there is no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a>, according to <a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse8">Ephesians 2:8</a>: "By <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> you are saved through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> . . . for it is the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Now, according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/hos003.htm#verse1">Hosea 3:1</a>, "They look to strange gods, and love the husks of the grapes," the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> lost their <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> did not remain in the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> after they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, unbelief would seem to be graver than other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> observes (Tract. lxxxix in Joan.) on <a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse22">John 15:22</a>, "If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: but now they have no excuse for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." Now the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of unbelief is in some men. Consequently, if the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, some men would be guilty of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> graver than that of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, which seems unreasonable. Therefore in the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> there is no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse19">James 2:19</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">devils</a> . . . <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and tremble."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1, 4; 2, 1), the believer's <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> assents to that which he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a>, not because he sees it either in itself, or by resolving it to first self-evident principles, but because his will commands his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to assent. Now, that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> moves the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to assent, may be due to two <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. First, through the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> being directed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and in this way, to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> is a praiseworthy action. Secondly, because the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is convinced that it ought to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what is said, though that conviction is not based on objective evidence. Thus if a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, while preaching the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, were to foretell something, and were to give a sign, by raising a dead <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to life, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of a witness would be convinced so as to recognize clearly that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who lieth not, was speaking, although the thing itself foretold would not be evident in itself, and consequently the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> would not be removed.

<p>Accordingly we must say that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is commended in the first sense in the faithful of Christ: and in this way <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not in the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, but only in the second way, for they see many evident signs, whereby they recognize that the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, although they do not see the things themselves that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> teaches, for instance that there are three Persons in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and so forth.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are, in a way, compelled to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, by the evidence of signs, and so their will deserves no praise for their <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, which is a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, inclines <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, by giving him a certain affection for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, even when that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is lifeless. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> have, is not a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Rather are they compelled to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> through their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> acumen.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The very fact that the signs of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are so evident, that the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are compelled to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, is displeasing to them, so that their <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> is by no means diminished by their <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether a man who disbelieves one article of faith, can have lifeless faith in the other articles?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> who disbelieves one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">article of faith</a>, can have lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the other articles. For the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> is not more able than that of a catholic. Now a catholic's <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> needs the aid of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in order to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> any article whatever of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> any <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a> without the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> contains many articles, so does one science, viz. geometry, contain many conclusions. Now a man may possess the science of geometry as to some geometrical conclusions, and yet be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of other conclusions. Therefore a man can <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> some <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a> without <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> the others.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> obeys <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> the <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a>, so does he also in keeping the commandments of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. Now a man can obey some commandments, and disobey others. Therefore he can <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> some articles, and disbelieve others.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Just as mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, so is disbelief in one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">article of faith</a> contrary to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> does not remain in a man after one mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore neither does <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, after a man disbelieves one article.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Neither living nor lifeless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> remains in a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> who disbelieves one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">article of faith</a>.

<p>The reason of this is that the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of every <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> depends on the formal aspect of the object, without which the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> cannot remain. Now the formal object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the First Truth, as manifested in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> and the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which proceeds from the First Truth. Consequently whoever does not adhere, as to an <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> and Divine rule, to the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which proceeds from the First Truth manifested in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>, has not the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but holds that which is of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> otherwise than by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Even so, it is evident that a man whose mind holds a conclusion without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> how it is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, has not scientific <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but merely an opinion about it. Now it is manifest that he who adheres to the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as to an <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> rule, assents to whatever the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> teaches; otherwise, if, of the things taught by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he holds what he chooses to hold, and rejects what he chooses to reject, he no longer adheres to the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as to an <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> rule, but to his own will. Hence it is evident that a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> who obstinately disbelieves one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">article of faith</a>, is not prepared to follow the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in all things; but if he is not obstinate, he is no longer in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> but only in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. Therefore it is clear that such a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> with regard to one article has no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the other articles, but only a kind of opinion in accordance with his own will.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> does not hold the other <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a>, about which he does not <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, in the same way as one of the faithful does, namely by adhering simply to the Divine Truth, because in order to do so, a man needs the help of the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; but he holds the things that are of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, by his own will and judgment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The various conclusions of a science have their respective means of demonstration, one of which may be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> without another, so that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> some conclusions of a science without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the others. On the other hand <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> adheres to all the <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a> by reason of one mean, viz. on account of the First Truth proposed to us in <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, according to the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> who has the right understanding of them. Hence whoever abandons this mean is altogether lacking in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The various precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> may be referred either to their respective proximate motives, and thus one can be kept without another; or to their primary motive, which is perfect obedience to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in which a man fails whenever he breaks one commandment, according to <a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse10">James 2:10</a>: "Whosoever shall . . . offend in one point is become guilty of all."

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether faith can be greater in one man than in another?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> cannot be greater in one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> than in another. For the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is taken from its object. Now whoever has <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> everything that is of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, since by failing in one point, a man loses his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> altogether, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> cannot be greater in one than in another.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, those things which consist in something supreme cannot be "more" or "less." Now <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> consists in something supreme, because it requires that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should adhere to the First Truth above all things. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> cannot be "more" or "less."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as the understanding of principles is to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a> are the first principles of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as was shown above (Question 1, Article 7). Now the understanding of principles is possessed in equal degree by all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is possessed in equal degree by all the faithful.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Wherever we find great and little, there we find more or less. Now in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> we find great and little, for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> (<a href="../bible/mat014.htm#verse31">Matthew 14:31</a>): "O thou of little <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, why didst thou <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>?" And to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> he said (<a href="../bible/mat015.htm">Matthew 15:28</a>): "O <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, great is thy <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>!" Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> can be greater in one than in another.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (I-II, 52, 1,2; I-II, 112, 4), the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> may be considered from two points of view: first, on the part of the object; secondly, on the part of its participation by the subject.

<p>Now the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> may be considered in two ways: first, in respect of its formal aspect; secondly, in respect of the material object which is proposed to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. Now the formal object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is one and simple, namely the First Truth, as stated above (Question 1, Article 1). Hence in this respect there is no diversity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> among believers, but it is specifically one in all, as stated above (Question 4, Article 6). But the things which are proposed as the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of our <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> are many and can be received more or less explicitly; and in this respect one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> explicitly more things than another, so that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> can be greater in one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> on account of its being more explicit.

<p>If, on the other hand, we consider <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> from the point of view of its participation by the subject, this happens in two ways, since the act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> proceeds both from the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as stated above (2, 1,2; 4, 2). Consequently a man's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> may be described as being greater, in one way, on the part of his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, on account of its greater <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> and firmness, and, in another way, on the part of his will, on account of his greater promptitude, devotion, or confidence.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who obstinately disbelieves a thing that is of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, has not the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and yet he who does not explicitly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> all, while he is prepared to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> all, has that <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. On this respect, one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has greater <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> than another, on the part of the object, in so far as he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> more things, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that one should give the first place to the First Truth. But among those who do this, some submit to it with greater <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> and devotion than others; and in this way <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is greater in one than in another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The understanding of principles results from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which is equally shared by all: whereas <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> results from the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which is not equally in all, as explained above (I-II, 112, 4). Hence the comparison fails.

<p>Nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of principles is more <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to one than to another, according to the greater capacity of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.
