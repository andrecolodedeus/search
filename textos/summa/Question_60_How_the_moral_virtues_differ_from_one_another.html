<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether there is only one moral virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is only one moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Because just as the direction of moral actions belongs to reason which is the subject of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; so does their inclination belong to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> which is the subject of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. But there is only one <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to direct all moral acts, viz. <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Therefore there is also but one moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to give all moral acts their respective inclinations.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> differ, not in respect of their material objects, but according to the formal aspect of their objects. Now the formal aspect of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to which moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is directed, is one thing, viz. the mean defined by reason. Therefore, seemingly, there is but one moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, things pertaining to morals are specified by their end, as stated above (Question 1, Article 3). Now there is but one common end of all moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, viz. <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, while the proper and proximate ends are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in number. But the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> themselves are not <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in number. Therefore it seems that there is but one.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> One <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> cannot be in several powers, as stated above (Question 56, Article 2). But the subject of the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> is the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is divided into several powers, as stated in the I, 80, 2; I, 81, 2. Therefore there cannot be only one moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (58, A1,2,3), the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> faculty. Now <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> differ specifically according to the specific differences of their objects, as stated above (Question 54, Article 2). Again, the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the object of <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, as of any thing, depends on its specific form which it receives from the agent. But we must observe that the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the passive subject bears a twofold relation to the agent. For sometimes it receives the form of the agent, in the same kind specifically as the agent has that form, as happens with all univocal agents, so that if the agent be one specifically, the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> must of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> receive a form specifically one: thus the univocal effect of fire is of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> something in the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of fire. Sometimes, however, the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> receives the form from the agent, but not in the same kind specifically as the agent, as is the case with non-univocal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of generation: thus an animal is generated by the sun. In this case the forms received into <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> are not of one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but vary according to the adaptability of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to receive the influx of the agent: for instance, we see that owing to the one action of the sun, animals of various <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are produced by putrefaction according to the various adaptability of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p>Now it is evident that in moral matters the reason holds the place of commander and mover, while the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power is commanded and moved. But the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> does not receive the direction of reason univocally so to say; because it is rational, not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, but by participation (Ethic. i, 13). Consequently objects made appetible by the direction of reason belong to various <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, according to their various relations to reason: so that it follows that moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are of various <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and are not one only.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The object of the reason is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Now in all moral matters, which are contingent matters of action, there is but one kind of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Consequently, there is but one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to direct all such matters, viz. <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. On the other hand, the object of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power is the appetible <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which varies in kind according to its various relations to reason, the directing power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This formal element is one generically, on account of the unity of the agent: but it varies in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, on account of the various relations of the receiving <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as explained above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Moral matters do not receive their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the last end, but from their proximate ends: and these, although they be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in number, are not <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether moral virtues about operations are different from those that are about passions?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not divided into those which are about operations and those which are about <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 3) that moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is "an operative <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> whereby we do what is best in matters of pleasure or sorrow." Now pleasure and sorrow are <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, as stated above (31, 1; 35, 1). Therefore the same <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which is about <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> is also about operations, since it is an operative <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are principles of external action. If therefore some <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> regulate the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, they must, as a consequence, regulate operations also. Therefore the same moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are about both <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and operations.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is moved well or ill towards every external operation. Now movements of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> are <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Therefore the same <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> that are about operations are also about <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> reckons <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to be about operations; and <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> and gentleness, about <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> (Ethic. ii, 3,7; v, 1, seqq.).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Operation and passion stand in a twofold relation to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. First, as its effects; and in this way every moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> has some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> operations as its product; and a certain pleasure or sorrow which are <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, as stated above (59, 4, ad 1).

<p>Secondly, operation may be compared to moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> as the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> about which <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is concerned: and in this sense those moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which are about operations must needs differ from those which are about <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. The reason for this is that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, in certain operations, are taken from the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of those operations, no matter how <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may be affected towards them: viz. in so far as <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in them depend on their being commensurate with someone else. In operations of this kind there needs to be some power to regulate the operations in themselves: such are buying and selling, and all such operations in which there is an element of something due or undue to another. For this reason <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and its parts are properly about operations as their proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. On the other hand, in some operations, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> depend only on commensuration with the agent. Consequently <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in these operations depend on the way in which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is affected to them. And for this reason in such like operations <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> must needs be chiefly about internal emotions which are called the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as is evidently the case with <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> and the like.

<p>It happens, however, in operations which are directed to another, that the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is overlooked by reason of some inordinate passion of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. In such cases <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is destroyed in so far as the due measure of the external act is destroyed: while some other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is destroyed in so far as the internal <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> exceed their due measure. Thus when through <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> strikes another, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is destroyed in the undue blow; while gentleness is destroyed by the immoderate <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. The same may be clearly applied to other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections. For the first considers operations as the effect of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, while the other two consider operation and passion as concurring in the same effect. But in some cases <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is chiefly about operations, in others, about <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, for the reason given above.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether there is only one moral virtue about operations?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is but one moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> about operations. Because the rectitude of all external operations seems to belong to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is but one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore there is but one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> about operations.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, those operations seem to differ most, which are directed on the one side to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, and on the other to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the many. But this diversity does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> diversity among the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. v, 1) that legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which directs <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, does not differ, save <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a>, from the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which directs a man's actions to one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> only. Therefore diversity of operations does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a diversity of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if there are various moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> about various operations, diversity of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> would needs follow diversity of operations. But this is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>: for it is the function of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to establish rectitude in various kinds of commutations, and again in distributions, as is set down in Ethic. v, 2. Therefore there are not different <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> about different operations.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Religion is a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> distinct from piety, both of which are about operations.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> All the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> that are about operations agree in one general notion of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which is in respect of something due to another: but they differ in respect of various special notions. The reason for this is that in external operations, the order of reason is established, as we have stated (2), not according as how <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is affected towards such operations, but according to the becomingness of the thing itself; from which becomingness we derive the notion of something due which is the formal aspect of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: for, seemingly, it pertains to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> that a man give another his due. Wherefore all such <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> as are about operations, bear, in some way, the character of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. But the thing due is not of the same kind in all these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: for something is due to an equal in one way, to a superior, in another way, to an inferior, in yet another; and the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a debt differs according as it arises from a contract, a promise, or a favor already conferred. And corresponding to these various kinds of debt there are various <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: e.g. "Religion" whereby we pay our debt to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; "Piety," whereby we pay our debt to our parents or to our country; "Gratitude," whereby we pay our debt to our benefactors, and so forth.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Justice properly so called is one special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, whose object is the perfect due, which can be paid in the equivalent. But the name of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is extended also to all cases in which something due is rendered: in this sense it is not as a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> That <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> which seeks the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is another <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> from that which is directed to the private <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>: wherefore common right differs from private right; and Tully (De Inv. ii) reckons as a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, piety which directs <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of his country. But that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> which directs <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is a general <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> through its act of command: since it directs all the acts of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> to its own end, viz. the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, in so far as they are commanded by that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, receive the name of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: so that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> does not differ, save <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a>, from legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; just as there is only a <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> difference between a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that is active of itself, and a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that is active through the command of another <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There is the same kind of due in all the operations belonging to special <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Consequently, there is the same <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, especially in regard to commutations. For it may be that distributive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is of another <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from commutative <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; but about this we shall inquire later on (II-II, 61, 1).

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether there are different moral virtues about different passions?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there are not different moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> about different <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. For there is but one <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> about things that concur in their source and end: as is evident especially in the case of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> all concur in one source, viz. love; and they all terminate in the same end, viz. <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> or sorrow, as we stated above (25, A1,2,4; 27, 4). Therefore there is but one moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> about all the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if there were different moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> about different <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, it would follow that there are as many moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> as <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. But this clearly is not the case: since there is one moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> about contrary <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>; namely, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, about fear and daring; <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, about pleasure and sorrow. Therefore there is no need for different moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> about different <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, love, desire, and pleasure are <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as stated above (Question 23, Article 4). Now there is but one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> about all these three, viz. <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>. Therefore there are not different moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> about different <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Fortitude is about fear and daring; <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> about desire; meekness about <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; as stated in Ethic. iii, 6,10; iv, 5.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It cannot be said that there is only one moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> about all the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>: since some <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are not in the same power as other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>; for some belong to the irascible, others to the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty, as stated above (Question 23, Article 1).

<p>On the other hand, neither does every diversity of <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> suffice for a diversity of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. First, because some <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are in contrary opposition to one another, such as <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and sorrow, fear and daring, and so on. About such <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> as are thus in opposition to one another there must needs be one same <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Because, since moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> consists in a kind of mean, the mean in contrary <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> stands in the same ratio to both, even as in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order there is but one mean between contraries, e.g. between black and white. Secondly, because there are different <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> contradicting reason in the same manner, e.g. by impelling to that which is contrary to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, or by withdrawing from that which is in accord with reason. Wherefore the different <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty do not require different moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, because their movements follow one another in a certain order, as being directed to the one same thing, viz. the attainment of some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or the avoidance of some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: thus from love proceeds desire, and from desire we arrive at pleasure; and it is the same with the opposite <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, for <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> leads to avoidance or dislike, and this leads to sorrow. On the other hand, the irascible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are not all of one order, but are directed to different things: for daring and fear are about some great danger; hope and <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> are about some difficult <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; while <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> seeks to overcome something contrary which has wrought harm. Consequently there are different <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> about such like <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>: e.g. <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, about the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>; <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, about fear and daring; magnanimity, about hope and <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>; meekness, about <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> All the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> concur in one common principle and end; but not in one proper principle or end: and so this does not suffice for the unity of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order the same principle <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> movement from one extreme and movement towards the other; and as in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> order contraries have one common ratio; so too between contrary <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> there is but one moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which, like a second <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, consents to reason's dictates.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Those three <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are directed to the same object in a certain order, as stated above: and so they belong to the same <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the moral virtues differ in point of the various objects of the passions?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> do not differ according to the objects of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. For just as there are objects of <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, so are there objects of operations. Now those moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> that are about operations, do not differ according to the objects of those operations: for the buying and selling either of a house or of a horse belong to the one same <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Therefore neither do those moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> that are about <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> differ according to the objects of those <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are acts or movements of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Now it needs a greater difference to differentiate <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> than acts. Hence diverse objects which do not diversify the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, do not diversify the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: so that there is but one moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> about all objects of pleasure, and the same applies to the other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, more or less do not change a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Now various objects of pleasure differ only by reason of being more or less pleasurable. Therefore all objects of pleasure belong to one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: and for the same reason so do all fearful objects, and the same applies to others. Therefore moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not diversified according to the objects of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> hinders <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, even as it produces <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But there are various <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> about the desires for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things: thus <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is about desires for the pleasure of touch, and "eutrapelia" [<em>eutrapelia</em>] about pleasures in games. Therefore there should be different <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> about <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Chastity is about sexual pleasures, abstinence about pleasures of the table, and "eutrapelia" about pleasures in games.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The perfection of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> depends on the reason; whereas the perfection of a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> depends on the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Consequently <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> must needs be differentiated according to their relation to reason, but the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> according to their relation to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Hence the objects of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, according as they are variously related to the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>: while, according as they are related to reason, they <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Now the movement of reason is not the same as that of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Wherefore nothing hinders a difference of objects from <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> diversity of <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> diversity of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as when one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is about several <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>); and again, a difference of objects from <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> different <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> a difference of <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, since several <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are directed about one passion, e.g. pleasure.

<p>And because diverse <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> belonging to diverse powers, always belong to diverse <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>); therefore a difference of objects that corresponds to a difference of powers always <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a specific difference of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>--for instance the difference between that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> absolutely speaking, and that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and difficult to obtain. Moreover since the reason rules <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> lower powers in a certain order, and even extends to outward things; hence, one single object of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, according as it is apprehended by sense, <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, or reason, and again, according as it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, body, or external things, has various relations to reason, and consequently is of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a difference of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Consequently <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is the object of love, desire and pleasure, may be taken as referred either to a bodily sense, or to the inner apprehension of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>: and this same <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> may be directed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in himself, either in his body or in his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, or to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in relation to other men. And every such difference, being differently related to reason, differentiates <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p>Accordingly, if we take a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and it be something discerned by the sense of touch, and something pertaining to the upkeep of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life either in the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> or in the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, such as the pleasures of the table or of sexual intercourse, it will belong to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of "<a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>." As regards the pleasures of the other senses, they are not intense, and so do not present much difficulty to the reason: hence there is no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> corresponding to them; for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, "like art, is about difficult things" (Ethic. ii, 3).

<p>On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> discerned not by the senses, but by an inner power, and belonging to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in himself, is like money and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>; the former, by its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, being employable for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the body, while the latter is based on the apprehension of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. These goods again may be considered either absolutely, in which way they concern the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty, or as being difficult to obtain, in which way they belong to the irascible part: which distinction, however, has no place in pleasurable objects of touch; since such are of base <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, and are becoming to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in so far as he has something in common with irrational animals. Accordingly in reference to money considered as a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> absolutely, as an object of desire, pleasure, or love, there is "liberality": but if we consider this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as difficult to get, and as being the object of our hope, there is "magnificence" [<em>megaloprepeia</em>]. With regard to that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which we call <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, taken absolutely, as the object of love, we have a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> called "philotimia" [<em>philotimia</em>], i.e. "love of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>": while if we consider it as hard to attain, and as an object of hope, then we have "magnanimity." Wherefore liberality and "philotimia" seem to be in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> part, while magnificence and magnanimity are in the irascible.

<p>As regards <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in relation to other men, it does not seem hard to obtain, but is considered absolutely, as the object of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. This <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> may be pleasurable to a man in his behavior towards another either in some serious <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, in actions, to wit, that are directed by reason to a due end, or in playful actions, viz. that are done for mere pleasure, and which do not stand in the same relation to reason as the former. Now one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> behaves towards another in serious matters, in two ways. First, as being pleasant in his regard, by becoming speech and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>: and this belongs to a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> (Ethic. ii, 7) calls "friendship" [<em>philia</em>], and may be rendered "affability." Secondly, one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> behaves towards another by being frank with him, in words and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>: this belongs to another <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which (Ethic. iv, 7) he calls "truthfulness" [<em>aletheia</em>]. For frankness is more akin to the reason than pleasure, and serious matters than play. Hence there is another <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> about the pleasures of games, which the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> "eutrapelia" [<em>eutrapelia</em>] (Ethic. iv, 8).

<p>It is therefore evident that, according to <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, there are ten moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> about the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, viz. <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, liberality, magnificence, magnanimity, "philotimia," gentleness, friendship, truthfulness, and "eutrapelia," all of which differ in respect of their diverse <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, or objects: so that if we add "<a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>," which is about operations, there will be eleven in all.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> All objects of the same specific operation have the same relation to reason: not so all the objects of the same specific passion; because operations do not thwart reason as the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> do.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Passions are not differentiated by the same rule as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> More and less do not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a difference of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, unless they bear different relations to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Good is a more potent mover than <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: because <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> movement save in virtue of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> states (Div. Nom. iv). Hence an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> an obstacle to reason, so as to require <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> unless that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> be great; there being, seemingly, one such <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> corresponding to each kind of passion. Hence there is but one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, meekness, for every form of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; and, again, but one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, for all forms of daring. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> involves difficulty, which requires <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, even if it be not a great <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in that particular kind of passion. Consequently there are various moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> about desires, as stated above.
