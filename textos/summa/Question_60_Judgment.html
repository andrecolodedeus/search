<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether judgment is an act of justice?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that judgment is not an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. i, 3) that "everyone judges well of what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>," so that judgment would seem to belong to the cognitive faculty. Now the cognitive faculty is perfected by <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Therefore judgment belongs to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> rather than to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which is in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as stated above (Question 58, Article 4).

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse15">1 Corinthians 2:15</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> judgeth all things." Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is made <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> chiefly by the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which "is poured forth in our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> Who is given to us" (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans 5:5</a>). Therefore judgment belongs to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> rather than to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it belongs to every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to judge aright of its proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, because "the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is the rule and measure in everything," according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iii, 4). Therefore judgment does not belong to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> any more than to the other moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, judgment would seem to belong only to judges. But the act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is to be found in every just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Since then judges are not the only just men, it seems that judgment is not the proper act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa093.htm#verse15">Psalm 93:15</a>): "Until <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> be turned into judgment."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Judgment properly denotes the act of a judge as such. Now a judge [judex] is so called because he asserts the right [jus dicens] and right is the object of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as stated above (Question 57, Article 1). Consequently the original meaning of the word "judgment" is a statement or decision of the just or right. Now to decide rightly about <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> proceeds, properly speaking, from the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>; thus a chaste <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> decides rightly about matters relating to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. Therefore judgment, which denotes a right decision about what is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, belongs properly to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. For this reason the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. v, 4) that "men have recourse to a judge as to one who is the personification of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The word "judgment," from its original meaning of a right decision about what is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, has been extended to signify a right decision in any <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> whether speculative or practical. Now a right judgment in any <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> requires two things. The first is the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> itself that pronounces judgment: and in this way, judgment is an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, because it belongs to the reason to pronounce or define. The other is the disposition of the one who judges, on which depends his aptness for judging aright. On this way, in matters of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, judgment proceeds from <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, even as in matters of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, it proceeds from <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. Accordingly judgment is an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> in so far as <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> inclines one to judge aright, and of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> in so far as <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> pronounces judgment: wherefore <em>synesis</em> (judging well according to common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>) which belongs to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is said to "judge rightly," as stated above (Question 51, Article 3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, by reason of the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, has an inclination to judge aright of all things according to the Divine rules; and it is in conformity with these that he pronounces judgment through the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of wisdom: even as the just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> pronounces judgment through the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> conformably with the ruling of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> regulate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in himself, whereas <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> regulates <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in his dealings with others, as shown above (Question 58, Article 2). Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is master in things concerning himself, but not in matters relating to others. Consequently where the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are in question, there is no need for judgment other than that of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, taking judgment in its broader sense, as explained above (ad 1). But in matters of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, there is further need for the judgment of a superior, who is "able to reprove both, and to put his hand between both" [<a href="../bible/job009.htm#verse33">Job 9:33</a>]. Hence judgment belongs more specifically to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> than to any other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Justice is in the sovereign as a master-<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> [Cf. 58, 6], commanding and prescribing what is just; while it is in the subjects as an executive and administrative <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Hence judgment, which denotes a decision of what is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, belongs to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, considered as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> chiefly in one who has authority.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether it is lawful to judge?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem unlawful to judge. For nothing is punished except what is unlawful. Now those who judge are threatened with punishment, which those who judge not will escape, according to <a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse1">Matthew 7:1</a>, "Judge not, and ye shall not be judged." Therefore it is unlawful to judge.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse4">Romans 14:4</a>): "Who art thou that judgest another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> servant. To his own lord he standeth or falleth." Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the Lord of all. Therefore to no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is it lawful to judge.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is sinless, according to <a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#verse8">1 John 1:8</a>, "If we say that we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we deceive ourselves." Now it is unlawful for a sinner to judge, according to <a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse1">Romans 2:1</a>, "Thou art inexcusable, O <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, whosoever thou art, that judgest; for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself, for thou dost the same things which thou judgest." Therefore to no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is it lawful to judge.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/deu016.htm#verse18">Deuteronomy 16:18</a>): "Thou shalt appoint judges and magistrates in all thy gates . . . that they may judge the people with just judgment."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Judgment is lawful in so far as it is an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Now it follows from what has been stated above (1, ad 1,3) that three <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> are requisite for a judgment to be an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: first, that it proceed from the inclination of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; secondly, that it come from one who is in authority; thirdly, that it be pronounced according to the right ruling of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. If any one of these be lacking, the judgment will be faulty and unlawful. First, when it is contrary to the rectitude of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and then it is called "perverted" or "<a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>": secondly, when a man judges about matters wherein he has no authority, and this is called judgment "by usurpation": thirdly, when the reason lacks <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>, as when a man, without any solid motive, forms a judgment on some <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> or hidden <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and then it is called judgment by "suspicion" or "rash" judgment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In these words <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> forbids rash judgment which is about the inward <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, or other uncertain things, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 18). Or else He forbids judgment about Divine things, which we ought not to judge, but simply <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, since they are above us, as <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> declares in his commentary on <a href="../bible/mat005.htm">Matthew 5</a>. Or again according to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> [Hom. xvii in Matth. in the Opus Imperfectum <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08480a.htm">St. John of the Cross</a>], He forbids the judgment which proceeds not from benevolence but from bitterness of heart.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A judge is appointed as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> servant; wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/deu001.htm#verse16">Deuteronomy 1:16</a>): "Judge that which is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>," and further on (<a href="../bible/deu001.htm#verse17">Deuteronomy 1:17</a>), "because it is the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Those who stand guilty of grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> should not judge those who are guilty of the same or lesser <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> [Hom. xxiv] says on the words of <a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse1">Matthew 7:1</a>, "Judge not." Above all does this hold when such <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are public, because there would be an occasion of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> arising in the hearts of others. If however they are not public but hidden, and there be an urgent <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> for the judge to pronounce judgment, because it is his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, he can reprove or judge with <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> and fear. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 19): "If we find that we are guilty of the same <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, we should groan together with him, and invite him to strive against it together with us." And yet it is not through acting thus that a man condemns himself so as to deserve to be condemned once again, but when, in condemning another, he shows himself to be equally deserving of condemnation on account of another or a like <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether it is unlawful to form a judgment from suspicions?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is not unlawful to form a judgment from suspicions. For suspicion is seemingly an uncertain opinion about an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. vi, 3) that suspicion is about both the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Now it is impossible to have any but an uncertain opinion about contingent singulars. Since then <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> judgment is about <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, which are about singular and contingent matters, it seems that no judgment would be lawful, if it were not lawful to judge from suspicions.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a man does his neighbor an injury by judging him unlawfully. But an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> suspicion consists in nothing more than a man's opinion, and consequently does not seem to pertain to the injury of another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore judgment based on suspicion is not unlawful.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if it is unlawful, it must needs be reducible to an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, since judgment is an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Now an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> is always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> according to its genus, as stated above (Question 59, Article 4). Therefore a judgment based on suspicion would always be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, if it were unlawful. But this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, because "we cannot avoid suspicions," according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Tract. xc in Joan.) on <a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse5">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>, "Judge not before the time." Therefore a judgment based on suspicion would seem not to be unlawful.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> [Hom. xvii in Matth. in the Opus Imperfectum <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08480a.htm">St. John of the Cross</a>] in comment on the words of <a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse1">Matthew 7:1</a>, "Judge not," etc., says: "By this commandment our Lord does not forbid <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to reprove others from kindly motives, but that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> should despise <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> by boasting his own righteousness, by hating and condemning others for the most part on mere suspicion."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As Tully says (De Invent. Rhet. ii), suspicion denotes <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thinking based on slight indications, and this is due to three <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. First, from a man being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in himself, and from this very fact, as though conscious of his own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, he is prone to think <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of others, according to <a href="../bible/ecc010.htm#verse3">Ecclesiastes 10:3</a>, "The fool when he walketh in the way, whereas he himself is a fool, esteemeth all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> fools." Secondly, this is due to a man being ill-disposed towards another: for when a man <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> or despises another, or is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with or <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> of him, he is led by slight indications to think <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of him, because everyone easily <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> what he desires. Thirdly, this is due to long experience: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 13) that "old people are very suspicious, for they have often experienced the faults of others." The first two <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of suspicion evidently connote perversity of the affections, while the third diminishes the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of suspicion, in as much as experience leads to <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> which is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of suspicion. Consequently suspicion denotes a certain amount of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, and the further it goes, the more <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> it is.

<p>Now there are three degrees of suspicion. The first degree is when a man begins to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> of another's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> from slight indications. This is a venial and a light <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for "it belongs to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> without which no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can go through this life," according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse5">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>, "Judge not before the time." The second degree is when a man, from slight indications, esteems another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> as certain. This is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, if it be about a grave <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, since it cannot be without contempt of one's neighbor. Hence the same <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> goes on to say: "If then we cannot avoid suspicions, because we are <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, we must nevertheless restrain our judgment, and refrain from forming a definite and fixed opinion." The third degree is when a judge goes so far as to condemn a man on suspicion: this pertains directly to <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, and consequently is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Some kind of <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> is found in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, not indeed the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of a demonstration, but such as is befitting the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in point, for instance when a thing is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by suitable <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> From the very fact that a man thinks <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of another without sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, he despises him unduly, and therefore does him an injury.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> are about external operations, as stated above (58, 8,10,11; 59, 1, ad 3), the judgment of suspicion pertains directly to <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> when it is betrayed by external action, and then it is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated above. The internal judgment pertains to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, in so far as it is related to the external judgment, even as the internal to the external act, for instance as desire is related to fornication, or <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> to <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether doubts should be interpreted for the best?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> should not be interpreted for the best. Because we should judge from what happens for the most part. But it happens for the most part that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is done, since "the number of fools is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>" (<a href="../bible/ecc001.htm#verse15">Ecclesiastes 1:15</a>), "for the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> and thought of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> heart are prone to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> from his youth" (<a href="../bible/gen008.htm#verse21">Genesis 8:21</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> should be interpreted for the worst rather than for the best.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 27) that "he leads a godly and just life who is sound in his estimate of things, and turns neither to this side nor to that." Now he who interprets a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> point for the best, turns to one side. Therefore this should not be done.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should love his neighbor as himself. Now with regard to himself, a man should interpret <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> matters for the worst, according to <a href="../bible/job009.htm#verse28">Job 9:28</a>, "I feared all my works." Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> matters affecting one's neighbor should be interpreted for the worst.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse3">Romans 14:3</a>, "He that eateth not, let him not judge him that eateth," says: "Doubts should be interpreted in the best sense."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (3, ad 2), things from the very fact that a man thinks ill of another without sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, he injures and despises him. Now no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ought to despise or in any way injure another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> without urgent <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: and, consequently, unless we have evident indications of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, we ought to deem him <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, by interpreting for the best whatever is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> about him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> He who interprets <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> matters for the best, may happen to be deceived more often than not; yet it is better to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> frequently through thinking well of a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, than to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> less frequently through having an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> opinion of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, because in the latter case an injury is inflicted, but not in the former.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is one thing to judge of things and another to judge of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. For when we judge of things, there is no question of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of the thing about which we are judging, since it will take no harm no <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> what kind of judgment we form about it; but there is question of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who judges, if he judge <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, and of his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> if he judge <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> because "the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> is its <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>," as stated in Ethic. vi, 2, wherefore everyone should strive to make his judgment accord with things as they are. On the other hand when we judge of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in our judgment is considered chiefly on the part of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> about whom judgment is being formed; for he is deemed worthy of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> from the very fact that he is judged to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and deserving of contempt if he is judged to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For this reason we ought, in this kind of judgment, to aim at judging a man <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, unless there is evident <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the contrary. And though we may judge <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>, our judgment in thinking well of another pertains to our <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> feeling and not to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, even as neither does it pertain to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect's</a> perfection to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of contingent singulars in themselves.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> One may interpret something for the worst or for the best in two ways. First, by a kind of supposition; and thus, when we have to apply a remedy to some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, whether our own or another's, in order for the remedy to be applied with greater <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of a cure, it is expedient to take the worst for granted, since if a remedy be efficacious against a worse <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, much more is it efficacious against a lesser <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Secondly we may interpret something for the best or for the worst, by deciding or determining, and in this case when judging of things we should try to interpret each thing according as it is, and when judging of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, to interpret things for the best as stated above.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether we should always judge according to the written law?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that we ought not always to judge according to the written <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. For we ought always to avoid judging <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>. But written laws sometimes contain <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, according to <a href="../bible/isa010.htm#verse1">Isaiah 10:1</a>, "Woe to them that make <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> laws, and when they write, write <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>." Therefore we ought not always to judge according to the written <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, judgment has to be formed about <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> happenings.

<p>But no written <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> can cover each and every <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> happening, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> declares (Ethic. v, 10). Therefore it seems that we are not always bound to judge according to the written <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is written in order that the lawgiver's <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> may be made clear. But it happens sometimes that even if the lawgiver himself were present he would judge otherwise. Therefore we ought not always to judge according to the written <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Vera Relig. xxxi): "In these earthly laws, though men judge about them when they are making them, when once they are established and passed, the judges may judge no longer of them, but according to them."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), judgment is nothing else but a decision or determination of what is just. Now a thing becomes just in two ways: first by the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the case, and this is called "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> right," secondly by some agreement between men, and this is called "positive right," as stated above (Question 57, Article 2). Now laws are written for the purpose of manifesting both these rights, but in different ways. For the written <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> does indeed contain <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> right, but it does not establish it, for the latter derives its force, not from the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> but from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: whereas the written <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> both contains positive right, and establishes it by giving it force of authority.

<p>Hence it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to judge according to the written <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, else judgment would fall short either of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> or of the positive right.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Just as the written <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> does not give force to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> right, so neither can it diminish or annul its force, because neither can <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will change <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence if the written <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> contains anything contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> right, it is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> and has no binding force. For positive right has no place except where "it matters not," according to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> right, "whether a thing be done in one way or in another"; as stated above (57, 2, ad 2). Wherefore such documents are to be called, not laws, but rather corruptions of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, as stated above (I-II, 95, 2): and consequently judgment should not be delivered according to them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Even as <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> laws by their very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> are, either always or for the most part, contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> right, so too laws that are rightly established, fail in some cases, when if they were observed they would be contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> right. Wherefore in such cases judgment should be delivered, not according to the letter of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, but according to equity which the lawgiver has in view. Hence the jurist says [Digest. i, 3; De leg. senatusque consult. 25]: "By no reason of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, or favor of equity, is it allowable for us to interpret harshly, and render burdensome, those useful measures which have been enacted for the welfare of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." On such cases even the lawgiver himself would decide otherwise; and if he had foreseen the case, he might have provided for it by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the Third Objection.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether judgment is rendered perverse by being usurped?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that judgment is not rendered perverse by being usurped. For <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is rectitude in matters of action. Now <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not impaired, no <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> who tells it, but it may suffer from the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who ought to accept it. Therefore again <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> loses nothing, no <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> who declares what is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, and this is what is meant by judgment.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it belongs to judgment to punish <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Now it is related to the praise of some that they punished <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> without having authority over those whom they punished; such as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in slaying the Egyptian (<a href="../bible/exo002.htm#verse12">Exodus 2:12</a>), and Phinees the son of Eleazar in slaying Zambri the son of Salu (<a href="../bible/num025.htm#verse7">Numbers 25:7-14</a>), and "it was reputed to him unto <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>" (<a href="../bible/psa105.htm#verse31">Psalm 105:31</a>). Therefore usurpation of judgment pertains not to <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power is distinct from temporal. Now <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> having <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power sometimes interfere in matters concerning the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a>. Therefore usurped judgment is not unlawful.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, even as the judge requires authority in order to judge aright, so also does he need <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, as shown above (1, ad 1,3; 2). But a judgment is not described as <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, if he who judges lacks the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> or the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Neither therefore is it always <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> to judge by usurpation, i.e. without authority.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse4">Romans 14:4</a>): "Who art thou that judgest another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> servant?"

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since judgment should be pronounced according to the written <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, as stated above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>), he that pronounces judgment, interprets, in a way, the letter of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, by applying it to some particular case. Now since it belongs to the same authority to interpret and to make a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, just as a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> cannot be made save by public authority, so neither can a judgment be pronounced except by public authority, which extends over those who are subject to the community. Wherefore even as it would be <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> for one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to force another to observe a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> that was not approved by public authority, so too it is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, if a man compels another to submit to a judgment that is pronounced by other than the public authority.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> When the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is declared there is no <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to accept it, and each one is free to receive it or not, as he wishes. On the other hand judgment implies an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, wherefore it is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> for anyone to be judged by one who has no public authority.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> seems to have slain the Egyptian by authority received as it were, by divine inspiration; this seems to follow from <a href="../bible/act007.htm#verse24">Acts 7:24-25</a>, where it is said that "striking the Egyptian . . . he thought that his brethren understood that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by his hand would save <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'them']." Or it may be replied that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> slew the Egyptian in order to defend the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who was <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> attacked, without himself exceeding the limits of a blameless defence. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Offic. i, 36) that "whoever does not ward off a blow from a fellow <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> when he can, is as much in fault as the striker"; and he quotes the example of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. Again we may reply with <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (QQ. Exod. qu. 2) [Cf. Contra Faust. xxii, 70 that just as "the soil gives <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of its fertility by producing useless herbs before the useful seeds have grown, so this <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> although it gave a sign of great fertility," in so far, to wit, as it was a sign of the power whereby he was to deliver his people.

<p>With regard to Phinees the reply is that he did this out of zeal for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by Divine inspiration; or because though not as yet <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a>, he was nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest's</a> son, and this judgment was his concern as of the other judges, to whom this was commanded [<a href="../bible/exo022.htm#verse20">Exodus 22:20</a>; <a href="../bible/lev020.htm">Leviticus 20</a>; <a href="../bible/deu013.htm">Deuteronomy 13</a> and <a href="../bible/deu017.htm">17</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a> is subject to the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, even as the body is subject to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Consequently the judgment is not usurped if the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> authority interferes in those temporal matters that are subject to the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> authority or which have been committed to the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> by the temporal authority.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> are perfections of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, and consequently their absence does not make a judgment to be usurped, as in the absence of public authority which gives a judgment its coercive force.
