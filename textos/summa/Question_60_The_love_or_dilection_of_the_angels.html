<h1>Question 60. The love or dilection of the angels</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1060.htm#article1"> Is there natural love in the angels?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1060.htm#article2"> Is there in them love of choice?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1060.htm#article3"> Does the angel love himself with natural love or with love of choice?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1060.htm#article4"> Does one angel love another with natural love as he loves himself?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1060.htm#article5"> Does the angel love God more than self with natural love?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether there is natural love or dilection in an angel?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is no <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love or dilection in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love is contradistinguished from <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> love, as stated by <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. iv). But an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> love is <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>. Therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, those who love with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love are more acted upon than active in themselves; for nothing has control over its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are not acted upon, but act of themselves; because they possess <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, as was shown above (Question 59, Article 3). Consequently there is no <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love in them.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every love is either ordinate or inordinate. Now ordinate love belongs to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; while inordinate love belongs to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. But neither of these belongs to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; because <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is above <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, while <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> is against <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore there is no <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Love results from <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; for, nothing is loved except it be first <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. x, 1,2). But there is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Therefore there is also <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We must <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> place <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. In evidence of this we must bear in mind that what comes first is always sustained in what comes after it. Now <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> comes before <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of every subject is its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Consequently whatever belongs to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> must be preserved likewise in such subjects as have <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. But it is common to every <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to have some inclination; and this is its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> or love. This inclination is found to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> differently in different <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>; but in each according to its mode. Consequently, in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> there is to be found a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination coming from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, according to the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; but in a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> devoid of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, only according to the tendency of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to something. Therefore, since an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, there must be a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love in his will.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">Intellectual</a> love is contradistinguished from that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love, which is merely <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, in so far as it belongs to a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which has not likewise the perfection of either sense or <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> All things in the world are moved to act by something else except the First Agent, Who acts in such a manner that He is in no way moved to act by another; and in Whom <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and will are the same. So there is nothing unfitting in an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> being moved to act in so far as such <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination is implanted in him by the Author of his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Yet he is not so moved to act that he does not act himself, because he has <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is always <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, so is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love well regulated; because <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love is nothing else than the inclination implanted in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> by its Author. To say that a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination is not well regulated, is to derogate from the Author of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Yet the rectitude of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love is different from the rectitude of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: because the one rectitude perfects the other; even so the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is of one kind, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of infused or acquired <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is of another.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether there is love of choice in the angels?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is no love of choice in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For love of choice appears to be rational love; since choice follows counsel, which lies in inquiry, as stated in Ethic. iii, 3. Now rational love is contrasted with <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, which is proper to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as is said (Div. Nom. iv). Therefore there is no love of choice in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have only <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> besides such as is infused: since they do not proceed from principles to acquire the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of conclusions. Hence they are disposed to everything they can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, as our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is disposed towards first principles, which it can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>. Now love follows <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, as has been already stated (1; 16, 1). Consequently, besides their infused love, there is only <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Therefore there is no love of choice in them.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> We neither <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> nor demerit by our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> acts. But by their love the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> or demerit. Therefore there is love of choice in them.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love, and a love of choice. Their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love is the principle of their love of choice; because, what belongs to that which precedes, has always the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a principle. Wherefore, since <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is first in everything, what belongs to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> must be a principle in everything.

<p>This is clearly evident in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, with respect to both his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and his will. For the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> principles <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>; and from such <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> comes the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of conclusions, which are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by him not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, but by discovery, or by teaching. In like manner, the end acts in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in the same way as the principle does in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as is laid down in Phys. ii, text. 89. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> tends <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> to its last end; for every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> wills <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>: and all other desires are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by this <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> desire; since whatever a man wills he wills on account of the end. Therefore the love of that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which a man <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> wills as an end, is his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love; but the love which comes of this, which is of something loved for the end's sake, is the love of choice.

<p>There is however a difference on the part of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and on the part of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Because, as was stated already (59, 2), the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is brought about by the inward presence of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> within the knower. It comes of the imperfection of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that his mind does not simultaneously possess all things capable of being understood, but only a few things from which he is moved in a measure to grasp other things. The act of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> faculty, on the contrary, follows the inclination of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> towards things; some of which are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in themselves, and consequently are appetible in themselves; others being <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> only in relation to something else, and being appetible on account of something else. Consequently it does not argue imperfection in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> desiring, for him to seek one thing <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> as his end, and something else from choice as ordained to such end. Therefore, since the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> is perfect, only <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and not deductive <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is to be found in them, but there is to be found in them both <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love and love of choice.

<p>In saying all this, we are passing over all that regards things which are above <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, since <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not the sufficient principle thereof: but we shall speak of them later on (62).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Not all love of choice is rational love, according as rational is distinguished from <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> love. For rational love is so called which follows deductive <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: but, as was said above (59, 3, ad 1), when treating of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, every choice does not follow a discursive act of the reason; but only <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> choice. Consequently the conclusion does not follow.

<p>The reply to the second objection follows from what has been said.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the angel loves himself with both natural love, and love of choice?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> does not love himself both with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love and a love of choice. For, as was said (2), <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love regards the end itself; while love of choice regards the means to the end. But the same thing, with regard to the same, cannot be both the end and a means to the end. Therefore <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love and the love of choice cannot have the same object.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> observes (Div. Nom. iv): "Love is a uniting and a binding power." But uniting and binding imply various things brought together. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> cannot love himself.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, love is a kind of movement. But every movement tends towards something else. Therefore it seems that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> cannot love himself with either <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> or elective love.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ix, 8): "Love for others comes of love for oneself."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since the object of love is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is to be found both in <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> and in <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, as is clear from Ethic. i, 6, a thing may be loved in two ways; first of all as a subsisting <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and secondly as an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> or inherent <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. That is loved as a subsisting <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is so loved that we wish well to it. But that which we wish unto another, is loved as an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> or inherent <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: thus <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is loved, not that any <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> may come to it but that it may be possessed. This kind of love has been called by the name "<a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>" while the first is called "friendship."

<p>Now it is manifest that in things devoid of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, everything <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> seeks to procure what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for itself; as fire seeks to mount upwards. Consequently both <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> seek their own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and perfection. This is to love self. Hence <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> love self, in so far as by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> each desires what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for self. On the other hand, each loves self with the love of choice, in so far as from choice he wishes for something which will benefit himself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is not under the same but under quite different aspects that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> or a man loves self with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and with elective love, as was observed above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As to be one is better than to be united, so there is more oneness in love which is directed to self than in love which unites one to others. <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> used the terms "uniting" and "binding" in order to show the derivation of love from self to things outside self; as uniting is derived from unity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As love is an action which remains within the agent, so also is it a movement which abides within the lover, but does not of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> tend towards something else; yet it can be reflected back upon the lover so that he loves himself; just as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is reflected back upon the knower, in such a way that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> himself.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether an angel loves another with natural love as he loves himself?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> does not love another with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love as he loves himself. For love follows <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. But an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> another as he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> himself: because he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> himself by his <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, while he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> another by his similitude, as was said above (56, 1,2). Therefore it seems that one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> does not love another with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love as he loves himself.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is more powerful than the effect; and the principle than what is derived from it. But love for another comes of love for self, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ix, 8). Therefore one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> does not love another as himself, but loves himself more.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love is of something as an end, and is unremovable. But no <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is the end of another; and again, such love can be severed from him, as is the case with the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, who have no love for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Therefore an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> does not love another with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love as he loves himself.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> That seems to be a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> property which is found in all, even in such as devoid of reason. But, "every beast loves its like," as is said, <a href="../bible/sir013.htm#verse19">Sirach 13:19</a>. Therefore an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> loves another as he loves himself.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was observed (3), both <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> love self. Now what is one with a thing, is that thing itself: consequently every thing loves what is one with itself. So, if this be one with it by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> union, it loves it with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love; but if it be one with it by non-<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> union, then it loves it with non-<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love. Thus a man loves his fellow townsman with a social love, while he loves a blood relation with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> affection, in so far as he is one with him in the principle of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> generation.

<p>Now it is evident that what is generically or specifically one with another, is the one according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. And so everything loves another which is one with it in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, with a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> affection, in so far as it loves its own <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. This is manifest even in things devoid of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: for fire has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination to communicate its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> to another thing, wherein consists this other thing's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; as it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> inclined to seek its own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, namely, to be borne upwards.

<p>So then, it must be said that one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> loves another with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> affection, in so far as he is one with him in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But so far as an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> has something else in common with another <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, or differs from him in other respects, he does not love him with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The expression 'as himself' can in one way qualify the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and the love on the part of the one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and loved: and thus one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> another as himself, because he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the other to be even as he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> himself to be. In another way the expression can qualify the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and the love on the part of the knower and lover. And thus one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> another as himself, because he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> himself by his <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, and the other not by the other's <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. In like manner he does not love another as he loves himself, because he loves himself by his own will; but he does not love another by the other's will.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The expression "as" does not denote equality, but likeness. For since <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> affection rests upon <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> unity, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> loves less what is less one with him. Consequently he loves more what is numerically one with himself, than what is one only generically or specifically. But it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> for him to have a like love for another as for himself, in this respect, that as he loves self in wishing well to self, so he loves another in wishing well to him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Natural love is said to be of the end, not as of that end to which <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is willed, but rather as of that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which one wills for oneself, and in consequence for another, as united to oneself. Nor can such <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love be stripped from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, without their still retaining a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> affection towards the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, in so far as they share the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> with them. But they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> them, in so far as they are unlike them according to righteousness and unrighteousness.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether an angel by natural love loves God more than he loves himself?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> does not love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love more than he loves himself. For, as was stated (4), <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love rests upon <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> union. Now the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is far above the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore, according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> less than self, or even than another <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "That on account of which a thing is such, is yet more so." But every one loves another with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love for his own sake: because one thing loves another as <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for itself. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> does not love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more than self with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is self-centered in its operation; for we behold every agent acting <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> for its own preservation. But <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature's</a> operation would not be self-centered were it to tend towards anything else more than to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> itself. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> does not love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more than himself from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it is proper to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more than self. But to love from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; for "it is poured out upon their hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> Who is given to them," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xii, 9). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more than themselves by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love lasts while <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> endures. But the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more than self does not remain in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> or <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv), "Two loves have made two cities; namely love of self unto the contempt of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has made the earthly city; while love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> unto the contempt of self has made the heavenly city." Therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more than self.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> All the moral precepts of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> come of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But the precept of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more than self is a moral precept of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Therefore, it is of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Consequently from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more than himself.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There have been some who maintained that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more than himself with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love, both as to the love of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, through his seeking the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for himself rather than his own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and, in a fashion, as to the love of friendship, in so far as he <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> desires a greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than to himself; because he <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> wishes <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while as for himself, he wills to have his own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But absolutely speaking, out of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love he loves himself more than he does <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because he <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> loves himself before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and with greater intensity.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsity</a> of such an opinion stands in evidence, if one but consider whither <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> movement tends in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order of things; because the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> tendency of things devoid of reason shows the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination residing in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now, in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things, everything which, as such, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> belongs to another, is principally, and more strongly inclined to that other to which it belongs, than towards itself. Such a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> tendency is evidenced from things which are moved according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: because "according as a thing is moved <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, it has an inborn aptitude to be thus moved," as stated in Phys. ii, text. 78. For we observe that the part <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> exposes itself in order to safeguard the whole; as, for instance, the hand is without deliberation exposed to the blow for the whole body's safety. And since reason copies <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, we find the same inclination among the social <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; for it behooves the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> citizen to expose himself to the danger of death for the public weal of the state; and if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> were a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> part of the city, then such inclination would be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to him.

<p>Consequently, since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the universal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and under this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> both <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> and all creatures are comprised, because every creature in regard to its entire being <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it follows that from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> alike love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> before themselves and with a greater love. Otherwise, if either of them loved self more than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it would follow that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love would be perverse, and that it would not be perfected but destroyed by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Such reasoning holds good of things adequately divided whereof one is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the other; for in such natures each loves itself <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> more than it does the other, inasmuch as it is more one with itself than it is with the other. But where one is the whole <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the other, that one is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> more loved than self; because, as we said above, each part <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> loves the whole more than itself: and each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> loves the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> more than its own <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not only the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but is absolutely the universal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; hence everything in its own way <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more than itself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When it is said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is loved by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> "in so far" as He is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, if the expression "in so far" denotes an end, then it is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>; for he does not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for his own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake. If it denotes the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of love on the lover's part, then it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; for it would not be in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of anyone to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, except from this--that everything is dependent on that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Nature's operation is self-centered not merely as to certain particular details, but much more as to what is common; for everything is inclined to preserve not merely its <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuality</a>, but likewise its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. And much more has everything a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination towards what is the absolutely universal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in so far as He is the universal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, from Whom every <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> depends, is loved by everything with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love. So far as He is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which of its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> beatifies all with <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> beatitude, He is love with the love of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> and universal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> are one and the same, all who behold <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> are by the same movement of love moved towards the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> as it is distinct from other things, and according as it is the universal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. And because He is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> loved by all so far as He is the universal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it is impossible that whoever sees Him in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> should not love Him. But such as do not behold His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him by some particular effects, which are sometimes opposed to their will. So in this way they are said to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; yet nevertheless, so far as He is the universal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of all, every thing <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more than itself.
