<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether a sacrament is a kind of sign?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is not a kind of sign. For sacrament appears to be derived from "sacring" [sacrando; just as medicament, from "medicando" [healing]. But this seems to be of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> rather than of a sign. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is a kind of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> rather than a kind of sign.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, sacrament seems to signify something hidden, according to <a href="../bible/tob012.htm#verse7">Tobit 12:7</a>: "It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to hide the secret [sacramentum] of a king"; and <a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse9">Ephesians 3:9</a>: "What is the dispensation of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> [sacramenti] which hath been hidden from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." But that which is hidden, seems foreign to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a sign; for "a sign is that which conveys something else to the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, besides the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> which it impresses on the senses," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> explains (De Doctr. Christ. ii). Therefore it seems that a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is not a kind of sign.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is sometimes called a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>: for it is written in the Decretals (Caus. xxii, qu. 5): "Children who have not attained the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> must not be <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to swear: and whoever has foresworn himself once, must no more be a witness, nor be allowed to take a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>," i.e. an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. But an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is not a kind of sign, therefore it seems that a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is not a kind of sign.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei x): "The visible sacrifice is the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, i.e. the sacred sign, of the invisible sacrifice."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> All things that are ordained to one, even in different ways, can be denominated from it: thus, from health which is in an animal, not only is the animal said to be healthy through being the subject of health: but medicine also is said to be healthy through producing health; diet through preserving it; and urine, through being a sign of health. Consequently, a thing may be called a "sacrament," either from having a certain hidden sanctity, and in this sense a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is a "sacred secret"; or from having some relationship to this sanctity, which relationship may be that of a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, or of a sign or of any other relation. But now we are speaking of <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> in a special sense, as implying the habitude of sign: and in this way a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is a kind of sign.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Because medicine is an efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of health, consequently whatever things are denominated from medicine are to be referred to some first active <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: so that a medicament implies a certain <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>. But sanctity from which a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is denominated, is not there taken as an efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but rather as a formal or a final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Therefore it does not follow that a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> need always imply <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument considers sacrament in the sense of a "sacred secret." Now not only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> but also the king's, secret, is said to be sacred and to be a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>: because according to the ancients, whatever it was unlawful to lay <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> hands on was said to be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> or sacrosanct, such as the city walls, and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of high rank. Consequently those secrets, whether Divine or <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, which it is unlawful to violate by making them <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to anybody whatever, are called "sacred secrets or <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Even an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> has a certain relation to sacred things, in so far as it consists in calling a sacred thing to witness. And in this sense it is called a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>: not in the sense in which we speak of <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> now; the word "sacrament" being thus used not equivocally but <a href="../cathen/01449a.htm">analogically</a>, i.e. by reason of a different relation to the one thing, viz. something sacred.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether every sign of a holy thing is a sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that not every sign of a sacred thing is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. For all sensible creatures are signs of sacred things; according to <a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse20">Romans 1:20</a>: "The invisible things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made." And yet all sensible things cannot be called <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Therefore not every sign of a sacred thing is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever was done under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was a figure of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Who is the "Holy of Holies" (<a href="../bible/dan009.htm#verse24">Daniel 9:24</a>), according to <a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse11">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>: "All (these) things happened to them in figure"; and <a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse17">Colossians 2:17</a>: "Which are a shadow of things to come, but the body is Christ's." And yet not all that was done by the Fathers of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, not even all the ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, were <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, but only in certain special cases, as stated in I-II, 101, 4. Therefore it seems that not every sign of a sacred thing is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, even in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> many things are done in sign of some sacred thing; yet they are not called <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>; such as sprinkling with <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> water, the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of an altar, and such like. Therefore not every sign of a sacred thing is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A definition is convertible with the thing defined. Now some define a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> as being "the sign of a sacred thing"; moreover, this is clear from the passage quoted above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>) from <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>. Therefore it seems that every sign of a sacred thing is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Signs are given to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, to whom it is proper to discover the unknown by means of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Consequently a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> properly so called is that which is the sign of some sacred thing pertaining to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; so that properly speaking a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as considered by us now, is defined as being the "sign of a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> thing so far as it makes men <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Sensible creatures signify something <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, viz. Divine wisdom and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> inasmuch as these are <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> in themselves; but not inasmuch as we are made <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> by them. Therefore they cannot be called <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> as we understand <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> now.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Some things pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> signified the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> considered as <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> in Himself. Others signified His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> considered as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>; thus the sacrifice of the Paschal Lamb signified Christ's Sacrifice whereby we are made <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>: and such like are properly styled <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Names are given to things considered in reference to their end and state of completeness. Now a disposition is not an end, whereas perfection is. Consequently things that signify disposition to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> are not called <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and with regard to these the objection is verified: only those are called <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which signify the perfection of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether a sacrament is a sign of one thing only?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is a sign of one thing only. For that which signifies many things is an ambiguous sign, and consequently occasions deception: this is clearly seen in equivocal words. But all deception should be removed from the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, according to <a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse8">Colossians 2:8</a>: "Beware lest any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cheat you by <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and vain deceit." Therefore it seems that a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is not a sign of several things.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> signifies a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> thing in so far as it makes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>. But there is only one <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, viz. the blood of Christ; according to <a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse12">Hebrews 13:12</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, that He might sanctify the people by His own blood, suffered without the gate." Therefore it seems that a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> does not signify several things.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it has been said above (2, ad 3) that a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> signifies properly the very end of sanctification. Now the end of sanctification is <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse22">Romans 6:22</a>: "You have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end life everlasting." Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> signify one thing only, viz. <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Sacrament of the Altar</a>, two things are signified, viz. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body, and <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">Christ's mystical body</a>; as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Liber Sent. Prosper.).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>) a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> properly speaking is that which is ordained to signify our sanctification. In which three things may be considered; viz. the very <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our sanctification, which is <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's passion</a>; the form of our sanctification, which is <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; and the ultimate end of our sanctification, which is <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>. And all these are signified by the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Consequently a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is a sign that is both a reminder of the past, i.e. the passion of Christ; and an indication of that which is effected in us by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> passion, i.e. <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; and a prognostic, that is, a foretelling of future <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Then is a sign ambiguous and the occasion of deception, when it signifies many things not ordained to one another. But when it signifies many things inasmuch as, through being mutually ordained, they form one thing, then the sign is not ambiguous but certain: thus this word "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" signifies the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body inasmuch as together they form the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. In this way a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> signifies the three things aforesaid, inasmuch as by being in a certain order they are one thing.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Since a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> signifies that which sanctifies, it must needs signify the effect, which is implied in the sanctifying <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> as such.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is enough for a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> that it signify that perfection which consists in the form, nor is it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that it should signify only that perfection which is the end.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether a sacrament is always something sensible?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is not always something sensible. Because, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Prior. Anal. ii), every effect is a sign of its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But just as there are some sensible effects, so are there some intelligible effects; thus science is the effect of a demonstration. Therefore not every sign is sensible. Now all that is required for a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is something that is a sign of some sacred thing, inasmuch as thereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is sanctified, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Therefore something sensible is not required for a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> belong to the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> and the Divine worship. But sensible things do not seem to belong to the Divine worship: for we are told (<a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse24">John 4:24</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a spirit; and they that <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> Him, must <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> Him in spirit and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>"; and (<a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse17">Romans 14:17</a>) that "the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> is not meat and drink." Therefore sensible things are not required for the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Lib. Arb. ii) that "sensible things are goods of least account, since without them <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can live aright." But the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, as we shall show farther on (61, 1): so that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot live aright without them. Therefore sensible things are not required for the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. lxxx super Joan.): "The word is added to the element and this becomes a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>"; and he is speaking there of water which is a sensible element. Therefore sensible things are required for the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Divine wisdom provides for each thing according to its mode; hence it is written (<a href="../bible/wis008.htm#verse1">Wisdom 8:1</a>) that "she . . . ordereth all things sweetly": wherefore also we are told (<a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse15">Matthew 25:15</a>) that she "gave to everyone according to his proper ability." Now it is part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to acquire <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the intelligible from the sensible. But a sign is that by means of which one attains to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of something else. Consequently, since the sacred things which are signified by the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, are the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and intelligible goods by means of which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is sanctified, it follows that the sacramental signs consist in sensible things: just as in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Divine Scriptures</a> <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things are set before us under the guise of things sensible. And hence it is that sensible things are required for the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>; as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> also proves in his book on the heavenly <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> (Coel. Hier. i).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The name and definition of a thing is taken principally from that which belongs to a thing primarily and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>: and not from that which belongs to it through something else. Now a sensible effect being the primary and direct object of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (since all our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> springs from the senses) by its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> leads to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of something else: whereas intelligible effects are not such as to be able to lead us to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of something else, except in so far as they are manifested by some other thing, i.e. by certain sensibles. It is for this reason that the name sign is given primarily and principally to things which are offered to the senses; hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. ii) that a sign "is that which conveys something else to the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, besides the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> which it impresses on the senses." But intelligible effects do not partake of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a sign except in so far as they are pointed out by certain signs. And in this way, too, certain things which are not sensible are termed <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> as it were, in so far as they are signified by certain sensible things, of which we shall treat further on (63, 1, ad 2; 3, ad 2; 73, 6; 74, 1, ad 3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Sensible things considered in their own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> do not belong to the worship or <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>: but considered only as signs of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things in which the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> consists.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> speaks there of sensible things, considered in their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; but not as employed to signify <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, which are the highest goods.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether determinate things are required for a sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that determinate things are not required for a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. For sensible things are required in <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> for the purpose of signification, as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>). But nothing hinders the same thing being signified by divers sensible things: thus in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Scripture</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is signified metaphorically, sometimes by a stone (<a href="../bible/2sa022.htm#verse2">2 Samuel 22:2</a>; <a href="../bible/zec003.htm#verse9">Zechariah 3:9</a>; <a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse4">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>; <a href="../bible/rev004.htm#verse3">Apocalypse 4:3</a>); sometimes by a lion (<a href="../bible/isa031.htm#verse4">Isaiah 31:4</a>; <a href="../bible/rev005.htm#verse5">Apocalypse 5:5</a>); sometimes by the sun (<a href="../bible/isa060.htm#verse19">Isaiah 60:19-20</a>; <a href="../bible/mal004.htm#verse2">Malachi 4:2</a>), or by something similar. Therefore it seems that divers things can be suitable to the same sacrament. Therefore determinate things are not required for the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the health of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is more <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> than that of the body. But in bodily medicines, which are ordained to the health of the body, one thing can be substituted for another which happens to be wanting. Therefore much more in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, which are <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> remedies ordained to the health of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, can one thing be substituted for another when this happens to be lacking.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is not fitting that the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> be restricted by the Divine Law: still less by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who came to save all. But in the state of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">Law of nature</a> determinate things were not required in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, but were put to that use through a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, as appears from <a href="../bible/gen028.htm">Genesis 28</a>, where <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> vowed that he would offer to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> and peace-offerings. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should not have been restricted, especially under the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, to the use of any determinate thing in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse5">John 3:5</a>): "Unless a man be born again of water and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, he cannot enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In the use of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> two things may be considered, namely, the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the sanctification of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: the former of which pertains to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as referred to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the latter pertains to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in reference to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Now it is not for anyone to determine that which is in the power of another, but only that which is in his own power. Since, therefore, the sanctification of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is in the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who sanctifies, it is not for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to decide what things should be used for his sanctification, but this should be determined by Divine institution. Therefore in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, by which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is sanctified according to <a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse11">1 Corinthians 6:11</a>, "You are washed, you are sanctified," we must use those things which are determined by Divine institution.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Though the same thing can be signified by divers signs, yet to determine which sign must be used belongs to the signifier. Now it is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who signifies <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things to us by means of the sensible things in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and of similitudes in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. And consequently, just as the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> decides by what similitudes <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things are to be signified in certain passages of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>, so also must it be determined by Divine institution what things are to be employed for the purpose of signification in this or that sacrament.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Sensible things are endowed with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers conducive to the health of the body: and therefore if two of them have the same <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, it matters not which we use. Yet they are ordained unto sanctification not through any power that they possess <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, but only in virtue of the Divine institution. And therefore it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should determine the sensible things to be employed in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Faust. xix), diverse <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> suit different times; just as different times are signified by different parts of the verb, viz. present, past, and future. Consequently, just as under the state of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">Law of nature</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was moved by inward instinct and without any outward <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, to worship <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so also the sensible things to be employed in the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> were determined by inward <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a>. But later on it became <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to be given (to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>) from without: both because the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">Law of nature</a> had become obscured by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and in order to signify more expressly the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by which the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> is sanctified. And hence the need for those things to be determinate, of which men have to make use in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Nor is the way of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> narrowed thereby: because the things which need to be used in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, are either in everyone's possession or can be had with little trouble.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether words are required for the signification of the sacraments?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that words are not required for the signification of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Faust. xix): "What else is a corporeal sacrament but a kind of visible word?" Wherefore to add words to the sensible things in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> seems to be the same as to add words to words. But this is superfluous. Therefore words are not required besides the sensible things in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is some one thing, but it does not seem possible to make one thing of those that belong to different genera. Since, therefore, sensible things and words are of different genera, for sensible things are the product of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but words, of reason; it seems that in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, words are not required besides sensible things.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> succeed those of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>: since "the former were instituted when the latter were abolished," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Faust. xix). But no form of words was required in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. Therefore neither is it required in those of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse25">Ephesians 5:25-26</a>): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> loved the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and delivered Himself up for it; that He might sanctify it, cleansing it by the laver of water in the word of life." And <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. xxx in Joan.): "The word is added to the element, and this becomes a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, as stated above (2,3), are employed as signs for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> sanctification. Consequently they can be considered in three ways: and in each way it is fitting for words to be added to the sensible signs. For in the first place they can be considered in regard to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sanctification, which is the Word <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>: to Whom the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> have a certain conformity, in that the word is joined to the sensible sign, just as in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is united to sensible flesh.

<p>Secondly, <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> may be considered on the part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who is sanctified, and who is composed of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body: to whom the sacramental remedy is adjusted, since it touches the body through the sensible element, and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the words. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. lxxx in Joan.) on <a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse3">John 15:3</a>, "Now you are clean by reason of the word," etc.: "Whence hath water this so great <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, to touch the body and wash the heart, but by the word doing it, not because it is spoken, but because it is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>?"

<p>Thirdly, a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> may be considered on the part of the sacramental signification. Now <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. ii) that "words are the principal signs used by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>"; because words can be formed in various ways for the purpose of signifying various <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> concepts, so that we are able to express our thoughts with greater distinctness by means of words. And therefore in order to insure the perfection of sacramental signification it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to determine the signification of the sensible things by means of certain words. For water may signify both a cleansing by reason of its humidity, and refreshment by reason of its being cool: but when we say, "I <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> thee," it is clear that we use water in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in order to signify a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> cleansing.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The sensible elements of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are called words by way of a certain likeness, in so far as they partake of a certain significative power, which resides principally in the very words, as stated above. Consequently it is not a superfluous repetition to add words to the visible element in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>; because one determines the other, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although words and other sensible things are not in the same genus, considered in their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, yet have they something in common as to the thing signified by them: which is more perfectly done in words than in other things. Wherefore in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, words and things, like form and <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, combine in the formation of one thing, in so far as the signification of things is completed by means of words, as above stated. And under words are comprised also sensible actions, such as cleansing and anointing and such like: because they have a like signification with the things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Faust. xix), the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of things present should be different from <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of things to come. Now the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> foretold the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Consequently they did not signify <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> so clearly as the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, which flow from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself, and have a certain likeness to Him, as stated above. Nevertheless in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, certain words were used in things pertaining to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, both by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, who were the ministers of those <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, according to <a href="../bible/num006.htm#verse23">Numbers 6:23-24</a>: "Thus shall you <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and you shall say to them: The Lord <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> thee," etc.; and by those who made use of those <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, according to <a href="../bible/deu026.htm#verse3">Deuteronomy 26:3</a>: "I profess this day before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>," etc.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether determinate words are required in the sacraments?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that determinate words are not required in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. For as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Peri Herm. i), "words are not the same for all." But <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, which is sought through the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, is the same for all. Therefore determinate words are not required in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, words are required in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> forasmuch as they are the principal means of signification, as stated above (<a href="#6">Article 6</a>). But it happens that various words mean the same. Therefore determinate words are not required in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, corruption of anything changes its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But some corrupt the pronunciation of words, and yet it is not credible that the sacramental effect is hindered thereby; else unlettered men and stammerers, in conferring <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, would frequently do so invalidly. Therefore it seems that determinate words are not required in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> used determinate words in <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, when He said (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse26">Matthew 26:26</a>): "This is My Body." Likewise He commanded His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> under a form of determinate words, saying (<a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew 28:19</a>): "Go ye and teach all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (6, ad 2), in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> the words are as the form, and sensible things are as the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Now in all things composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, the determining principle is on the part of the form, which is as it were the end and terminus of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Consequently for the being of a thing the need of a determinate form is prior to the need of determinate <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: for determinate <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is needed that it may be adapted to the determinate form. Since, therefore, in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> determinate sensible things are required, which are as the sacramental <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, much more is there need in them of a determinate form of words.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. lxxx super Joan.), the word operates in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> "not because it is spoken," i.e. not by the outward sound of the voice, "but because it is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>" in accordance with the sense of the words which is held by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. And this sense is indeed the same for all, though the same words as to their sound be not used by all. Consequently no <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in what language this sense is expressed, the sacrament is complete.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although it happens in every language that various words signify the same thing, yet one of those words is that which those who speak that language use principally and more commonly to signify that particular thing: and this is the word which should be used for the sacramental signification. So also among sensible things, that one is used for the sacramental signification which is most commonly employed for the action by which the sacramental effect is signified: thus water is most commonly used by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> for bodily cleansing, by which the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> cleansing is signified: and therefore water is employed as the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If he who corrupts the pronunciation of the sacramental words--does so on purpose, he does not seem to intend to do what the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> intends: and thus the sacrament seems to be defective. But if he do this through <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> or a slip of the tongue, and if he so far mispronounce the words as to deprive them of sense, the sacrament seems to be defective. This would be the case especially if the mispronunciation be in the beginning of a word, for instance, if one were to say "in nomine matris" instead of "in nomine Patris." If, however, the sense of the words be not entirely lost by this mispronunciation, the sacrament is complete. This would be the case principally if the end of a word be mispronounced; for instance, if one were to say "patrias et filias." For although the words thus mispronounced have no appointed meaning, yet we allow them an accommodated meaning corresponding to the usual forms of speech. And so, although the sensible sound is changed, yet the sense remains the same.

<p>What has been said about the various mispronunciations of words, either at the beginning or at the end, holds forasmuch as with us a change at the beginning of a word changes the meaning, whereas a change at the end generally speaking does not effect such a change: whereas with the Greeks the sense is changed also in the beginning of words in the conjugation of verbs.

<p>Nevertheless the principle point to observe is the extent of the corruption entailed by mispronunciation: for in either case it may be so little that it does not alter the sense of the words; or so great that it destroys it. But it is easier for the one to happen on the part of the beginning of the words, and the other at the end.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether it is lawful to add anything to the words in which the sacramental form consists?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that it is not lawful to add anything to the words in which the sacramental form consists. For these sacramental words are not of less importance than are the words of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Scripture</a>. But it is not lawful to add anything to, or to take anything from, the words of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Scripture</a>: for it is written (<a href="../bible/deu004.htm#verse2">Deuteronomy 4:2</a>): "You shall not add to the word that I speak to you, neither shall you take away from it"; and (<a href="../bible/rev022.htm#verse18">Apocalypse 22:18-19</a>): "I testify to everyone that heareth the words of the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of this book: if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall add to these things, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall add to him the plagues written in this book. And if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall take away . . . <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall take away his part out of the book of life." Therefore it seems that neither is it lawful to add anything to, or to take anything from, the sacramental forms.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> words are by way of form, as stated above (6, ad 2; 7). But any addition or subtraction in forms changes the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as also in numbers (Metaph. viii). Therefore it seems that if anything be added to or subtracted from a sacramental form, it will not be the same sacrament.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as the sacramental form demands a certain number of words, so does it require that these words should be pronounced in a certain order and without interruption. If therefore, the sacrament is not rendered invalid by addition or subtraction of words, in like manner it seems that neither is it, if the words be pronounced in a different order or with interruptions.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Certain words are inserted by some in the sacramental forms, which are not inserted by others: thus the Latins <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> under this form: "I <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>"; whereas the Greeks use the following form: "The servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, N . . . is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of the Father," etc. Yet both confer the sacrament validly. Therefore it is lawful to add something to, or to take something from, the sacramental forms.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> With regard to all the variations that may occur in the sacramental forms, two points seem to call for our attention. one is on the part of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who says the words, and whose <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as will be explained further on (64, 8). Wherefore if he intends by such addition or suppression to perform a rite other from that which is recognized by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, it seems that the sacrament is invalid: because he seems not to intend to do what the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does.

<p>The other point to be considered is the meaning of the words. For since in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, the words produce an effect according to the sense which they convey, as stated above (7, ad 1), we must see whether the change of words destroys the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> sense of the words: because then the sacrament is clearly rendered invalid. Now it is clear, if any <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> part of the sacramental form be suppressed, that the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> sense of the words is destroyed; and consequently the sacrament is invalid. Wherefore Didymus says (De Spir. Sanct. ii): "If anyone attempt to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> in such a way as to omit one of the aforesaid names," i.e. of the Father, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, "his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> will be invalid." But if that which is omitted be not a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> part of the form, such an omission does not destroy the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> sense of the words, nor consequently the validity of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Thus in the form of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>--"For this is My Body," the omission of the word "for" does not destroy the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> sense of the words, nor consequently <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the sacrament to be invalid; although perhaps he who makes the omission may <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from negligence or contempt.

<p>Again, it is possible to add something that destroys the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> sense of the words: for instance, if one were to say: "I <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> thee in the name of the Father Who is greater, and of the Son Who is less," with which form the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>: and consequently such an addition makes the sacrament invalid. But if the addition be such as not to destroy the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> sense, the sacrament is not rendered invalid. Nor does it matter whether this addition be made at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end: For instance, if one were to say, "I <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> thee in the name of the Father Almighty, and of the only Begotten Son, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, the Paraclete," the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> would be valid; and in like manner if one were to say, "I <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>"; and may the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> succour thee, the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> would be valid.

<p>Perhaps, however, if one were to say, "I <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin Mary</a>," the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> would be void; because it is written (<a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse13">1 Corinthians 1:13</a>): "Was <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> crucified for you or were you <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>?" But this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> if the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> be to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> in the name of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> as in the name of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, by which <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>: for such a sense would be contrary to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and would therefore render the sacrament invalid: whereas if the addition, "and in the name of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>" be understood, not as if the name of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> effected anything in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, but as intimating that her intercession may help the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> to preserve the baptismal <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, then the sacrament is not rendered void.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is not lawful to add anything to the words of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Scripture</a> as regards the sense; but many words are added by Doctors by way of explanation of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>. Nevertheless, it is not lawful to add even words to <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Scripture</a> as though such words were a part thereof, for this would amount to forgery. It would amount to the same if anyone were to pretend that something is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to a sacramental form, which is not so.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Words belong to a sacramental form by reason of the sense signified by them. Consequently any addition or suppression of words which does not add to or take from the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> sense, does not destroy the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If the words are interrupted to such an extent that the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the speaker is interrupted, the sacramental sense is destroyed, and consequently, the validity of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. But this is not the case if the interruption of the speaker is so slight, that his <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> and the sense of the words is not interrupted.

<p>The same is to be said of a change in the order of the words. Because if this destroys the sense of the words, the sacrament is invalidated: as happens when a negation is made to precede or follow a word. But if the order is so changed that the sense of the words does not vary, the sacrament is not invalidated, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher's</a> dictum: "Nouns and verbs mean the same though they be transposed" (Peri Herm. x).
