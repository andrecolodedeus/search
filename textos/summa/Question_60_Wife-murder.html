<h1>Question 60. Wife-murder</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5060.htm#article1"> Is it lawful, in a certain case, to kill one's wife?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5060.htm#article2"> Is wife-murder an impediment to marriage?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether it is lawful for a man to kill his wife if she be discovered in the act of adultery?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem lawful for a man to kill his wife if she be discovered in the act of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> commanded <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulterous</a> wives to be stoned. Now it is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to fulfill the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>. Neither therefore is it a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to kill one's own wife if she be an adulteress.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> can rightly do, can be rightly done by one whom the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> has commissioned to do it. But the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> can rightly kill an <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulterous</a> wife or any other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> deserving of death. Since then the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> has commissioned the husband to kill his wife if she be discovered in the act of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, it would seem that he can rightly do so.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the husband has greater power over his <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulterous</a> wife than over the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who committed <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> with her. Now if the husband strike a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> whom he found with his wife he is not <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. Therefore it would seem lawful for him even to kill his own wife if she be discovered in <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the husband is bound to correct his wife. But correction is given by inflicting a just punishment. Since then the just punishment of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is death, because it is a capital <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it would seem lawful for a husband to kill his <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulterous</a> wife.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 37) that "the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is never bound by the laws of this world, for she has none but a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> sword." Therefore it would seem that he who wishes to belong to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> cannot rightly take advantage of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> which permits a man to kill his wife.

<p>Further, husband and wife are judged on a par. But it is not lawful for a wife to kill her husband if he be discovered in <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. Neither therefore may a husband kill his wife.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It happens in two ways that a husband kills his wife. First, by a civil judgment; and thus there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that a husband, moved by zeal for <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and not by vindictive <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> can, without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, bring a criminal accusation of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> upon his wife before a secular court, and demand that she receive capital punishment as appointed by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; just as it is lawful to accuse a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> or any other crime. Such an accusation however cannot be made in an ecclesiastical court, because, as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 37), the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not wield a material sword. Secondly, a husband can kill his wife himself without her being convicted in court, and thus to kill her outside of the act of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is not lawful, neither according to <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> nor according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, whatever evidence he may have of her <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> however considers it, as though it were lawful, that he should kill her in the very act, not by commanding him to do so, but by not inflicting on him the punishment for <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, on account of the very great provocation which the husband receives by such a <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> to kill his wife. But the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is not bound in this matter by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laws, neither does she acquit him of the debt of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a>, nor of such punishment as may be awarded him by an ecclesiastical tribunal for the reason that he is quit of any punishment to be inflicted by a secular court. Therefore in no case is it lawful for a husband to kill his wife on his own authority.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> has committed the infliction of this punishment not to private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, but to public <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, who are deputed to this by their office. Now the husband is not his wife's judge: wherefore he may not kill her, but may accuse her in the judge's presence.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> has not commissioned the husband to kill his wife by commanding him to do so, for thus he would not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, just as the judge's deputy does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by killing the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a> condemned to death: but it has permitted this by not punishing it. For which reason it has raised certain obstacles to prevent the husband from killing his wife.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that it is lawful simply, but that it is lawful as regards immunity from a particular kind of punishment, since <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> is also a kind of punishment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> There are two kinds of community: the household, such as a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>; and the civil community, such as a city or kingdom. Accordingly, he who presides over the latter kind of community, a king for instance, can punish an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> both by correcting and by exterminating him, for the betterment of the community with whose care he is charged. But he who presides over a community of the first kind, can inflict only corrective punishment, which does not extend beyond the limits of amendment, and these are exceeded by the punishment of death. Wherefore the husband who exercises this kind of control over his wife may not kill her, but he may accuse or chastise her in some other way.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether wife-murder is an impediment to marriage?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that wife-<a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> is not an impediment to marriage. For <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is more directly opposed to marriage than <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> is. Now <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is not an impediment to marriage. Neither therefore is wife-<a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to kill one's mother than one's wife, for it is never lawful to strike one's mother, whereas it is sometimes lawful to strike one's wife. But matricide is not an impediment to marriage. Neither therefore is wife-<a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is a greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for a man to kill another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> wife on account of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> than to kill his own wife, inasmuch as he has less motive and is less concerned with her correction. But he who kills another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> wife is not hindered from marrying. Neither therefore is he who kills his own wife.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, if the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> be removed, the effect is removed. But the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> can be removed by repentance. Therefore the consequent impediment to marriage can be removed also: and consequently it would seem that after he has done penance he is not forbidden to marry.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A canon (caus. xxxiii, qu. ii, can. Interfectores) says: "The slayers of their own wives must be brought back to penance, and they are absolutely forbidden to marry." Further, in whatsoever a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, in that same must he be punished. But he who kills his wife <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against marriage. Therefore he must be punished by being deprived of marriage.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> By the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> decree wife-<a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> is an impediment to marriage. Sometimes however it forbids the contracting of marriage without voiding the contract, when to wit the husband kills his wife on account of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> or even through <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>; nevertheless if there be fear lest he should <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> incontinent, he may be dispensed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> so as to marry lawfully. Sometimes it also voids the contract, as when a man kills his wife in order to marry her with whom he has committed <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, for then the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> declares him simply unfit to marry her, so that if he actually marry her his marriage is void. He is not however hereby rendered simply unfit by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in relation to other <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>: wherefore if he should have <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> another, although he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by disobeying the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> ordinance, the marriage is nevertheless not voided for this reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Murder and <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> in certain cases forbid the contracting of marriage and void the contract, as we say here in regard to wife-<a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, and shall say further on (Sent. iv, 62, 2) in regard to <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. We may also reply that wife-<a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of wedlock, whereas <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of fidelity due to marriage. Hence <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is not more opposed to marriage than wife-<a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, and the argument is based on a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> premiss.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Simply speaking it is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to kill one's mother than one's wife, as also more opposed to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, since a man reveres his mother <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>. Consequently he is less inclined to matricide and more prone to wife-<a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>; and it is to repress this proneness that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has forbidden marriage to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who has murdered his wife.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Such a man does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against marriage as he does who kills his own wife; wherefore the comparison fails.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> It does not follow that because guilt has been remitted therefore the entire punishment is remitted, as evidenced by <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a>. For repentance does not restore a man to his former dignity, although it can restore him to his former state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a>, as stated above (38, 1, ad 3).
