<h1>Question 61. The cardinal virtues</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2061.htm#article1"> Should the moral virtues be called cardinal or principal virtues?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2061.htm#article2"> Their number</a> <li><a href="../summa/2061.htm#article3"> Which are they?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2061.htm#article4"> Do they differ from one another?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2061.htm#article5"> Are they fittingly divided into social, perfecting, perfect, and exemplar virtues?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the moral virtues should be called cardinal or principal virtues?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> should not be called cardinal or principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For "the opposite members of a division are by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> simultaneous" (Categor. x), so that one is not principal rather than another. Now all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are opposite members of the division of the genus "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>." Therefore none of them should be called principal.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the end is principal as compared to the means. But the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are about the end; while the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are about the means. Therefore the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, rather than the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, should be called principal or cardinal.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that which is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> so is principal in comparison with that which is so by participation. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> belong to that which is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> rational: whereas the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> belong to that which is rational by participation, as stated above (58, 3). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are principal, rather than the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> in explaining the words, "Blessed are the poor in spirit" (<a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse20">Luke 6:20</a>) says: "We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that there are four cardinal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, viz. <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>." But these are moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Therefore the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are cardinal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> When we speak of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> simply, we are understood to speak of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated above (Question 56, Article 3), is one that answers to the perfect <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which requires rectitude of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>: for such like <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> not only confers the faculty of doing well, but also <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> done. On the other hand, the name <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is applied to one that answers imperfectly to the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and does not require rectitude of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>: because it merely confers the faculty of doing well without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> to be done. Now it is evident that the perfect is principal as compared to the imperfect: and so those <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which imply rectitude of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> are called principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Such are the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> alone, of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, for it is also something of a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as was clearly shown above (Question 57, Article 4). Consequently, those <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which are called principal or cardinal are fittingly placed among the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> When a univocal genus is divided into its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, the members of the division are on a par in the point of the generic <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>; although considered in their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as things, one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> may surpass another in rank and perfection, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in respect of other animals. But when we divide an analogous term, which is applied to several things, but to one before it is applied to another, nothing hinders one from ranking before another, even in the point of the generic <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>; as the notion of being is applied to <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> principally in relation to <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>. Such is the division of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> into various kinds of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: since the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> defined by reason is not found in the same way in all things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are above <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as stated above (58, 3, ad 3). Hence they should properly be called not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, but "super-<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>" or <a href="../cathen/07292c.htm">godlike virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, except in <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, rank before the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, in the point of their subject, they do not rank before them as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; for a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as such, regards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is the object of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether there are four cardinal virtues?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there are not four cardinal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is the directing principle of the other moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as is clear from what has been said above (Question 58, Article 4). But that which directs other things ranks before them. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> alone is a principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are, in a way, moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Now we are directed to moral works both by the practical reason, and by a right <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, as stated in Ethic. vi, 2. Therefore there are only two cardinal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, even among the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> one ranks higher than another. But in order that a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> be principal, it needs not to rank above all the others, but above some. Therefore it seems that there are many more principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. ii): "The entire structure of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works is built on four <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Things may be numbered either in respect of their formal principles, or according to the subjects in which they are: and either way we find that there are four cardinal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p>For the formal principle of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of which we speak now is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as defined by reason; which <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is considered in two ways. First, as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the very <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>: and thus we have one principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, called "<a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">Prudence</a>." Secondly, according as the reason puts its order into something else; either into operations, and then we have "Justice"; or into <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, and then we need two <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For the need of putting the order of reason into the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> is due to their thwarting reason: and this occurs in two ways. First, by the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> inciting to something against reason, and then the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> need a curb, which we call "Temperance." Secondly, by the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> withdrawing us from following the dictate of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, e.g. through fear of danger or toil: and then <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs to be strengthened for that which reason dictates, lest he turn back; and to this end there is "Fortitude."

<p>In like manner, we find the same number if we consider the subjects of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For there are four subjects of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> we speak of now: viz. the power which is rational in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, and this is perfected by "<a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">Prudence</a>"; and that which is rational by participation, and is threefold, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, subject of "Justice," the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty, subject of "Temperance," and the irascible faculty, subject of "Fortitude."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">Prudence</a> is the principal of all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> simply. The others are principal, each in its own genus.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> That part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is rational by participation is threefold, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> All the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> among which one ranks before another, are reducible to the above four, both as to the subject and as to the formal principle.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether any other virtues should be called principal rather than these?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> should be called principal rather than these. For, seemingly, the greatest is the principal in any genus. Now "magnanimity has a great influence on all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>" (Ethic. iv, 3). Therefore magnanimity should more than any be called a principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which strengthens the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> should above all be called a principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But such is <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>: for <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. iv in Ev.) that "he who gathers the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> without <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is as one who carries straw against the wind." Therefore <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> seems above all to be a principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that which is most perfect seems to be principal. But this applies to patience, according to <a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse4">James 1:4</a>: "Patience hath a perfect work." Therefore patience should be reckoned a principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Cicero reduces all other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> to these four (De Invent. Rhet. ii).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), these four are reckoned as cardinal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, in respect of the four formal principles of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> as we understand it now. These principles are found chiefly in certain acts and <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Thus the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, is found chiefly in reason's command, but not in its counsel or its judgment, as stated above (Question 57, Article 6). Again, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as defined by reason and put into our operations as something right and due, is found chiefly in commutations and distributions in respect of another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and on a basis of equality. The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of curbing the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> is found chiefly in those <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> which are most difficult to curb, viz. in the pleasures of touch. The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of being firm in holding to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> defined by reason, against the impulse of passion, is found chiefly in perils of death, which are most difficult to withstand.

<p>Accordingly the above four <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> may be considered in two ways. First, in respect of their common formal principles. In this way they are called principal, being general, as it were, in comparison with all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: so that, for instance, any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in reason's act of consideration, may be called <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>; every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of right and due in operation, be called <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that curbs and represses the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, be called <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>; and every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that strengthens the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> against any <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> whatever, be called <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. Many, both <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>, as also <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, speak about these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in this sense: and in this way the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are contained under them. Wherefore all the objections fail.

<p>Secondly, they may be considered in point of their being denominated, each one from that which is foremost in its respective <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and thus they are specific <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, condivided with the others. Yet they are called principal in comparison with the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, on account of the importance of their <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: so that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which commands; <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which is about due actions between equals; <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which suppresses desires for the pleasures of touch; and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which strengthens against dangers of death. Thus again do the objections fail: because the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> may be principal in some other way, but these are called principal by reason of their <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as stated above.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the four cardinal virtues differ from one another?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the above four <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not diverse and distinct from one another. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxii, 1): "There is no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, unless it be <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, temperate and brave; no perfect <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, that is not brave, just and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>; no sound <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, that is not <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>, temperate and just; no real <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, without <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> and <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>." But this would not be so, if the above <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> were distinct from one another: since the different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of one genus do not qualify one another. Therefore the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not distinct from one another.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, among things distinct from one another the function of one is not attributed to another. But the function of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is attributed to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>: for <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Offic. xxxvi): "Rightly do we call it <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, when a man conquers himself, and is not weakened and bent by any enticement." And of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> he says (De Offic. xliii, xlv) that it "safeguards the manner and order in all things that we decide to do and say." Therefore it seems that these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not distinct from one another.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 4) that the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are first of all "that a man should have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; secondly, that he should exercise choice for a particular end; thirdly, that he should possess the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> and act with firmness and steadfastness." But the first of these seems to belong to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> which is rectitude of reason in things to be done; the second, i.e. choice, belongs to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, whereby a man, holding his <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> on the curb, acts, not from passion but from choice; the third, that a man should act for the sake of a due end, implies a certain rectitude, which seemingly belongs to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; while the last, viz. firmness and steadfastness, belongs to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. Therefore each of these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> is general in comparison to other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Therefore they are not distinct from one another.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Moribus Eccl. xi) that "there are four <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, corresponding to the various emotions of love," and he applies this to the four <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> mentioned above. Therefore the same four <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are distinct from one another.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), these four <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are understood differently by various writers. For some take them as signifying certain general <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind, to be found in all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: so that, to wit, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is merely a certain rectitude of discretion in any actions or matters whatever; <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, a certain rectitude of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, whereby a man does what he ought in any matters; <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, a disposition of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, moderating any <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> or operations, so as to keep them within bounds; and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, a disposition whereby the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is strengthened for that which is in accord with reason, against any assaults of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, or the toil involved by any operations. To distinguish these four <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in this way does not imply that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> are distinct <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>: because it is fitting that every moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, from the fact that it is a "<a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>," should be accompanied by a certain firmness so as not to be moved by its contrary: and this, we have said, belongs to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. Moreover, inasmuch as it is a "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>," it is directed to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which involves the notion of right and due; and this, we have said, belongs to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Again, owing to the fact that it is a "moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>" partaking of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, it observes the mode of reason in all things, and does not exceed its bounds, which has been stated to belong to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>. It is only in the point of having discretion, which we ascribed to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, that there seems to be a distinction from the other three, inasmuch as discretion belongs <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> to reason; whereas the other three imply a certain share of reason by way of a kind of application (of reason) to <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> or operations. According to the above explanation, then, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> would be distinct from the other three <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: but these would not be distinct from one another; for it is evident that one and the same <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is both <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p>Others, however, with better reason, take these four <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, according as they have their special determinate <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; each of its own <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, in which special commendation is given to that general <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> from which the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue's</a> name is taken as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). In this way it is clear that the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are distinct <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, differentiated in respect of their diverse objects.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> is speaking of these four <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in the first sense given above. It may also be said that these four <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> qualify one another by a kind of overflow. For the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> overflow on to the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in so far as they are directed by <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. And each of the others overflows on to the rest, for the reason that whoever can do what is harder, can do what is less difficult. Wherefore whoever can curb his desires for the pleasures of touch, so that they keep within bounds, which is a very hard thing to do, for this very reason is more able to check his daring in dangers of death, so as not to go too far, which is much easier; and in this sense <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is said to be temperate. Again, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is said to be brave, by reason of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> overflowing into <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>: in so far, to wit, as he whose mind is strengthened by <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> against dangers of death, which is a matter of very great difficulty, is more able to remain firm against the onslaught of pleasures; for as Cicero says (De Offic. i), "it would be inconsistent for a man to be unbroken by fear, and yet vanquished by cupidity; or that he should be conquered by <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, after showing himself to be unconquered by toil."

<p>From this the Reply to the Second Objection is clear. For <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> observes the mean in all things, and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> keeps the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> unbent by the enticements of pleasures, either in so far as these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are taken to denote certain general <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, or in the sense that they overflow on to one another, as explained above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> These four general <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> set down by the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a>, are not proper to the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. They may, however, be appropriated to them, in the way above stated.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the cardinal virtues are fittingly divided into social virtues, perfecting, perfect, and exemplar virtues?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that these four <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are unfittingly divided into exemplar <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, perfecting <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and social <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For as Macrobius says (Super Somn. Scip. 1), the "exemplar <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are such as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Now the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. x, 8) that "it is absurd to ascribe <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> cannot be exemplar.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the "perfect" <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are those which are without any passion: for Macrobius says (Super Somn. Scip. 1) that "in a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that is cleansed, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> has not to check worldly desires, for it has forgotten all about them: <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> nothing about the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>; it does not have to conquer them." Now it was stated above (Question 59, Article 5) that the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> cannot be without <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Therefore there is no such thing as "perfect" <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, he says (Macrobius: Super Somn. Scip. 1) that the "perfecting" <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are those of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> "who flies from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs and devotes himself exclusively to the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." But it seems wrong to do this, for Cicero says (De Offic. i): "I reckon that it is not only unworthy of praise, but <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> for a man to say that he despises what most men admire, viz. power and office." Therefore there are no "perfecting" <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, he says (Macrobius: Super Somn. Scip. 1) that the "social" <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are those "whereby <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> men work for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of their country and for the safety of the city." But it is only legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> that is directed to the common weal, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. v, 1). Therefore other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> should not be called "social."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Macrobius says (Super Somn. Scip. 1): "Plotinus, together with <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> foremost among teachers of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, says: 'The four kinds of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are fourfold: In the first place there are social <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; secondly, there are perfecting <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> <span class="stiki">Virtutes purgatoriae: literally meaning, cleansing <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a></span>; thirdly, there are perfect <span class="stiki">Virtutes purgati animi: literally, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of the clean <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a></span> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; and fourthly, there are exemplar <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.'" <span class="stiki">Cf. <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom's</a> fifteenth <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> on <a href="../bible/mat000.htm">St. Matthew</a>, where he says: "The gentle, the modest, the merciful, the just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not shut up his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> within himself . . . He that is clean of heart and peaceful, and suffers <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, lives for the common weal."</span>

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Moribus Eccl. vi), "the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> needs to follow something in order to give birth to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: this something is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: if we follow Him we shall live aright." Consequently the exemplar of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> must needs pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, just as in Him pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> the types of all things. Accordingly <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> may be considered as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> originally in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and thus we speak of "exemplar" <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: so that in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Divine Mind itself may be called <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>; while <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is the turning of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> gaze on Himself, even as in us it is that which conforms the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is His unchangeableness; His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is the observance of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">Eternal</a> Law in His works, as Plotinus states (Cf. Macrobius, Super Somn. Scip. 1).

<p>Again, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is a social [See above note on <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>] animal, these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, in so far as they are in him according to the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, are called "social" <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; since it is by reason of them that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> behaves himself well in the conduct of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs. It is in this sense that we have been speaking of these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> until now.

<p>But since it behooves a man to do his utmost to strive onward even to Divine things, as even the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> declares in Ethic. x, 7, and as <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> often admonishes us--for instance: "Be ye . . . perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect" (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse48">Matthew 5:48</a>), we must needs place some <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> between the social or <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and the exemplar <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which are Divine. Now these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> differ by reason of a difference of movement and term: so that some are <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who are on their way and tending towards the Divine similitude; and these are called "perfecting" <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Thus <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, by contemplating the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, counts as nothing all things of the world, and directs all the thoughts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone: <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, so far as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> allows, neglects the needs of the body; <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> prevents the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from being afraid of neglecting the body and rising to heavenly things; and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> consists in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> giving a whole-hearted consent to follow the way thus proposed. Besides these there are the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of those who have already attained to the Divine similitude: these are called the "perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>." Thus <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> sees nought else but the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> no earthly desires; <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> has no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of passion; and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, by imitating the Divine Mind, is united thereto by an everlasting covenant. Such as the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> attributed to the Blessed, or, in this life, to some who are at the summit of perfection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> is speaking of these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> according as they relate to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs; for instance, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, about buying and selling; <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, about fear; <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, about desires; for in this sense it is absurd to attribute them to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, that is to say, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> living together in this world, are about the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of those who have attained to perfect bliss are without <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Hence Plotinus says (Cf. Macrobius, Super Somn. Scip. 1) that "the social <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> check the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>," i.e. they bring them to the relative mean; "the second kind," viz. the perfecting <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, "uproot them"; "the third kind," viz. the perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, "forget them; while it is impious to mention them in connection with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of the fourth kind," viz. the exemplar <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. It may also be said that here he is speaking of <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> as denoting inordinate emotions.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> To neglect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs when <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> forbids is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>; otherwise it is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>. Hence Cicero says a little earlier: "Perhaps one should make allowances for those who by reason of their exceptional talents have devoted themselves to learning; as also to those who have retired from public life on account of failing health, or for some other yet weightier motive; when such men yielded to others the power and renown of authority." This agrees with what <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xix, 19): "The love of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> demands a hollowed leisure; <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> necessitates <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works. If no one lays this burden on us we may devote ourselves to the study and <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; but if the burden is laid on us it is to be taken up under the pressure of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> alone regards the common weal directly: but by commanding the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> it draws them all into the service of the common weal, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> declares (Ethic. v, 1). For we must take note that it concerns the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as we understand them here, to do well not only towards the community, but also towards the parts of the community, viz. towards the household, or even towards one <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>.
