<h1>Question 61. The necessity of the sacraments</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/4061.htm#article1"> Are sacraments necessary for man's salvation?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4061.htm#article2"> Were they necessary in the state that preceded sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4061.htm#article3"> Were they necessary in the state after sin and before Christ?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4061.htm#article4"> Were they necessary after Christ's coming?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether sacraments are necessary for man's salvation?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse8">1 Timothy 4:8</a>): "Bodily exercise is profitable to little." But the use of <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> pertains to bodily exercise; because <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are perfected in the signification of sensible things and words, as stated above (Question 60, Article 6). Therefore <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> was told (<a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse9">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>): "My <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is sufficient for thee." But it would not suffice if <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> were <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, given a sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, nothing more seems to be required for the effect. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> is the sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; for the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse10">Romans 5:10</a>): "If, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the death of His Son: much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved by His life." Therefore <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Faust. xix): "It is impossible to keep men together in one religious denomination, whether <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> or <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, except they be united by means of visible signs or <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>." But it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> that men be united together in the name of the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion. Therefore <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Sacraments are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> unto <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> for three reasons. The first is taken from the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which is such that it has to be led by things corporeal and sensible to things <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and intelligible. Now it belongs to <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a> to provide for each one according as its <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> requires. Divine wisdom, therefore, fittingly provides <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with means of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, in the shape of corporeal and sensible signs that are called <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p>The second reason is taken from the state of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> subjected himself by his affections to corporeal things. Now the healing remedy should be given to a man so as to reach the part affected by disease. Consequently it was fitting that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should provide <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> medicine by means of certain corporeal signs; for if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> were offered <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things without a veil, his mind being taken up with the material world would be unable to apply itself to them.

<p>The third reason is taken from the fact that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is prone to direct his activity chiefly towards material things. Lest, therefore, it should be too hard for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be drawn away entirely from bodily actions, bodily exercise was offered to him in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, by which he might be trained to avoid <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> practices, consisting in the worship of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and all manner of harmful action, consisting in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>.

<p>It follows, therefore, that through the institution of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, consistently with his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, is instructed through sensible things; he is <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a>, through confessing that he is subject to corporeal things, seeing that he receives assistance through them: and he is even preserved from bodily hurt, by the healthy exercise of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Bodily exercise, as such, is not very profitable: but exercise taken in the use of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> is not merely bodily, but to a certain extent <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, viz. in its signification and in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is a sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gives <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in a way which is suitable to him. Hence it is that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> that he may obtain <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> is a sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. But it does not follow that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are not also <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for that purpose: because they obtain their effect through the power of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>; and <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> is, so to say, applied to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> through the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse3">Romans 6:3</a>): "All we who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in His death."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether before sin sacraments were necessary to man?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> were <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For, as stated above (1, ad 2) <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> that he may obtain <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needed <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> even in the state of innocence, as we stated in I, 95, 4 (cf. I-II, 109, 2; I-II, 114, 2). Therefore <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> were <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in that state also.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are suitable to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by reason of the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is the same before and after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore it seems that before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needed the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, according to <a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse32">Ephesians 5:32</a>: "This is a great sacrament; but I speak in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>." But <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> was instituted before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as may be seen in <a href="../bible/gen002.htm">Genesis 2</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> were <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> None but the sick need remedies, according to <a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse12">Matthew 9:12</a>: "They that are in health need not a physician." Now the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> remedies for the healing of wounds inflicted by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore they were not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Sacraments were not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in the state of innocence. This can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> from the rectitude of that state, in which the higher (parts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>) ruled the lower, and nowise depended on them: for just as the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> was subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so were the lower powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> subject to the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and the body to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And it would be contrary to this order if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> were perfected either in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, by anything corporeal; which happens in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Therefore in the state of innocence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needed no <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, whether as remedies against <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> or as means of perfecting the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In the state of innocence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needed <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: not so that he needed to obtain <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> by means of sensible signs, but in a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and invisible manner.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is the same before and after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but the state of his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not the same. Because after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, even in its higher part, needs to receive something from corporeal things in order that it may be perfected: whereas <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had no need of this in that state.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Matrimony was instituted in the state of innocence, not as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but as a function of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Consequently, however, it foreshadowed something in relation to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: just as everything else foreshadowed <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether there should have been sacraments after sin, before Christ?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that there should have been no <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For it has been stated that the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion of Christ</a> is applied to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> through the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>: so that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> is compared to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> as <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to effect. But effect does not precede <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Therefore there should have been no <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> coming.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> should be suitable to the state of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> declares (Contra Faust. xix). But the state of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> underwent no change after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> until it was repaired by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Neither, therefore, should the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> have been changed, so that besides the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, others should be instituted in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the nearer a thing approaches to that which is perfect, the more like it should it be. Now the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> was accomplished by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; to Whom the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> were nearer than those that preceded the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. Therefore they should have borne a greater likeness to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And yet the contrary is the case, since it was foretold that the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> would be "according to the order of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a>, and not . . . according to the order of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>" (<a href="../bible/heb007.htm#verse11">Hebrews 7:11</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> were unsuitably instituted before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Faust. xix) that "the first <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> commanded to be solemnized and observed were announcements of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> future coming." But it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> coming should be announced beforehand. Therefore it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that some <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> should be instituted before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Sacraments are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, in so far as they are sensible signs of invisible things whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is made <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>. Now after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can be made <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> save through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, "Whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath proposed to be a propitiation, through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in His blood, to the showing of His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> . . . that He Himself may be <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, and the justifier of him who is of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse25">Romans 3:25-26</a>). Therefore before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> coming there was need for some visible signs whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> might testify to his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the future coming of a Saviour. And these signs are called <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. It is therefore clear that some <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> were <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> coming.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> is the final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the old <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>: for they were instituted in order to foreshadow it. Now the final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> precedes not in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, but in the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the agent. Consequently, there is no reason against the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> before <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The state of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> can be considered from two points of view. First, from that of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: and thus it was always one and the same: since men were made righteous, through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the future coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Secondly, according as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was more or less intense, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> more or less explicit. For as time went on <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> gained a greater hold on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, so much so that it clouded <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> reason, the consequence being that the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> were insufficient to make <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> live aright, and it became <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to have a written code of fixed laws, and together with these certain <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, as time went on, that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> should be more and more unfolded, since, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. vi in Ezech.): "With the advance of time there was an advance in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Divine things." Consequently in the old Law there was also a need for certain fixed <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> significative of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the future coming of Christ: which <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are compared to those that preceded the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, as something determinate to that which is indeterminate: inasmuch as before the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> it was not laid down precisely of what <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> men were to make use: whereas this was prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>; and this was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> both on account of the overclouding of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, and for the clearer signification of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The sacrament of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a> which preceded the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> is more like the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Sacrament of the New Law</a> in its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: in so far as "he offered bread and wine" (<a href="../bible/gen014.htm#verse18">Genesis 14:18</a>), just as bread and wine are offered in the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">sacrifice of the New Testament</a>. Nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic Law</a> are more like the thing signified by the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> of Christ: as clearly appears in the Paschal Lamb and such like. The reason of this was lest, if the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> retained the same appearance, it might seem to be the continuation of one and the same sacrament, where there was no interruption of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether there was need for any sacraments after Christ came?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that there was no need for any <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> after <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> came. For the figure should cease with the advent of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But "<a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> came by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>" (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse17">John 1:17</a>). Since, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are signs or figures of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, it seems that there was no need for any <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> after <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> consist in certain elements, as stated above (Question 60, Article 4). But the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse3">Galatians 4:3-4</a>) that "when we were children we were serving under the elements of the world": but that now "when the fulness of time" has "come," we are no longer children. Therefore it seems that we should not serve <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> under the elements of this world, by making use of corporeal <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse17">James 1:17</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "there is no change, nor shadow of alteration." But it seems to argue some change in the Divine will that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should give <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> certain <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> for his sanctification now during the time of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> coming. Therefore it seems that other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> should not have been instituted after <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Faust. xix) that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> "were abolished because they were fulfilled; and others were instituted, fewer in number, but more efficacious, more profitable, and of easier accomplishment."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As the ancient Fathers were saved through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> future coming, so are we saved through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> past birth and <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are signs in protestation of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is justified; and signs should vary according as they signify the future, the past, or the present; for as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Faust. xix), "the same thing is variously pronounced as to be done and as having been done: for instance the word 'passurus' [going to suffer] differs from 'passus' [having suffered]." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, that signify <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in relation to the past, must needs differ from those of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, that foreshadowed the future.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. v), the state of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>. is between the state of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, whose figures are fulfilled in the New, and the state of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, in which all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> will be openly and perfectly revealed. Wherefore then there will be no <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. But now, so long as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> "through a glass in a dark manner," (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>) we need sensible signs in order to reach <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things: and this is the province of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> calls the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> "weak and needy elements" (<a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse9">Galatians 4:9</a>) because they neither contained nor <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says that those who used these <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> served <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "under the elements of this world": for the very reason that these <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> were nothing else than the elements of this world. But our <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> both contain and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: consequently the comparison does not hold.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Just as the head of the house is not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to have a changeable mind, through issuing various commands to his household at various seasons, ordering things differently in winter and summer; so it does not follow that there is any change in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because He instituted <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of one kind after <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> coming, and of another kind at the time of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. because the latter were suitable as foreshadowing <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; the former as signifying the presence of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>,
