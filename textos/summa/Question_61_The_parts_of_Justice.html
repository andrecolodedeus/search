<h1>Question 61. The parts of Justice</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3061.htm#article1"> Are there two species of justice, viz. distributive and commutative?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3061.htm#article2"> In either case, is the mean taken in the same way?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3061.htm#article3"> Is their matter uniform or manifold?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3061.htm#article4"> In any of these species, is the just the same as counter-passion?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether two species of justice are suitably assigned, viz. commutative and distributive?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the two <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> are unsuitably assigned, viz. distributive and commutative. That which is hurtful to the many cannot be a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, since <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is directed to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now it is hurtful to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the many, if the goods of the community are distributed among many, both because the goods of the community would be exhausted, and because the morals of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> would be corrupted. For Tully says (De Offic. ii, 15): "He who receives becomes worse, and the more ready to expect that he will receive again." Therefore distribution does not belong to any <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is to render to each one what is his own, as stated above (Question 58, Article 2). But when things are distributed, a man does not receive what was his, but becomes possessed of something which belonged to the community. Therefore this does not pertain to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is not only in the sovereign, but also in the subject, as stated above (Question 58, Article 6). But it belongs exclusively to the sovereign to distribute. Therefore distribution does not always belong to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, "Distributive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> regards common goods" (Ethic. v, 4). Now matters regarding the community pertain to legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Therefore distributive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is a part, not of particular, but of legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, unity or multitude do not change the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now commutative <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> consists in rendering something to one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, while distributive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> consists in giving something to many. Therefore they are not different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> assigns two parts to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and says (Ethic. v, 2) that "one directs distributions, the other, commutations."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (58, 7,8), particular <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is directed to the private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, who is compared to the community as a part to the whole. Now a twofold order may be considered in relation to a part. On the first place there is the order of one part to another, to which corresponds the order of one private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> to another. This order is directed by commutative <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which is concerned about the mutual dealings between two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. On the second place there is the order of the whole towards the parts, to which corresponds the order of that which belongs to the community in relation to each single <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. This order is directed by distributive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which distributes common goods proportionately. Hence there are two <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, distributive and commutative.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Just as a private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> is praised for moderation in his bounty, and blamed for excess therein, so too ought moderation to be observed in the distribution of common goods, wherein distributive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> directs.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Even as part and whole are somewhat the same, so too that which pertains to the whole, pertains somewhat to the part also: so that when the goods of the community are distributed among a number of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> each one receives that which, in a way, is his own.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The act of distributing the goods of the community, belongs to none but those who exercise authority over those goods; and yet distributive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is also in the subjects to whom those goods are distributed in so far as they are contented by a just distribution. Moreover distribution of common goods is sometimes made not to the state but to the members of a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and such distribution can be made by authority of a private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Movement takes its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the term "whereunto." Hence it belongs to legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to direct to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> those matters which concern private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>: whereas on the contrary it belongs to particular <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to direct the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to particular <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> by way of distribution.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Distributive and commutative <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> differ not only in respect of unity and multitude, but also in respect of different kinds of due: because common property is due to an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> in one way, and his personal property in another way.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the mean is to be observed in the same way in distributive as in commutative justice?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the mean in distributive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is to be observed in the same way as in commutative <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. For each of these is a kind of particular <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Now the mean is taken in the same way in all the parts of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> or <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. Therefore the mean should also be observed in the same way in both distributive and commutative <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the form of a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> consists in observing the mean which is determined in accordance with reason. Since, then, one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> has one form, it seems that the mean for both should be the same.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in order to observe the mean in distributive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> we have to consider the various deserts of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Now a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> deserts are considered also in commutative <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, for instance, in punishments; thus a man who strikes a prince is punished more than one who strikes a private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. Therefore the mean is observed in the same way in both kinds of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. v, 3,4) that the mean in distributive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is observed according to "geometrical proportion," whereas in commutative <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> it follows "arithmetical proportion."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), in distributive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> something is given to a private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, in so far as what belongs to the whole is due to the part, and in a <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> that is proportionate to the importance of the position of that part in respect of the whole. Consequently in distributive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> receives all the more of the common goods, according as he holds a more prominent position in the community. This prominence in an aristocratic community is gauged according to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, in an oligarchy according to <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, in a democracy according to liberty, and in various ways according to various forms of community. Hence in distributive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> the mean is observed, not according to equality between thing and thing, but according to proportion between things and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>: in such a way that even as one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> surpasses another, so that which is given to one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> surpasses that which is allotted to another. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. v, 3,4) that the mean in the latter case follows "geometrical proportion," wherein equality depends not on <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> but on proportion. For example we say that 6 is to 4 as 3 is to 2, because in either case the proportion equals 1-1/2; since the greater number is the sum of the lesser plus its half: whereas the equality of excess is not one of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, because 6 exceeds 4 by 2, while 3 exceeds 2 by 1.

<p>On the other hand in commutations something is paid to an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> on account of something of his that has been received, as may be seen chiefly in selling and buying, where the notion of commutation is found primarily. Hence it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to equalize thing with thing, so that the one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> should pay back to the other just so much as he has become richer out of that which belonged to the other. The result of this will be equality according to the "arithmetical mean" which is gauged according to equal excess in <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. Thus 5 is the mean between 6 and 4, since it exceeds the latter and is exceeded by the former, by 1. Accordingly if, at the start, both <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> have 5, and one of them receives 1 out of the other's belongings, the one that is the receiver, will have 6, and the other will be left with 4: and so there will be <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> if both be brought back to the mean, 1 being taken from him that has 6, and given to him that has 4, for then both will have 5 which is the mean.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In the other moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> the rational, not the real mean, is to be followed: but <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> follows the real mean; wherefore the mean, in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, depends on the diversity of things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Equality is the general form of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, wherein distributive and commutative <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> agree: but in one we find equality of geometrical proportion, whereas in the other we find equality of arithmetical proportion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In actions and <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> station affects the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of a thing: for it is a greater injury to strike a prince than a private <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Hence in distributive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> station is considered in itself, whereas in commutative <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> it is considered in so far as it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a diversity of things.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether there is a different matter for both kinds of justice?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is not a different <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> for both kinds of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Diversity of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> diversity of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as in the case of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> and <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>. Therefore, if distributive and commutative <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> have different matters, it would seem that they are not comprised under the same <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, viz. <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the distribution that has to do with distributive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is one of "<a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> or of honors, or of whatever can be distributed among the members of the community" (Ethic. v, 2), which very things are the subject <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of commutations between one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and another, and this belongs to commutative <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Therefore the matters of distributive and commutative <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> are not distinct.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of distributive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> differs from that of commutative <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, for the reason that they differ specifically, where there is no specific difference, there ought to be no diversity of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. v, 2) reckons commutative <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> as one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and yet this has many kinds of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of these <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is, seemingly, not of many kinds.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is stated in Ethic. v, 2 that "one kind of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> directs distributions, and another commutations."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (51, 8,10), <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is about certain external operations, namely distribution and commutation. These consist in the use of certain externals, whether things, <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> or even works: of things, as when one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> takes from or restores to another that which is his; of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, as when a man does an injury to the very <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of another, for instance by striking or insulting him, or even by showing respect for him; and of works, as when a man <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> exacts a work of another, or does a work for him. Accordingly, if we take for the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of each kind of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> the things themselves of which the operations are the use, the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of distributive and commutative <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is the same, since things can be distributed out of the common property to <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, and be the subject of commutation between one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and another; and again there is a certain distribution and payment of laborious works.

<p>If, however, we take for the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of both kinds of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> the principal actions themselves, whereby we make use of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, things, and works, there is then a difference of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> between them. For distributive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> directs distributions, while commutative <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> directs commutations that can take place between two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. of these some are involuntary, some <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. They are involuntary when anyone uses another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> chattel, <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, or work against his will, and this may be done secretly by <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a>, or openly by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. On either case the offence may be committed against the other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> chattel or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, or against a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> connected with him. If the offence is against his chattel and this be taken secretly, it is called "<a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>," if openly, it is called "robbery." If it be against another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, it may affect either the very <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of his <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, or his dignity. If it be against the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of his <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, a man is injured secretly if he is treacherously slain, struck or poisoned, and openly, if he is publicly slain, imprisoned, struck or maimed. If it be against his personal dignity, a man is injured secretly by <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> witness, detractions and so forth, whereby he is deprived of his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">good name</a>, and openly, by being accused in a court of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, or by public insult. If it be against a personal connection, a man is injured in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of his wife, secretly (for the most part) by <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of his <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a>, if the latter be induced to leave his master: which things can also be done openly. The same applies to other personal connections, and whatever injury may be committed against the principal, may be committed against them also. Adultery, however, and inducing a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> to leave his master are properly injuries against the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; yet the latter, since a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> is his master's chattel, is referred to <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>. Voluntary commutations are when a man <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> transfers his chattel to another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. And if he transfer it simply so that the recipient incurs no debt, as in the case of <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, it is an act, not of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> but of liberality. A <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> transfer belongs to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> in so far as it includes the notion of debt, and this may occur in many ways. First when one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> simply transfers his thing to another in exchange for another thing, as happens in selling and buying. Secondly when a man transfers his thing to another, that the latter may have the use of it with the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of returning it to its owner. If he grant the use of a thing gratuitously, it is called "usufruct" in things that bear fruit; and simply "borrowing" on "loan" in things that bear no fruit, such as money, pottery, etc.; but if not even the use is granted gratis, it is called "letting" or "hiring." Thirdly, a man transfers his thing with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of recovering it, not for the purpose of its use, but that it may be kept safe, as in a "deposit," or under some <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, as when a man pledges his property, or when one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> stands security for another. On all these actions, whether <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> or involuntary, the mean is taken in the same way according to the equality of repayment. Hence all these actions belong to the one same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, namely commutative <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. And this suffices for the Replies to the Objections.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the just is absolutely the same as retaliation?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the just is absolutely the same as retaliation. For the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is absolutely just. Now the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is such that a man has to suffer in proportion with his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse2">Matthew 7:2</a>: "With what measure you judge, you shall be judged: and with what measure you mete, it shall be measured to you again." Therefore the just is absolutely the same as retaliation.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in either kind of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> something is given to someone according to a kind of equality. On distributive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> this equality regards personal dignity, which would seem to depend chiefly on what a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> has done for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the community; while in commutative <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> it regards the thing in which a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> has suffered loss. Now in respect of either equality there is retaliation in respect of the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> committed. Therefore it would seem that the just is absolutely the same as retaliation.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the chief argument against retaliation is based on the difference between the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> and the involuntary; for he who does an injury involuntarily is less severely punished. Now <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> and involuntary taken in relation to ourselves, do not diversify the mean of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> since this is the real mean and does not depend on us. Therefore it would seem that the just is absolutely the same as retaliation.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proves (Ethic. v, 5) that the just is not always the same as retaliation.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Retaliation [contrapassum] denotes equal passion repaid for previous action; and the expression applies most properly to injurious <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and actions, whereby a man harms the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of his neighbor; for instance if a man strike, that he be struck back. This kind of just is laid down in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> (<a href="../bible/exo021.htm#verse23">Exodus 21:23-24</a>): "He shall render life for life, eye for eye," etc. And since also to take away what belongs to another is to do an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> thing, it follows that secondly retaliation consists in this also, that whosoever <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> loss to another, should suffer loss in his belongings. This just loss is also found in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> (<a href="../bible/exo022.htm#verse1">Exodus 22:1</a>): "If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> steal an ox or a sheep, and kill or sell it, he shall restore five oxen for one ox and four sheep for one sheep." Thirdly retaliation is transferred to <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> commutations, where action and passion are on both sides, although voluntariness detracts from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of passion, as stated above (Question 59, Article 3).

<p>In all these cases, however, repayment must be made on a basis of equality according to the requirements of commutative <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, namely that the meed of passion be equal to the action. Now there would not always be equality if passion were in the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> as the action. Because, in the first place, when a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> injures the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of one who is greater, the action surpasses any passion of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> that he might undergo, wherefore he that strikes a prince, is not only struck back, but is much more severely punished. On like manner when a man despoils another of his property against the latter's will, the action surpasses the passion if he be merely deprived of that thing, because the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> another's loss, himself would lose nothing, and so he is punished by making restitution several times over, because not only did he injure a private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, but also the common weal, the security of whose protection he has infringed. Nor again would there be equality of passion in <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> commutations, were one always to exchange one's chattel for another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a>, because it might happen that the other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> chattel is much greater than our own: so that it becomes <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to equalize passion and action in commutations according to a certain proportionate commensuration, for which purpose money was invented. Hence retaliation is in accordance with commutative <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: but there is no place for it in distributive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, because in distributive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> we do not consider the equality between thing and thing or between passion and action (whence the expression 'contrapassum'), but according to proportion between things and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This form of the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">Divine judgment</a> is in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of commutative <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, in so far as rewards are apportioned to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, and punishments to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When a man who has served the community is paid for his services, this is to be referred to commutative, not distributive, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Because distributive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> considers the equality, not between the thing received and the thing done, but between the thing received by one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and the thing received by another according to the respective <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> When the injurious action is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, the injury is aggravated and consequently is considered as a greater thing. Hence it requires a greater punishment in repayment, by reason of a difference, not on part, but on the part of the thing.
