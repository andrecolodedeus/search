<h1>Question 61. The production of the angels in the order of natural being</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1061.htm#article1"> Does the angel have a cause of his existence?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1061.htm#article2"> Has he existed from eternity?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1061.htm#article3"> Was he created before corporeal creatures?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1061.htm#article4"> Were the angels created in the empyrean heaven?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the angels have a cause of their existence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. For the first chapter of Genesis treats of things <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But there is no mention of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were not <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. viii, text. 16) that if any <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> be a form without <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, "straightway it has being and unity of itself, and has no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of its being and unity." But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are immaterial forms, as was shown above (Question 50, Article 2). Therefore they have no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of their being.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whatever is produced by any agent, from the very fact of its being produced, receives form from it. But since the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are forms, they do not derive their form from any agent. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have no active <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/psa148.htm#verse2">Psalm 148:2</a>): "Praise ye Him, all His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>"; and further on, <a href="../bible/psa148.htm#verse5">verse 5</a>: "For He spoke and they were made."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It must be affirmed that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and everything <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a>, except <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, were made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is His own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; while in everything else the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> differs from the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, as was shown above (Question 3, Article 4). From this it is clear that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> of His own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>: while all other things have their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> by participation. Now whatever <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> by participation is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by what <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>; as everything ignited is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by fire. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, were made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xi, 50) that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were not passed over in that account of the first creation of things, but are designated by the name "heavens" or of "light." And they were either passed over, or else designated by the names of corporeal things, because <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was addressing an uncultured people, as yet incapable of understanding an incorporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and if it had been divulged that there were creatures <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> beyond corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it would have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to them an occasion of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, to which they were inclined, and from which <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> especially meant to safeguard them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">Substances</a> that are subsisting forms have no 'formal' <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> and unity, nor such active <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> as produces its effect by changing the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> from a state of <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a>; but they have a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> productive of their entire <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>.

<p>From this the solution of the third difficulty is manifest.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the angel was produced by God from eternity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> was produced by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> by His being: for He does not act through something besides His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. But His being is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. Therefore He produced the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, everything which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> at one period and not at another, is subject to time. But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is above time, as is laid down in the book De Causis. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is not at one time <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> and at another non-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a>, but <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> always.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. xiii) proves the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> incorruptibility by the fact that the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is capable of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is incorruptible, so is it <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is not only incorruptible, but likewise <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse22">Proverbs 8:22</a>), in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of begotten Wisdom: "The Lord possessed me in the beginning of His ways, before He made anything from the beginning." But, as was shown above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore at one time the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were not.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, Father, Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, is from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> holds this without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>; and everything to the contrary must be rejected as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> so produced creatures that He made them "from nothing"; that is, after they had not been.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> being is His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. So the fact that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> produced the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and other creatures by His being does not exclude that He made them also by His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. But, as was shown above (19, 3; 46, 1). <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will does not act by <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> in producing creatures. Therefore He produced such as He willed, and when He willed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> An <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is above that time which is the measure of the movement of the heavens; because he is above every movement of a corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Nevertheless he is not above time which is the measure of the succession of his <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> after his non-existence, and which is also the measure of the succession which is in his operations. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. viii, 20,21) that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> moves the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> creature according to time."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Angels and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are incorruptible by the very fact of their having a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> whereby they are capable of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But they did not possess this <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>; it was bestowed upon them when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself willed it. Consequently it does not follow that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the angels were created before the corporeal world?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> before the corporeal world. For <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (In Ep. ad Tit. i, 2): "Six thousand years of our time have not yet elapsed; yet how shall we measure the time, how shall we count the ages, in which the Angels, Thrones, Dominations, and the other orders served <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>?" <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> also says (De Fide Orth. ii): "Some say that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were begotten before all creation; as <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory the Theologian</a> declares, He first of all devised the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> and heavenly powers, and the devising was the making thereof."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> stands midway between the Divine and the corporeal natures. But the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>; while corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is from <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was produced ere <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> was made, and after <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is more remote from the corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> than one corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is from another. But one corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was made before another; hence the six days of the production of things are set forth in the <a href="../bible/gen001.htm">opening of Genesis</a>. Much more, therefore, was the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> made before every corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse1">Genesis 1:1</a>): "In the beginning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth." Now, this would not be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> if anything had been <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> previously. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were not <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> before corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There is a twofold opinion on this point to be found in the writings of the Fathers. The more probable one holds that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> at the same time as corporeal creatures. For the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are part of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>: they do not constitute a <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> of themselves; but both they and corporeal natures unite in constituting one <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. This stands in evidence from the relationship of creature to creature; because the mutual relationship of creatures makes up the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. But no part is perfect if separate from the whole. Consequently it is improbable that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Whose "works are perfect," as it is said <a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse4">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>, should have <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> creature before other creatures. At the same time the contrary is not to be deemed <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>; especially on account of the opinion of <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory Nazianzen</a>, "whose authority in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> doctrine is of such weight that no one has ever raised objection to his teaching, as is also the case with the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>," as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> is speaking according to the teaching of the Greek Fathers; all of whom hold the creation of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to have taken place previously to that of the corporeal world.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not a part of, but far above, the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, possessing within Himself the entire perfection of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> in a more eminent way. But an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is a part of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. Hence the comparison does not hold.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> All corporeal creatures are one in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; while the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not agree with them in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Consequently the creation of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the corporeal creature involves in a manner the creation of all things; but the creation of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> does not involve creation of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>.

<p>If the contrary view be held, then in the text of <a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse1">Genesis 1</a>, "In the beginning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth," the words, "In the beginning," must be interpreted, "In the Son," or "In the beginning of time": but not, "In the beginning, before which there was nothing," unless we say "Before which there was nothing of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of corporeal creatures."

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the angels were created in the empyrean heaven?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were not <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in the empyrean <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">incorporeal substances</a>. Now a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> which is incorporeal is not dependent upon a body for its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; and as a consequence, neither is it for its creation. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were not <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in any corporeal place.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> remarks (Gen. ad lit. iii, 10), that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in the upper atmosphere: therefore not in the empyrean <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the empyrean <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is said to be the highest <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. If therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in the empyrean <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, it would not beseem them to mount up to a still higher <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. And this is contrary to what is said in Isaias, speaking in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>: "I will ascend into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>" (<a href="../bible/isa014.htm#verse13">Isaiah 14:13</a>).

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Strabus, commenting on the text "In the beginning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth," says: "By <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> he does not mean the visible <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a>, but the empyrean, that is, the fiery or <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a>, which is not so styled from its heat, but from its splendor; and which was filled with <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> directly it was made."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was observed (3), the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is made up of corporeal and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> creatures. Consequently <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> creatures were so <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> as to bear some relationship to the corporeal creature, and to rule over every corporeal creature. Hence it was fitting for the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to be <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in the highest corporeal place, as presiding over all corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; whether it be styled the empyrean <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, or whatever else it be called. So <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says that the highest <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, explaining the passage of <a href="../bible/deu010.htm#verse14">Deuteronomy 10:14</a>: "Behold <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord's thy God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in a corporeal place, not as if depending upon a body either as to their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> or as to their being <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">made</a>; because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> could have <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> them before all corporeal creation, as many <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">Doctors</a> hold. They were made in a corporeal place in order to show their relationship to corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and that they are by their power in touch with bodies.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> By the uppermost atmosphere <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> possibly means the highest part of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, to which the atmosphere has a kind of affinity owing to its subtlety and transparency. Or else he is not speaking of all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; but only of such as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, who, in the opinion of some, belonged to the inferior orders. But there is nothing to hinder us from saying that the higher <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as having an exalted and universal power over all corporeal things, were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in the highest place of the corporeal creature; while the other <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as having more restricted powers, were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> among the inferior bodies.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Isaias is not speaking there of any corporeal heaven, but of the heaven of the Blessed Trinity; unto which the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">sinning angel</a> wished to ascend, when he desired to be equal in some manner to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as will appear later on (63, 3).
