<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether it is lawful for a husband to put away his wife on account of fornication?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem unlawful for a husband to put away his wife on account of fornication. For we must not return <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But the husband, by putting away his wife on account of fornication, seemingly returns <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore this is not lawful.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is greater if both commit fornication, than if one only commits it. But if both commit fornication, they cannot be <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a> on that account. Neither therefore can they be, if only one commits fornication.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> fornication and certain other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are more grievous than carnal fornication. But separation from bed cannot be motived by those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Neither therefore can it be done on account of fornication.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the unnatural <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is further removed from the marriage goods than fornication is, the manner of which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>. Therefore it ought to have been a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of separation rather than fornication.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> are the words of <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse32">Matthew 5:32</a>.

<p>Further, one is not bound to keep <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with one who breaks his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But a spouse by fornication breaks the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> due to the other spouse. Therefore one can put the other away on account of fornication.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> permitted a man to put away his wife on account of fornication, in punishment of the unfaithful party and in favor of the faithful party, so that the latter is not bound to marital intercourse with the unfaithful one. There are however seven cases to be excepted in which it is not lawful to put away a wife who has committed fornication, when either the wife is not to be blamed, or both parties are equally blameworthy. The first is if the husband also has committed fornication; the second is if he has prostituted his wife; the third is if the wife, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> her husband dead on account of his long absence, has <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> again; the fourth is if another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraudulently</a> impersonated her husband in the marriage-bed; the fifth is if she be overcome by force; the sixth is if he has been reconciled to her by having carnal intercourse with her after she has committed <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>; the seventh is if both having been <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> in the state of unbelief, the husband has given his wife a bill of <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> and she has <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> again; for then if both be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> the husband is bound to receive her back again.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A husband <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> if through vindictive <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> he puts away his wife who has committed fornication, but he does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> if he does so in order to avoid losing his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">good name</a>, lest he seem to share in her guilt, or in order to correct his wife's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or in order to avoid the uncertainty of her offspring.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Divorce on account of fornication is effected by the one accusing the other. And since no one can accuse who is guilty of the same crime, a <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> cannot be pronounced when both have committed fornication, although marriage is more <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against when both are guilty of fornication that when only one is.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Fornication is directly opposed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of marriage, since by it the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of offspring is destroyed, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is broken, and marriage ceases to have its signification when the body of one spouse is given to several others. Wherefore other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, though perhaps they be more grievous than fornication, are not motives for a <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a>. Since, however, unbelief which is called <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> fornication, is also opposed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of marriage consisting in the rearing of the offspring to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is also a motive for <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a>, yet not in the same way as bodily fornication. Because one may take steps for procuring a <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> on account of one act of carnal fornication, not, however, on account of one act of unbelief, but on account of inveterate unbelief which is a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of obstinacy wherein unbelief is perfected.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Steps may be taken to procure a <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> on account also of the unnatural <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>: but this is not mentioned in the same way, both because it is an unmentionable passion, and because it does not so affect the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of offspring.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the husband is bound by precept to put away his wife when she is guilty of fornication?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the husband is bound by precept to put away his wife who is guilty of fornication. For since the husband is the head of his wife, he is bound to correct his wife. Now separation from bed is prescribed as a correction of the wife who is guilty of fornication. Therefore he is bound to separate from her.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, he who consents with one who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally, is also guilty of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now the husband who retains a wife guilty of fornication would seem to consent with her, as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 35). Therefore he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> unless he puts her away.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse16">1 Corinthians 6:16</a>): "He who is joined to a harlot is made one body." Now a man cannot at once be a member of a harlot and a member of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse15">1 Corinthians 6:15</a>). Therefore the husband who is joined to a wife guilty of fornication ceases to be a member of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, just as relationship voids the marriage tie, so does fornication dissolve the marriage-bed. Now after the husband becomes cognizant of his <a href="../cathen/04264a.htm">consanguinity</a> with his wife, he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally if he has carnal intercourse with her. Therefore he also <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally if he does so after <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> her to be guilty of fornication.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong><em>On the contrary,</em> A <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse11">1 Corinthians 7:11</a>, "Let not the husband put away his wife" says that "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> permitted a wife to be <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">put away</a> on account of fornication." Therefore it is not a matter of precept.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, one can always pardon the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that another has committed against oneself. Now the wife, by committing fornication, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against her husband. Therefore the husband may spare her by not putting her away.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The putting away of a wife guilty of fornication was prescribed in order that the wife might be corrected by means of that punishment. Now a corrective punishment is not required when amendment has already taken place. Wherefore, if the wife repent of her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, her husband is not bound to put her away: whereas if she repent not, he is bound to do so, lest he seem to consent to her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, by not having recourse to her due correction.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The wife can be corrected for her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of fornication not only by this punishment but also by words and blows; wherefore if she be ready to be corrected otherwise, her husband is not bound to have recourse to the aforesaid punishment in order to correct her.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The husband seems to consent with her when he retains her, notwithstanding that she persists in her past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: if, however, she has mended her ways, he does not consent with her.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> She can no longer be called a harlot since she has repented of her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Wherefore her husband, by being joined to her, does not become a member of a harlot. We might also reply that he is joined to her not as a harlot but as his wife.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> There is no parallel, because the effect of <a href="../cathen/04264a.htm">consanguinity</a> is that there is no marriage tie between them, so that carnal intercourse between them becomes unlawful. Whereas fornication does not remove the said tie, so that the act remains, in itself, lawful, unless it become <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> unlawful, in so far as the husband seems to consent to his wife's lewdness.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> This permission is to be understood as an absence of prohibition: and thus it is not in contradistinction with a precept, for that which is a matter of precept is also not forbidden.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> The wife <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not only against her husband, but also against herself and against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, wherefore her husband cannot entirely remit the punishment, unless amendment has followed.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the husband can on his own judgment put away his wife on account of fornication?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the husband can on his own judgment <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">put away</a> his wife on account of fornication. For when sentence has been pronounced by the judge, it is lawful to carry it out without any further judgment. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the just Judge, has pronounced this judgment, that a husband may put his wife away on account of fornication. Therefore no further judgment is required for this.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is stated (<a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse19">Matthew 1:19</a>) that <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> . . . being a just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> . . . "was minded to put" Mary "away privately." Therefore it would seem that a husband may privately pronounce a <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> without the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if after becoming cognizant of his wife's fornication a husband has marital intercourse with his wife, he forfeits the action which he had against the adulteress. Therefore the refusal of the marriage debt, which pertains to a <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a>, ought to precede the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, that which cannot be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> ought not to be submitted to the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Now the crime of fornication cannot be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, since "the eye of the adulterer observeth darkness" (<a href="../bible/job024.htm#verse15">Job 24:15</a>). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> in question ought not to be made on the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, accusation should be preceded by inscription [Cf. II-II, 33, 7], whereby a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> binds himself under the pain of retaliation, if he fails to bring <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>. But this is impossible in this matter, because then, in every event the husband would obtain his end, whether he put his wife away, or his wife put him away. Therefore she ought not to be summoned by accusation to receive the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, a man is more bound to his wife than to a stranger. Now a man ought not to refer to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the crime of another, even though he be a stranger, without previously admonishing him privately (<a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse15">Matthew 18:15</a>). Much less therefore may the husband bring his wife's crime before the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, unless he has previously rebuked her in private.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> No one should avenge himself. But if a husband were by his own judgment to put away his wife on account of fornication, he would avenge himself. Therefore this should not be done.

<p>Further, no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is prosecutor and judge in the same <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But the husband is the prosecutor by suing his wife for the offense she has committed against him. Therefore he cannot be the judge, and consequently he cannot put her away on his own judgment.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A husband can <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">put away</a> his wife in two ways. First as to bed only, and thus he may put her away on his own judgment, as soon as he has evidence of her fornication: nor is he bound to pay her the marriage debt at her demand, unless he be compelled by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and by paying it thus he nowise prejudices his own case. Secondly, as to bed and board, and in this way she cannot be put away except at the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and if she has been put away otherwise, he must be compelled to cohabit with her unless the husband can at once <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the wife's fornication. Now this putting away is called a <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a>: and consequently it must be admitted that a <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> cannot be pronounced except at the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The sentence is an application of the general <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to a particular fact. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave out the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> according to which the sentence of the court has to be pronounced.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> was minded to put away the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> not as suspected of fornication, but because in reverence for her sanctity, he feared to cohabit with her. Moreover there is no parallel, because then the sentence at <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was not only <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> but also stoning, but not now when the case is brought to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for judgment. The Reply to the Third Objection is clear from what has been said.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Sometimes when the husband suspects his wife of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> he watches her secretly that together with <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> he may discover her in the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of fornication, and so proceed to accusation. Moreover, if he has no evidence of the fact, there may be strong suspicions of fornication, which suspicions being <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the fornication seems to be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>: for instance if they be found together alone, at a time and place which are open to suspicion, or "nudas cum nuda."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> A husband may accuse his wife of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> in two ways. First, he may seek a separation from bed before a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> judge, and then there is no need for an inscription to be made under the pain of retaliation, since thus the husband would gain his end, as the objection proves. Secondly, he may seek for the crime to be punished in a secular court, and then it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for inscription to precede, whereby he binds himself under pain of retaliation if he fail to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> his case.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> According to a <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a> (Extra, De Simonia, cap. Licet), "there are three modes of procedure in criminal cases. First, by inquisition, which should be preceded by <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notoriety</a>; secondly, by accusation, which should be preceded by inscription; [Cf. II-II, 33, 7] thirdly, by <a href="../cathen/04733b.htm">denunciation</a>, which should be preceded by <a href="../cathen/04394a.htm">fraternal correction</a>." Accordingly the saying of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> refers to the case where the process is by way of <a href="../cathen/04733b.htm">denunciation</a>, and not by accusation, because then the end in view is not only the correction of the guilty party, but also his punishment, for the safeguarding of the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which would be destroyed if <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> were lacking.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether in a case of divorce husband and wife should be judged on a par with each other?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that, in a case of <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a>, husband and wife ought not to be judged on a par with each other. For <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> under the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> takes the place of the <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> [repudium] recognized by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse31">Matthew 5:31-32</a>). Now in the "repudium" husband and wife were not judged on a par with each other, since the husband could <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">put away</a> his wife, but not "vice versa." Therefore neither in <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> ought they to be judged on a par with each other.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is more opposed to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> that a wife have several husbands than that a husband have several wives: wherefore the latter has been sometimes lawful, but the former never. Therefore the wife <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> more grievously in <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> than the husband, and consequently they ought not to be judged on a par with each other.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, where there is greater injury to one's neighbor, there is a greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulterous</a> wife does a greater injury to her husband, than does the <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulterous</a> husband to his wife, since a wife's <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> involves uncertainty of the offspring, whereas the husband's <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> does not. Therefore the wife's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the greater, and so they ought not to be judged on a par with each other.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> is prescribed in order to punish the crime of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. Now it belongs to the husband who is the head of the wife (<a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse3">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>) to <a href="../cathen/04394a.htm">correct</a> his wife, rather than "vice versa." Therefore they should not be judged on a par with each other for the purpose of <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a>, but the husband ought to have the preference.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It would seem in this matter the wife ought to have the preference. For the more frail the sinner the more is his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> deserving of pardon. Now there is greater frailty in <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> than in men, for which reason <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> [Hom. xl in the Opus Imperfectum <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>] says that "<a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> proper to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>," and the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 7) that "properly speaking <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are not said to be continent on account of their being easily inclined to <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>," for neither can dumb animals be continent, because they have nothing to stand in the way of their desires. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are rather to be spared in the punishment of <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, the husband is placed as the head of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in order to <a href="../cathen/04394a.htm">correct</a> her. Therefore his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is greater than the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> and so he should be punished the more.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In a case of <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> husband and wife are judged on a par with each other, in the sense that the same things are lawful or unlawful to the one as to the other: but they are not judged on a par with each other in reference to those things, since the reason for <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> is greater in one spouse than in the other, although there is sufficient reason for <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> in both. For <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> is a punishment of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, in so far as it is opposed to the marriage goods. Now as regards the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of fidelity to which husband and wife are equally bound towards each other, the <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> of one is as great a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against marriage as the <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> of the other, and this is in either of them a sufficient reason for <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a>. But as regards the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the offspring the wife's <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is a greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against marriage than the husband's wherefore it is a greater reason for <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> in the wife than in the husband: and thus they are under an equal <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, but not for equal reasons. Nor is this <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> for on either hand there is sufficient reason for the punishment in question, just as there is in two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> condemned to the punishment of death, although one of them may have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> more grievously than the other.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The only reason why <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> was permitted, was to avoid <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>. And since there was more danger of this in men than in <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, the husband was allowed to put away his wife by a bill of <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a>, but not "vice versa."

<p><strong>Reply to Objections 2 and 3.</strong> These arguments are based on the fact that in comparison with the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the offspring there is more reason for <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> in an <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulterous</a> wife than in an <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulterous</a> husband. It does not follow, however, that they are not judged on a par with each other.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Although the husband is the head of the wife, he is her pilot as it were, and is no more her judge than she is his. Consequently in matters that have to be submitted to a judge, the husband has no more power over his wife, than she over him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> In <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> there is the same <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> character as in simple fornication, and something more which aggravates it, namely the lesion to marriage. Accordingly if we consider that which is common to <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> and fornication, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the husband and that of the wife are compared the one to the other as that which exceeds to that which is exceeded, for in <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> the humors are more abundant, wherefore they are more inclined to be led by their <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a>, whereas in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> there is abundance of heat which excites <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. Simply speaking, however, other things being equal, a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> more grievously in simple fornication than a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, because he has more of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, which prevails over all movements of bodily <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. But as regards the lesion to marriage which <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> adds to fornication and for which reason it is an occasion for <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> more grievously than the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as appears from what we have said above. And since it is more grievous than simple fornication, it follows that, simply speaking, the <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulterous</a> wife <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> more grievously than the <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulterous</a> husband, other things being equal.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> Although the control which the husband receives over his wife is an aggravating circumstance, nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is yet more aggravated by this circumstance which draws the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to another <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, namely by the lesion to marriage, which lesion becomes a kind of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, through the fraudulent substitution of another's child.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether a husband can marry again after having a divorce?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a husband can marry again after having a <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a>. For no one is bound to perpetual <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>. Now in some cases the husband is bound to put away his wife forever on account of fornication, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Therefore seemingly at least in this case he can marry again.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a sinner should not be given a greater occasion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But if she who is put away on account of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of fornication is not allowed to seek another marriage, she is given a greater occasion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: for it is improbable that one who was not continent during marriage will be able to be continent afterwards. Therefore it would seem lawful for her to marry again.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the wife is not bound to the husband save as regards the payment of the marriage debt and cohabitation. But she is freed from both <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> by <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a>. Therefore "she is loosed from the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of her husband" [<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse2">Romans 7:2</a>]. Therefore she can marry again; and the same applies to her husband.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it is said (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse9">Matthew 19:9</a>): "Whosoever shall <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">put away</a> his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another committeth <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>." Therefore seemingly he does not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> if he marry again after putting away his wife on account of fornication, and consequently this will be a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> marriage.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse10">1 Corinthians 7:10-11</a>): "Not I, but the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, commandeth that the wife depart not from her husband. and, if she depart, that she remain unmarried."

<p>Further, no one should gain advantage from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But the adulteress would if she were allowed to contract another and more desired marriage; and an occasion of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> would be afforded those who wish to marry again. Therefore it is unlawful both to the wife and to the husband to contract a <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">second marriage</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Nothing supervenient to marriage can dissolve it: wherefore <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> does not make a marriage cease to be valid. For, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Nup. et Concup. i, 10), "as long as they live they are bound by the marriage tie, which neither <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> nor union with another can destroy." Therefore it is unlawful for one, while the other lives, to marry again.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although no one is absolutely bound to <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, he may be bound <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>; for instance, if his wife contract an incurable disease that is incompatible with carnal intercourse. And it is the same if she labor under a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> disease, namely fornication, so as to be incorrigible.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The very shame of having been <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a> ought to keep her from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and if it cannot keep her from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it is a lesser <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that she alone <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than that her husband take part in her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although after <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> the wife is not bound to her husband as regards paying him the marriage debt and cohabiting with him, the marriage tie, whereby she was bound to this, remains, and consequently she cannot marry again during her husband's lifetime. She can, however, take a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, against her husband's will, unless it seem that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has been deceived by <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> in pronouncing the <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a>; for in that case, even if she has made her <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of profession she ought to be restored to her husband, and would be bound to pay the marriage debt, but it would be unlawful for her to demand it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The exception expressed in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> words refers to the putting away of the wife. Hence the objection is based on a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> interpretation.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether husband and wife may be reconciled after being divorced?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that husband and wife may not be reconciled after being <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> contains the rule (Can. Quod bene semel, Caus. vi, qu. iv): "That which has been once well decided must not be subsequently withdrawn." Now it has been decided by the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that they ought to be separated. Therefore they cannot subsequently be reconciled.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if it were allowable for them to be reconciled, the husband would seem bound to receive his wife, especially after she has repented. But he is not bound, for the wife, in defending herself before the judge, cannot allege her repentance against her husband's accusation of fornication. Therefore in no way is reconciliation allowable.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if reconciliation were allowable, it would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulterous</a> wife is bound to return to her husband if her husband asks her. But she is not bound, since they are separated by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Therefore, etc.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, if it were lawful to be reconciled to an <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulterous</a> wife, this would especially be the case when the husband is found to have committed <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> after the <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a>. But in this case the wife cannot compel him to be reconciled, since the <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> has been <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> pronounced. Therefore she may nowise be reconciled.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, if a husband whose <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is unknown <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">put away</a> his wife, who is convicted of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> by the sentence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> would seem to have been pronounced <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>. And yet the husband is not bound to be reconciled to his wife, because she is unable to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> his <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> in court. Much less, therefore, is reconciliation allowable when the <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> has been granted <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse11">1 Corinthians 7:11</a>): "And if she depart, that she remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband."

<p>Further, it is allowable for the husband not to put her away after fornication. Therefore, for the same reason, he can be reconciled to her after <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> If the wife has mended her ways by repenting of her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> after the <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a>, her husband may become reconciled to her; but if she remain incorrigible in her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he must not take her back, for the same reason which forbade him to retain her while she refused to desist from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The sentence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in pronouncing the <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> did not bind them to separate, but allowed them to do so. Therefore reconciliation may be effected or ensue without any withdrawal of the previous sentence.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The wife's repentance should induce the husband not to accuse or <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">put away</a> the wife who is guilty of fornication. He cannot, however, be compelled to this course of action, nor can his wife oppose her repentance to his accusation, because although she is no longer guilty, neither in act nor in the stain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, there still remains something of the debt of punishment, and though this has been taken away in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, there still remains the debt of punishment to be inflicted by the judgment of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> sees not the heart as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> That which is done in a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> favor does him no prejudice. Wherefore since the <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> has been granted in favor of the husband, it does not deprive him of the right of asking for the marriage debt, or of asking his wife to return to him. Hence his wife is bound to pay the debt, and to return to him, if he ask her, unless with his consent she has taken a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> According to strict <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, a husband who was previously innocent should not be compelled to receive an <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulterous</a> wife on account of his having committed <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> after the <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a>. But according to equity, the judge is bound by virtue of his office first of all to admonish him to beware of imperiling his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and of scandalizing others; although the wife may not herself seek reconciliation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> If the husband's <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is secret, this does not deprive his <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulterous</a> wife of the right to allege it in self-defense, although she cannot <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> it. Wherefore the husband <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by seeking a <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a>, and if, after the sentence of <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a>, his wife asks for the marriage debt or for a reconciliation, the husband is bound to both.
