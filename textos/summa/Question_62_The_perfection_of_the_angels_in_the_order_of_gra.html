<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the angels were created in beatitude?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in beatitude. For it is stated (De Eccl. Dogm. xxix) that "the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who continue in the beatitude wherein they were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>, do not of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> possess the excellence they have." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in beatitude.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is nobler than the corporeal creature. But the corporeal creature straightway from its creation was made perfect and complete; nor did its lack of form take precedence in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, but only in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. i, 15). Therefore neither did <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> create the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> imperfect and incomplete. But its formation and perfection are derived from its beatitude, whereby it enjoys <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore it was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in beatitude.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. iv, 34; v, 5), the things which we read of as being made in the works of the six days, were made together at one time; and so all the six days must have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> instantly from the beginning of creation. But, according to his exposition, in those six days, "the morning" was the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, according to which they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the Word and things in the Word. Therefore straightway from their creation they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the Word, and things in the Word. But the bliss of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> comes of seeing the Word. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were in beatitude straightway from the very beginning of their creation.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> To be established or confirmed in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of beatitude. But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were not confirmed in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as soon as they were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>; the fall of some of them shows this. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were not in beatitude from their creation.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> By the name of beatitude is understood the ultimate perfection of rational or of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and hence it is that it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> desired, since everything <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> desires its ultimate perfection. Now there is a twofold ultimate perfection of rational or of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. The first is one which it can procure of its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power; and this is in a measure called beatitude or <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> (Ethic. x) says that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> ultimate <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in his most perfect <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, whereby in this life he can behold the best intelligible object; and that is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Above this <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> there is still another, which we look forward to in the future, whereby "we shall see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as He is." This is beyond the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of every <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as was shown above (Question 12, Article 4).

<p>So, then, it remains to be said, that, as regards this first beatitude, which the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> could procure by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power, he was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> already blessed. Because the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> does not acquire such beatitude by any progressive action, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does, but, as was observed above (58, 3,4), is straightway in possession thereof, owing to his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> dignity. But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> did not have from the beginning of their creation that ultimate beatitude which is beyond the power of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; because such beatitude is no part of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but its end; and consequently they ought not to have it immediately from the beginning.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Beatitude is there taken for that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> perfection which the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> had in the state of innocence.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The corporeal creature instantly in the beginning of its creation could not have the perfection to which it is brought by its operation; consequently, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad. lit. v, 4,23; viii, 3), the growing of plants from the earth did not take place at once among the first works, in which only the germinating power of the plants was bestowed upon the earth. In the same way, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> creature in the beginning of its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> had the perfection of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; but it did not have the perfection to which it had to come by its operation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> has a twofold <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Word; the one which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, and the other according to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. He has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> whereby he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the Word through a similitude thereof shining in his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and he has a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> whereby he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the Word through His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. By both kinds of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> things in the Word; imperfectly by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and perfectly by his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Therefore the first <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things in the Word was present to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> from the outset of his creation; while the second was not, but only when the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> became blessed by turning to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. And this is properly termed their morning <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether an angel needs grace in order to turn to God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> had no need of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in order to turn to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For, we have no need of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> for what we can accomplish <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> turns to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: because he loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, as is clear from what has been said (60, 5). Therefore an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> did not need <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in order to turn to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, seemingly we need help only for difficult tasks. Now it was not a difficult task for the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to turn to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; because there was no obstacle in him to such turning. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> had no need of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in order to turn to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to turn oneself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is to dispose oneself for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; hence it is said (<a href="../bible/zec001.htm#verse3">Zechariah 1:3</a>): "Turn ye to Me, and I will turn to you." But we do not stand in need of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in order to prepare ourselves for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: for thus we should go on to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> did not need <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to turn to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It was by turning to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> reached to beatitude. If, then, he had needed no <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in order to turn to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it would follow that he did not require <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in order to possess everlasting life. But this is contrary to the saying of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse23">Romans 6:23</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is life everlasting."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> stood in need of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in order to turn to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the object of beatitude. For, as was observed above (Question 60, Article 2) the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the principle of all things that we will. But the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination is directed towards what is in keeping with its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore, if there is anything which is above <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> cannot be inclined towards it, unless helped by some other <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> principle. Thus it is clear that fire has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> tendency to give forth heat, and to generate fire; whereas to generate flesh is beyond the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power of fire; consequently, fire has no tendency thereto, except in so far as it is moved instrumentally by the nutritive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p>Now it was shown above (12, 4,5), when we were treating of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, that to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, wherein the ultimate beatitude of the rational creature consists, is beyond the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of every <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Consequently no rational creature can have the movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> directed towards such beatitude, except it be moved thereto by a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> agent. This is what we call the help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore it must be said that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> could not of his own will be turned to such beatitude, except by the help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, so far as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the author of his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> being. But here we are speaking of turning to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so far as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> bestows beatitude by the vision of His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A thing is "difficult" which is beyond a power; and this happens in two ways.

<p>First of all, because it is beyond the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> capacity of the power. Thus, if it can be attained by some help, it is said to be "difficult"; but if it can in no way be attained, then it is "impossible"; thus it is impossible for a man to fly. In another way a thing may be beyond the power, not according to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order of such power, but owing to some intervening hindrance; as to mount upwards is not contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order of the motive power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; because the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, considered in itself, can be moved in any direction; but is hindered from so doing by the weight of the body; consequently it is difficult for a man to mount upwards. To be turned to his ultimate beatitude is difficult for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, both because it is beyond his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and because he has a hindrance from the corruption of the body and infection of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But it is difficult for an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, only because it is <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Every movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can be termed a conversion to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And so there is a threefold turning to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The first is by the perfect love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; this belongs to the creature enjoying the possession of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and for such conversion, consummae <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is required. The next turning to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is that which <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> beatitude; and for this there is required <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which is the principle of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. The third conversion is that whereby a man disposes himself so that he may have <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; for this no <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is required; but the operation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who draws the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> towards Himself, according to <a href="../bible/lam005.htm#verse21">Lamentations 5:21</a>: "Convert us, O Lord, to Thee, and we shall be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>." Hence it is clear that there is no need to go on to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the angels were created in grace?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were not <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. ii, 8) that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was first made without form, and was called "<a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>": but afterwards it received its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, and was then called "light." But such formation comes from <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore they were not <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> turns the rational creature towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. If, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> had been <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, no <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> would ever have turned away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> comes midway between <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were not beatified in their <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">creation</a>. Therefore it seems that they were not <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; but that they were first <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> only, and then received <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and that last of all they were beatified.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xii, 9), "Who wrought the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>? Who, save Him Who <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> them with His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, that is, with the pure love wherewith they cling to Him; at the same time building up their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and bestowing <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> on them?"

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Although there are conflicting opinions on this point, some holding that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> only in a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> state, while others maintain that they were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; yet it seems more probable, and more in keeping with the sayings of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, that they were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>. For we see that all things which, in the process of time, being <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by the work of Divine Providence, were produced by the operation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in the first fashioning of things according to seedlike forms, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. viii, 3), such as trees, animals, and the rest. Now it is evident that <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> bears the same relation to beatitude as the seedlike form in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> does to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> effect; hence (<a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse9">1 John 3:9</a>) <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is called the "seed" of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. As, then, in <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine's</a> opinion it is contended that the seedlike forms of all <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> effects were implanted in the creature when corporeally <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>, so straightway from the beginning the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Such absence of form in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> can be understood either by comparison with their formation in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; and so the absence of formation preceded formation by priority of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Or else it can be understood of the formation according to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: and so it did not precede in the order of time, but in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> holds with regard to the formation of corporeal things (Gen. ad lit. i, 15).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Every form inclines the subject after the mode of the subject's <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now it is the mode of an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to be inclined freely towards the objects it desires. Consequently the movement of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> does not impose <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>; but he who has <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> can fail to make use of it, and can <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> comes midway between <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, nevertheless, in the order of time, in <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is not simultaneous with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; because <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is the end of the operation of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> helped by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> stands not as the end of operation, because it is not of works, but as the principle of right operation. Therefore it was fitting for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to be given straightway with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether an angel merits his beatitude?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> did not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> his beatitude. For <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> arises from the difficulty of the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> act. But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> experienced no difficulty in acting rightly. Therefore righteous action was not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> for him.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, we do not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> by merely <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> operations. But it was quite <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> for the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to turn to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore he did not thereby <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> beatitude.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if a beatified <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> his beatitude, he did so either before he had it, or else afterwards. But it was not before; because, in the opinion of many, he had no <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> before whereby to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> it. Nor did he <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> it afterwards, because thus he would be meriting it now; which is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, because in that case a lower <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> could by meriting rise up to the rank of a higher, and the distinct degrees of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> would not be permanent; which is not admissible. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> did not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> his beatitude.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is stated (<a href="../bible/rev021.htm#verse17">Apocalypse 21:17</a>) that the "measure of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>" in that heavenly Jerusalem is "the measure of a man." Therefore the same is the case with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Perfect beatitude is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> only to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> and beatitude are one and the same thing in Him. Beatitude, however, is not of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the creature, but is its end. Now everything attains its last end by its operation. Such operation leading to the end is either productive of the end, when such end is not beyond the power of the agent working for the end, as the healing art is productive of health; or else it is deserving of the end, when such end is beyond the capacity of the agent striving to attain it; wherefore it is looked for from another's bestowing. Now it is evident from what has gone before (1,2; 12, 4,5), ultimate beatitude exceeds both the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. It remains, then, that both <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> their beatitude.

<p>And if the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, without which there is no <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, there would be no difficulty in saying that he <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> beatitude: as also, if one were to say that he had <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in any way before he had <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p>But if he had no <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> before entering upon beatitude, it would then have to be said that he had beatitude without <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, even as we have <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. This, however, is quite foreign to the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of beatitude; which conveys the notion of an end, and is the reward of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as even the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. i, 9). Or else it will have to be said, as some others have maintained, that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> beatitude by their present ministrations, while in beatitude. This is quite contrary, again, to the notion of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>: since <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> conveys the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a means to an end; while what is already in its end cannot, properly speaking, be moved towards such end; and so no one <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> to produce what he already enjoys. Or else it will have to be said that one and the same act of turning to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so far as it comes of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, is <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>; and so far as it attains the end, is the fruition of beatitude. Even this view will not stand, because <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is not the sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>; and, consequently, an act cannot be <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> as coming from <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, except in so far as it is informed by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; but it cannot at the same time be informed by imperfect <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which is the principle of meriting, and by perfect <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which is the principle of enjoying. Hence it does not appear to be possible for anyone to enjoy beatitude, and at the same time to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> it.

<p>Consequently it is better to say that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> had <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> ere he was admitted to beatitude, and that by such <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> he <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> beatitude.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> difficulty of working righteously does not come from any contrariety or hindrance of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers; but from the fact that the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work is beyond his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> capacity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> An <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> did not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> beatitude by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> movement towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but by the movement of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which comes of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p>The answer to the Third Objection is evident from what we have said.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the angel obtained beatitude immediately after one act of merit?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> did not possess beatitude instantly after one act of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. For it is more difficult for a man to do well than for an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not rewarded at once after one act of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. Therefore neither was the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> could act at once, and in an instant, from the very outset of his creation, for even <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> bodies begin to be moved in the very instant of their creation; and if the movement of a body could be instantaneous, like operations of mind and will, it would have movement in the first instant of its generation. Consequently, if the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> beatitude by one act of his will, he <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> it in the first instant of his creation; and so, if their beatitude was not retarded, then the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were in beatitude in the first instant.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, there must be many intervals between things which are far apart. But the beatific state of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> is very far remote from their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>: while <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> comes midway between. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> would have to pass through many stages of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> in order to reach beatitude.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> are ordained alike for beatitude: consequently equality with <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> is promised to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> separated from the body, if it has <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> deserving beatitude, enters at once into beatitude, unless there be some obstacle. Therefore so does an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. Now an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> instantly, in his first <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, had the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of beatitude. Therefore, since there was no obstacle within him, he passed at once into beatitude by only one <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> act.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> was beatified instantly after the first <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, whereby he <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> beatitude. The reason whereof is because <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> perfects <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> according to the manner of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; as every perfection is received in the subject capable of perfection, according to its mode. Now it is proper to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to receive its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> perfection not by passing from one stage to another; but to have it at once <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, as was shown above (1; 58, 3,4). But as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is of his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> inclined to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> perfection, so is he by <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> inclined to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Hence instantly after <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> secured beatitude. Now the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of beatitude in <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> alike can be from merely one act; because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> beatitude by every act informed by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Hence it remains that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> was beatified straightway after one <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Man was not intended to secure his ultimate perfection at once, like the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. Hence a longer way was assigned to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> than to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> for securing beatitude.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is above the time of corporeal things; hence the various instants regarding the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are not to be taken except as reckoning the succession of their acts. Now their act which <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> beatitude could not be in them simultaneously with the act of beatitude, which is fruition; since the one belongs to imperfect <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and the other to consummate <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Consequently, it remains for different instants to be conceived, in one of which the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> beatitude, and in another was beatified.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> instantly to attain the perfection unto which he is ordained. Consequently, only one <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> act is required; which act can so far be called an interval as through it the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is brought to beatitude.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the angels receive grace and glory according to the degree of their natural gifts?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> did not receive <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> according to the degree of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is bestowed of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> absolute will. Therefore the degree of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> depends on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will, and not on the degree of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a moral act seems to be more closely allied with <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> than <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is; because a moral act is preparatory to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> does not come "of works," as is said in <a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse6">Romans 11:6</a>. Therefore much less does the degree of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> depend upon the degree of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> are alike ordained for beatitude or <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not receive more <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> according to the degree of his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>. Therefore neither does the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Is the saying of the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master of the Sentences</a> (Sent. ii, D, 3) that "those <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> with more subtle natures and of keener <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> in wisdom, were likewise endowed with greater <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is reasonable to suppose that <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> and perfection of beatitude were bestowed on the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> according to the degree of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>. The reason for this can be drawn from two sources.

<p>First of all, on the part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who, in the order of His wisdom, established various degrees in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for attaining <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and beatitude, so likewise the grades of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> seem to be ordained for the various degrees of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; just as when, for example, the builder chisels the stones for building a house, from the fact that he prepares some more artistically and more fittingly than others, it is clear that he is setting them apart for the more ornate part of the house. So it seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> destined those <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> for greater <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and fuller beatitude, whom He made of a higher <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p>Secondly, the same is evident on the part of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is not a compound of different <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, so that the inclination of the one thwarts or retards the tendency of the other; as happens in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in whom the movement of his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> part is either retarded or thwarted by the inclination of his sensitive part. But when there is nothing to retard or thwart it, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is moved with its whole energy. So it is reasonable to suppose that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who had a higher <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, were turned to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more mightily and efficaciously. The same thing happens in men, since greater <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> are bestowed according to the greater earnestness of their turning to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence it appears that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who had the greater <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers, had the more <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> comes of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will alone, so likewise does the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>: and as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will ordained <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, so did it ordain the various degrees of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to the various degrees of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The acts of the rational creature are from the creature itself; whereas <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is immediately from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Accordingly it seems rather that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is bestowed according to degree of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> than according to works.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Diversity of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> is in one way in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who are themselves different specifically; and in quite another way in men, who differ only numerically. For specific difference is on account of the end; while numerical difference is because of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Furthermore, there is something in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> which can thwart or impede the movement of his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; but not in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Consequently the argument is not the same for both.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether natural knowledge and love remain in the beatified angels?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and love do not remain in the beatified <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For it is said (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse10">1 Corinthians 13:10</a>): "When that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away." But <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> are imperfect in comparison with beatified <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and love. Therefore, in beatitude, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and love cease.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, where one suffices, another is superfluous. But the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and love of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> suffice for the beatified <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Therefore it would be superfluous for their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and love to remain.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the same faculty has not two simultaneous acts, as the same line cannot, at the same end, be terminated in two points. But the beatified <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are always exercising their beatified <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and love; for, as is said Ethic. i, 8, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists not in <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, but in act. Therefore there can never be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and love in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> So long as a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> endures, its operation remains. But beatitude does not destroy <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, since it is its perfection. Therefore it does not take away <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and love.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Natural <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and love remain in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For as principles of operations are mutually related, so are the operations themselves. Now it is manifest that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is to beatitude as first to second; because beatitude is superadded to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But the first must ever be preserved in the second. Consequently <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> must be preserved in beatitude: and in like manner the act of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> must be preserved in the act of beatitude.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The advent of a perfection removes the opposite imperfection. Now the imperfection of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not opposed to the perfection of beatitude, but underlies it; as the imperfection of the power underlies the perfection of the form, and the power is not taken away by the form, but the privation which is opposed to the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. In the same way, the imperfection of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not opposed to the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; for nothing hinders us from <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> a thing through various mediums, as a thing may be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> at the one time through a probable medium and through a demonstrative one. In like manner, an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, and this appertains to his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; and at the same time he can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by his own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, which belongs to his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> All things which make up beatitude are sufficient of themselves. But in order for them to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, they presuppose the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>; because no beatitude is self-subsisting, except the uncreated beatitude.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There cannot be two operations of the one faculty at the one time, except the one be ordained to the other. But <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and love are ordained to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and love of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Accordingly there is nothing to hinder <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and love from <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> conjointly with those of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether a beatified angel can sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a beatified <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For, as was said above (<a href="#7">Article 7</a>), beatitude does not do away with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But it is of the very notion of <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, that it can fail. Therefore a beatified <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the rational powers are referred to opposites, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> observes (Metaph. iv, text. 3). But the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> in beatitude does not cease to be rational. Therefore it is inclined towards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it belongs to the liberty of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be able to choose <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But the freedom of <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not lessened in the beatified <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Therefore they can <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xi) that "there is in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which cannot <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The beatified <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. The reason for this is, because their beatitude consists in seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Now, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> beholding <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is disposed towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the same way as anyone else not seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is to the common form of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Now it is impossible for any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> either to will or to do anything except aiming at what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; or for him to wish to turn away from <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> precisely as such. Therefore the beatified <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can neither will nor act, except as aiming towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now whoever wills or acts in this manner cannot <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Consequently the beatified <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Created <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, considered in itself, can fail. But from its perfect union with the uncreated <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, such as is the union of beatitude, it is rendered unable to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for the reason already alleged.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The rational powers are referred to opposites in the things to which they are not inclined <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>; but as to the things whereunto they have a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> tendency, they are not referred to opposites. For the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> cannot but assent to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> principles; in the same way, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> cannot help clinging to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, formally as <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; because the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> ordained to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as to its proper object. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> is referred to opposites, as to doing many things, or not doing them. But they have no tendency to opposites with regard to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, Whom they see to be the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>; but in all things their aim is towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which ever alternative they choose, that is not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Free-will in its choice of means to an end is disposed just as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is to conclusions. Now it is evident that it belongs to the power of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to be able to proceed to different conclusions, according to given principles; but for it to proceed to some conclusion by passing out of the order of the principles, comes of its own defect. Hence it belongs to the perfection of its liberty for the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> to be able to choose between opposite things, keeping the order of the end in view; but it comes of the defect of liberty for it to choose anything by turning away from the order of the end; and this is to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Hence there is greater liberty of will in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who cannot <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, than there is in ourselves, who can <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether the beatified angels advance in beatitude?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the beatified <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> can advance in beatitude. For <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is the principle of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. But there is perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Therefore the beatified <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> can <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. Now, as <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> increases, the reward of beatitude increases. Therefore the beatified <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> can progress in beatitude.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. i) that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> makes use of us for our own gain, and for His own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. The same thing happens to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, whom He uses for <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> ministrations"; since "they are all [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Are they not all . . .?'] ministering spirits, sent to minister for them who shall receive the inheritance of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>" (<a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse14">Hebrews 1:14</a>). This would not be for their profit were they not to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> thereby, nor to advance to beatitude. It remains, then, that the beatified <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> can <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, and can advance in beatitude.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it argues imperfection for anyone not occupying the foremost place not to be able to advance. But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are not in the highest degree of beatitude. Therefore if unable to ascend higher, it would appear that there is imperfection and defect in them; which is not admissible.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Merit and progress belong to this present <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of life. But <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are not wayfarers travelling towards beatitude, they are already in possession of beatitude. Consequently the beatified <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> can neither <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> nor advance in beatitude.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In every movement the mover's <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is centered upon one determined end, to which he intends to lead the movable subject; because <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> looks to the end, to which <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> progress is repugnant. Now it is evident, since the rational creature cannot of its own power attain to its beatitude, which consists in the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a>, as is clear from what has gone before (12, 4), that it needs to be moved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> towards its beatitude. Therefore there must be some one determined thing to which every rational creature is directed as to its last end.

<p>Now this one determinate object cannot, in the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a>, consist precisely in that which is seen; for the Supreme Truth is seen by all the blessed in various degrees: but it is on the part of the mode of vision, that diverse terms are fixed beforehand by the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of Him Who directs towards the end. For it is impossible that as the rational creature is led on to the vision of the Supreme Essence, it should be led on in the same way to the supreme mode of vision, which is comprehension, for this belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> only; as is evident from what was said above (12, 7; 14, 3). But since <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> efficacy is required for comprehending <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while the creature's efficacy in beholding is only finite; and since every finite being is in <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> degrees removed from the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>; it comes to pass that the rational creature understands <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more or less clearly according to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> degrees. And as beatitude consists in vision, so the degree of vision lies in a determinate mode of the vision.

<p>Therefore every rational creature is so led by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to the end of its beatitude, that from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> it is brought even to a determinate degree of beatitude. Consequently, when that degree is once secured, it cannot pass to a higher degree.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Merit belongs to a subject which is moving towards its end. Now the rational creature is moved towards its end, not merely passively, but also by working actively. If the end is within the power of the rational creature, then its action is said to procure the end; as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> acquires <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by reflection: but if the end be beyond its power, and is looked for from another, then the action will be <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> of such end. But what is already in the ultimate term is not said to be moved, but to have been moved. Consequently, to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> belongs to the imperfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of this life; whereas perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> does not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> but rather enjoys the reward. Even as in acquired <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, the operation preceding the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is productive of the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>; but the operation from an acquired <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is both perfect and enjoyable. In the same way the act of perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> has no <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, but belongs rather to the perfection of the reward.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A thing can be termed useful in two ways.

<p>First of all, as being on the way to an end; and so the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of beatitude is useful.

<p>Secondly, as the part is useful for the whole; as the wall for a house. In this way the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> ministerings are useful for the beatified <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, inasmuch as they are a part of their beatitude; for to pour out acquired perfection upon others is of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of what is perfect, considered as perfect.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although a beatified <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is not absolutely in the highest degree of beatitude, yet, in his own regard he is in the highest degree, according to Divine <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>. Nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> can be increased with regard to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of such as are saved by their ministrations, according to <a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse10">Luke 15:10</a>: "There is [Vulg.'shall be'] <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> before the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> upon one sinner doing penance." Such <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> belongs to their <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> reward, which can be increased unto <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">judgment day</a>. Hence some writers say that they can <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> as to their <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> reward. But it is better to say that the Blessed can in no wise <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> without being at the same time a wayfarer and a comprehensor; like <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who alone was such. For the Blessed acquire such <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> from the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of their beatitude, rather than <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> it.
