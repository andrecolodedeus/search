<h1>Question 62. The sacraments' principal effect, which is grace</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/4062.htm#article1"> Are the sacraments of the New Law the cause of grace?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4062.htm#article2"> Does sacramental grace confer anything in addition to the grace of the virtues and gifts?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4062.htm#article3"> Do the sacraments contain grace?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4062.htm#article4"> Is there any power in them for the causing of grace?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4062.htm#article5"> Do the sacraments derive this power from Christ's Passion?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4062.htm#article6"> Did the sacraments of the Old Law cause grace?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the sacraments are the cause of grace?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For it seems that the same thing is not both sign and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: since the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of sign appears to be more in keeping with an effect. But a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is a sign of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore it is not its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, nothing corporeal can act on a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> thing: since "the agent is more excellent than the patient," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii). But the subject of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind, which is something <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, what is proper to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should not be ascribed to a creature. But it is proper to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa083.htm#verse12">Psalm 83:12</a>: "The Lord will give <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>." Since, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> consist in certain words and <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things, it seems that they cannot <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. lxxx in Joan.) that the baptismal water "touches the body and cleanses the heart." But the heart is not cleansed save through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: and for like reason so do the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We must needs say that in some way the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For it is evident that through the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is incorporated with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: thus the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> (<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse27">Galatians 3:27</a>): "As many of you as have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> have put on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." And <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is made a member of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> alone.

<p>Some, however, say that they are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> not by their own operation, but in so far as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> when the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are employed. And they give as an example a man who on presenting a leaden coin, receives, by the king's command, a hundred pounds: not as though the leaden coin, by any operation of its own, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to be given that sum of money; this being the effect of the mere will of the king. Hence <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">Bernard</a> says in a sermon on the Lord's Supper: "Just as a canon is invested by means of a book, an abbot by means of a <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crozier</a>, a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by means of a <a href="../cathen/13059a.htm">ring</a>, so by the various <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> various kinds of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> are conferred." But if we examine the question properly, we shall see that according to the above mode the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are mere signs. For the leaden coin is nothing but a sign of the king's command that this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should receive money. In like manner the book is a sign of the conferring of a canonry. Hence, according to this opinion the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> would be mere signs of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; whereas we have it on the authority of many <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> not only signify, but also <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p>We must therefore say otherwise, that an efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is twofold, principal and instrumental. The principal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> works by the power of its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, to which form the effect is likened; just as fire by its own heat makes something hot. In this way none but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: since <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is nothing else than a participated likeness of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, according to <a href="../bible/2pe001.htm#verse4">2 Peter 1:4</a>: "He hath given us most great and precious promises; that we may be [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'you may be made'] partakers of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>." But the instrumental <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> works not by the power of its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, but only by the motion whereby it is moved by the principal agent: so that the effect is not likened to the instrument but to the principal agent: for instance, the couch is not like the axe, but like the art which is in the craftsman's mind. And it is thus that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: for they are instituted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be employed for the purpose of conferring <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Faust. xix): "All these things," viz. pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, "are done and pass away, but the power," viz. of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, "which works by them, remains ever." Now that is, properly speaking, an instrument by which someone works: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/tit003.htm#verse5">Titus 3:5</a>): "He saved us by the laver of regeneration."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The principal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> cannot properly be called a sign of its effect, even though the latter be hidden and the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> itself sensible and manifest. But an instrumental <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, if manifest, can be called a sign of a hidden effect, for this reason, that it is not merely a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> but also in a measure an effect in so far as it is moved by the principal agent. And in this sense the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> are both <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and signs. Hence, too, is it that, to use the common expression, "they effect what they signify." From this it is clear that they perfectly fulfil the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; being ordained to something sacred, not only as a sign, but also as a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> An instrument has a twofold action; one is instrumental, in respect of which it works not by its own power but by the power of the principal agent: the other is its proper action, which belongs to it in respect of its proper form: thus it belongs to an axe to cut asunder by reason of its sharpness, but to make a couch, in so far as it is the instrument of an art. But it does not accomplish the instrumental action save by exercising its proper action: for it is by cutting that it makes a couch. In like manner the corporeal <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> by their operation, which they exercise on the body that they touch, accomplish through the Divine institution an instrumental operation on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; for example, the water of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, in respect of its proper power, cleanses the body, and thereby, inasmuch as it is the instrument of the Divine power, cleanses the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: since from <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body one thing is made. And thus it is that <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii) that it "touches the body and cleanses the heart."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument considers that which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> as principal agent; for this belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, as stated above.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether sacramental grace confers anything in addition to the grace of the virtues and gifts?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that sacramental <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> confers nothing in addition to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> perfects the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> sufficiently, both in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and in its powers; as is clear from what was said in I-II, 110, 3,4. But <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is ordained to the perfecting of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore sacramental <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> cannot confer anything in addition to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> defects are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are sufficiently removed by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>: because there is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that is not contrary to some <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Since, therefore, sacramental <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is ordained to the removal of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> defects, it cannot confer anything in addition to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every addition or subtraction of form varies the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> (Metaph. viii). If, therefore, sacramental <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> confers anything in addition to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, it follows that it is called <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> equivocally: and so we are none the wiser when it is said that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> If sacramental <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> confers nothing in addition to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, it is useless to confer the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> on those who have the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>. But there is nothing useless in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> works. Therefore it seems that sacramental <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> confers something in addition to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated in I-II, 110, 3,4, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, considered in itself, perfects the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in so far as it is a certain participated likeness of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>. And just as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> powers flow from its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, so from <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> there flow certain perfections into the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which are called <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, whereby the powers are perfected in reference to their actions. Now the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are ordained unto certain special effects which are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life: thus <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is ordained unto a certain <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> regeneration, by which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> dies to <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> and becomes a member of Christ: which effect is something special in addition to the actions of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> powers: and the same holds <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Consequently just as the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> confer, in addition to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> commonly so called, a certain special perfection ordained to the powers' proper actions, so does sacramental <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> confer, over and above <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> commonly so called, and in addition to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, a certain Divine assistance in obtaining the end of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. It is thus that sacramental <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> confers something in addition to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> perfects the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> sufficiently as regards ordinary conduct: but as regards certain special effects which are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life, sacramental <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is needed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Vices and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are sufficiently removed by <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, as to present and future time. in so far as they prevent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>. But in regard to past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, the acts of which are transitory whereas their guilt remains, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is provided with a special remedy in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Sacramental <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is compared to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> commonly so called, as <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> to genus. Wherefore just as it is not equivocal to use the term "animal" in its generic sense, and as applied to a man, so neither is it equivocal to speak of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> commonly so called and of sacramental <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the sacraments of the New Law contain grace?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> do not contain <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For it seems that what is contained is in the container. But <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>; neither as in a subject, because the subject of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not a body but a spirit; nor as in a vessel, for according to Phys. iv, "a vessel is a movable place," and an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> cannot be in a place. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> do not contain <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are instituted as means whereby men may obtain <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But since <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> it cannot pass from one subject to another. Therefore it would be of no account if <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> were in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> thing is not contained by a corporeal, even if it be therein; for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not contained by the body; rather does it contain the body. Since, therefore, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is something <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, it seems that it cannot be contained in a corporeal sacrament.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Hugh of S. Victor says (De Sacram. i) that "a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, through its being sanctified, contains an invisible <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing is said to be in another in various ways; in two of which <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is said to be in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. First, as in its sign; for a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is a sign of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Secondly, as in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; for, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>) a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is an instrumental <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is in a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, not as to its specific likeness, as an effect in its univocal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; nor as to some proper and permanent form proportioned to such an effect, as effects in non-univocal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, for instance, as things generated are in the sun; but as to a certain instrumental power transient and incomplete in its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> being, as will be explained later on (4).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Grace</a> is said to be in a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> not as in its subject; nor as in a vessel considered as a place, but understood as the instrument of some work to be done, according to <a href="../bible/eze009.htm#verse1">Ezekiel 9:1</a>: "Everyone hath a destroying vessel [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'weapon'] in his hand."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> does not pass from one subject to another, nevertheless in a fashion it does pass from its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> into its subject through the instrument; not so that it be in each of these in the same way, but in each according to its respective <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> thing <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> perfectly in something, it contains it and is not contained by it. But, in a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> has a passing and incomplete mode of being: and consequently it is not unfitting to say that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> contain <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether there be in the sacraments a power of causing grace?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that there is not in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> a power of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For the power of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power. But a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power cannot be in a body; neither as proper to it, because power flows from a thing's <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and consequently cannot transcend it; nor as derived from something else, because that which is received into anything follows the mode of the recipient. Therefore in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> there is no power of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> is reducible to some kind of being and some degree of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But there is no assignable kind of being to which such a power can belong; as anyone may see by running. through them all. Nor is it reducible to some degree of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; for neither is it one of the goods of least account, since <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: nor is it an intermediate <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, such as are the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers; nor is it one of the greater goods, for it is neither <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> nor a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. Therefore it seems that in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> there is no power of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if there be such a power in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, its presence there must be due to nothing less than a creative act of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But it seems unbecoming that so excellent a being <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should cease to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> as soon as the sacrament is complete. Therefore it seems that in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> there is no power for <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the same thing cannot be in several. But several things concur in the completion of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, namely, words and things: while in one sacrament there can be but one power. Therefore it seems that there is no power of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. lxxx in Joan.): "Whence hath water so great power, that it touches the body and cleanses the heart?" And <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> says that "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> conferred a power of regeneration on the waters by the contact of His most pure body."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Those who hold that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> do not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> save by a certain coincidence, deny the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> any power that is itself productive of the sacramental effect, and hold that the Divine power assists the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and produces their effect. But if we hold that a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is an instrumental <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, we must needs allow that there is in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> a certain instrumental power of bringing about the sacramental effects. Now such power is proportionate to the instrument: and consequently it stands in comparison to the complete and perfect power of anything, as the instrument to the principal agent. For an instrument, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), does not work save as moved by the principal agent, which works of itself. And therefore the power of the principal agent <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> completely and perfectly: whereas the instrumental power has a being that passes from one thing into another, and is incomplete; just as motion is an imperfect act passing from agent to patient.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power cannot be in a corporeal subject, after the manner of a permanent and complete power, as the argument proves. But there is nothing to hinder an instrumental <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power from being in a body; in so far as a body can be moved by a particular <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> so as to produce a particular <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> effect; thus in the very voice which is perceived by the senses there is a certain <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power, inasmuch as it proceeds from a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> concept, of arousing the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the hearer. It is in this way that a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power is in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, inasmuch as they are ordained by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> unto the production of a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> effect.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as motion, through being an imperfect act, is not properly in a genus, but is reducible to a genus of perfect act, for instance, alteration to the genus of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>: so, instrumental power, properly speaking, is not in any genus, but is reducible to a genus and <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of perfect act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Just as an instrumental power accrues to an instrument through its being moved by the principal agent, so does a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> receive <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power from Christ's <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> and from the action of the minister in applying it to a sacramental use. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a sermon on the Epiphany (St. Maximus of Turin, Serm. xii): "Nor should you marvel, if we say that water, a corporeal <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, achieves the cleansing of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. It does indeed, and penetrates every secret hiding-place of the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. For subtle and clear as it is, the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> makes it yet more subtle, so that it permeates into the very principles of life and searches the inner-most recesses of the heart."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Just as the one same power of the principal agent is instrumentally in all the instruments that are ordained unto the production of an effect, forasmuch as they are one as being so ordained: so also the one same sacramental power is in both words and things, forasmuch as words and things combine to form one sacrament.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the sacraments of the New Law derive their power from Christ's Passion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> do not derive their power from <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>. For the power of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which is the principle of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. xix in Joan.): "The Word, as He was in the beginning with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, quickens <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; as He was made flesh, quickens bodies." Since, therefore, <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> pertains to the Word as made flesh, it seems that it cannot <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the power of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the power of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> seems to depend on <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. for as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. lxxx in Joan.), the Divine Word perfects the sacrament "not because it is spoken, but because it is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>." But our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> regards not only <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, but also the other mysteries of His humanity, and in a yet higher measure, His Godhead. Therefore it seems that the power of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> is not due specially to <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are ordained unto <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse11">1 Corinthians 6:11</a>: "You are washed . . . you are justified." Now justification is ascribed to the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse25">Romans 4:25</a>: "(Who) rose again for our <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>." Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> derive their power from <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's Resurrection</a> rather than from His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> on <a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse14">Romans 5:14</a>: "After the similitude of the transgression of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>," etc., the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "From the side of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> asleep on the Cross flowed the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which brought <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>." Consequently, it seems that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> derive their power from <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>) a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> in <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> works after the manner of an instrument. Now an instrument is twofold. the one, separate, as a stick, for instance; the other, united, as a hand. Moreover, the separate instrument is moved by means of the united instrument, as a stick by the hand. Now the principal efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, in comparison with Whom <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> humanity is as a united instrument, whereas the sacrament is as a separate instrument. Consequently, the saving power must needs be derived by the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Godhead through His humanity.

<p>Now sacramental <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> seems to be ordained principally to two things: namely, to take away the defects consequent on past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, in so far as they are transitory in act, but endure in guilt; and, further, to perfect the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in things pertaining to Divine Worship in regard to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Religion. But it is manifest from what has been stated above (48, 1,2,6; 49, 1,3) that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> delivered us from our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> principally through His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, not only by way of efficiency and <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, but also by way of satisfaction. Likewise by His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> He inaugurated the Rites of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Religion by offering "Himself--an oblation and a sacrifice to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse2">Ephesians 5:2</a>). Wherefore it is manifest that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> derive their power specially from <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of which is in a manner united to us by our receiving the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. It was in sign of this that from the side of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> hanging on the Cross there flowed water and blood, the former of which belongs to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, the latter to the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, which are the principal <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The Word, forasmuch as He was in the beginning with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, quickens <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> as principal agent; but His flesh, and the mysteries accomplished therein, are as instrumental <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> in the process of giving life to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: while in giving life to the body they act not only as instrumental <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, but also to a certain extent as exemplars, as we stated above (56, 1, ad 3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> dwells in us "by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>" (<a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse17">Ephesians 3:17</a>). Consequently, by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> power is united to us. Now the power of blotting out <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> belongs in a special way to His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. And therefore men are delivered from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> especially by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse25">Romans 3:25</a>: "Whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath proposed to be a propitiation through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in His Blood." Therefore the power of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which is ordained unto the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is derived principally from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Justification is ascribed to the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> by reason of the term "whither," which is newness of life through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But it is ascribed to the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> by reason of the term "whence," i.e. in regard to the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the sacraments of the Old Law caused grace?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For, as stated above (5, ad 2) the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> derive their efficacy from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. But there was <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, as well as under the New, since we have "the same spirit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>" (<a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse13">2 Corinthians 4:13</a>). Therefore just as the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> confer <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, so did the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, there is no sanctification save by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But men were sanctified by the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>: for it is written (<a href="../bible/lev008.htm#verse31">Leviticus 8:31</a>): "And when he," i.e. <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, "had sanctified them," i.e. <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> and his sons, "in their <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a>," etc. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> conferred <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> says in a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> on the Circumcision: "Under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> provided the same health-giving balm against the wound of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in the time of revealed <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>." But <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> confers <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> now. Therefore <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> conferred <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; and in like manner, the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>; for just as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is the door of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, so was <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> the door of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>: hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse3">Galatians 5:3</a>): "I testify to every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> circumcising himself, that he is a debtor to the whole <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse9">Galatians 4:9</a>): "Turn you again to the weak and needy elements?" i.e. "to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>," says the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a>, "which is called weak, because it does not justify perfectly." But <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> justifies perfectly. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the old Law did not confer <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It cannot be said that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> conferred <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> of themselves, i.e. by their own power: since thus <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> would not have been <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, according to <a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse21">Galatians 2:21</a>: "If <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> be by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, then <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> died in vain."

<p>But neither can it be said that they derived the power of conferring <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> from <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>. For as it was stated above (5), the power of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> is united to us by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, but in different ways; because the link that comes from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is produced by an act of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; whereas the link that comes from the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, is produced by making use of exterior things. Now nothing hinders that which is subsequent in point of time, from <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> movement, even before it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in reality, in so far as it pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in an act of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: thus the end, which is subsequent in point of time, moves the agent in so far as it is apprehended and desired by him. On the other hand, what does not yet actually <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> movement if we consider the use of exterior things. Consequently, the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> cannot in point of time come into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> after <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> movement, as does the final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. It is therefore clear that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> do reasonably derive the power of justification from <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> righteousness; whereas the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> did not.

<p>Nevertheless the Fathers of old were justified by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, just as we are. And the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the old Law were a kind of protestation of that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, inasmuch as they signified <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> and its effects. It is therefore manifest that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> were not endowed with any power by which they conduced to the bestowal of justifying <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: and they merely signified <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by which men were justified.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The Fathers of old had <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the future <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion of Christ</a>, which, inasmuch as it was apprehended by the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, was able to justify them. But we have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the past <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion of Christ</a>, which is able to justify, also by the real use of sacramental things as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> That sanctification was but a figure: for they were said to be sanctified forasmuch as they gave themselves up to the Divine worship according to the rite of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, which was wholly ordained to the foreshadowing of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There have been many opinions about Circumcision. For, according to some, Circumcision conferred no <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but only remitted <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But this is impossible; because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not justified from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> save by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse24">Romans 3:24</a>: "Being justified freely by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>."

<p>Wherefore others said that by Circumcision <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is conferred, as to the privative effects of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but not as to its positive effects. But this also appears to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, because by Circumcision, children received the faculty of obtaining <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, which is the ultimate positive effect of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Moreover, as regards the order of the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">formal</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, positive effects are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> prior to privative effects, though according to the order of the material <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, the reverse is the case: for a form does not exclude privation save by informing the subject.

<p>Hence others say that Circumcision conferred <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> also as regards a certain positive effect, i.e. by making <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> worthy of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, but not so as to repress <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> which makes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> prone to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And so at one time it seemed to me. But if the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> be considered carefully, this too appears to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>; because the very least <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is sufficient to resist any degree of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>.

<p>And therefore it seems better to say that Circumcision was a sign of justifying <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse11">Romans 4:11</a>) that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> "received the sign of Circumcision, a seal of the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>." Consequently <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was conferred in Circumcision in so far as it was a sign of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> future <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, as will be made clear further on (70, 4).
