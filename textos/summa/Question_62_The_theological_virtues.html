<h1>Question 62. The theological virtues</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2062.htm#article1"> Are there any theological virtues?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2062.htm#article2"> Are the theological virtues distinct from the intellectual and moral virtues?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2062.htm#article3"> How many, and which are they?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2062.htm#article4"> Their order</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether there are any theological virtues?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there are not any theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For according to Phys. vii, text. 17, "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is the disposition of a perfect thing to that which is best: and by perfect, I mean that which is disposed according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." But that which is Divine is above <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of a man.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are quasi-Divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. But the Divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are exemplars, as stated above (Question 61, Article 5), which are not in us but in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are so called because they direct us to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is the first beginning and last end of all things. But by the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> and will, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is directed to his first beginning and last end. Therefore there is no need for any <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, to direct the reason and will to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> are about acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now the Divine Law contains precepts about the acts of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: for it is written (<a href="../bible/sir002.htm#verse8">Sirach 2:8, seqq.</a>): "Ye that fear the Lord <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him," and again, "hope in Him," and again, "love Him." Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> are <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> directing us to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore they are theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> is perfected by <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, for those actions whereby he is directed to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, as was explained above (Question 5, Article 7). Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is twofold, as was also stated above (Question 5, Article 5). One is proportionate to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, to wit, which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can obtain by means of his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> principles. The other is a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> surpassing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can obtain by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, by a kind of participation of the Godhead, about which it is written (<a href="../bible/2pe001.htm#verse4">2 Peter 1:4</a>) that by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> we are made "partakers of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." And because such <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> surpasses the capacity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> principles which enable him to act well according to his capacity, do not suffice to direct <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to this same <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Hence it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to receive from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> some additional principles, whereby he may be directed to <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, even as he is directed to his connatural end, by means of his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> principles, albeit not without Divine assistance. Such like principles are called "theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>": first, because their object is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, inasmuch as they direct us aright to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: secondly, because they are infused in us by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone: thirdly, because these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us, save by Divine <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>, contained in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A certain <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> may be ascribed to a certain thing in two ways. First, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>: and thus these theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> surpass the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Secondly, by participation, as kindled wood partakes of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of fire: and thus, after a fashion, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> becomes a partaker of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, as stated above: so that these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are proportionate to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in respect of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> of which he is made a partaker.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> These <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are called Divine, not as though <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> were <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> by reason of them, but because of them <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> makes us <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, and directs us to Himself. Hence they are not exemplar but exemplate <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The reason and will are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, inasmuch as He is the beginning and end of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but in proportion to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But the reason and will, according to their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, are not sufficiently directed to Him in so far as He is the object of <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the theological virtues are distinct from the intellectual and moral virtues?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not distinct from the moral and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, if they be in a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, must needs perfect it, either as to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a>, or as to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> part. Now the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which perfect the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> part are called <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which perfect the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> part, are called moral. Therefore, the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not distinct from the moral and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are those which direct us to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now, among the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> there is one which directs us to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: this is wisdom, which is about Divine things, since it considers the highest <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Therefore the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not distinct from the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Moribus Eccl. xv) shows how the four cardinal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are the "order of love." Now love is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which is a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not distinct from the theological.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> That which is above <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is distinct from that which is according to his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are above <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; while the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are in proportion to his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as clearly shown above (Question 58, Article 3). Therefore they are distinct from one another.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (54, 2, ad 1), <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are specifically distinct from one another in respect of the formal difference of their objects. Now the object of the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, Who is the last end of all, as surpassing the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of our reason. On the other hand, the object of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> is something comprehensible to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Wherefore the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are specifically distinct from the moral and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> perfect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> according to the capacity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, supernaturally.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The wisdom which the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vi, 3,7) reckons as an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, considers Divine things so far as they are open to the research of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, on the other hand, is about those same things so far as they surpass <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Though <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is love, yet love is not always <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. When, then, it is stated that every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is the order of love, this can be understood either of love in the general sense, or of the love of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. If it be understood of love, commonly so called, then each <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is stated to be the order of love, in so far as each cardinal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> requires ordinate emotions; and love is the root and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of every emotion, as stated above (27, 4; 28, 6, ad 2; 41, 2, ad 1). If, however, it be understood of the love of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, it does not mean that every other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>: but that all other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> depend on <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> in some way, as we shall show further on (65, A2,5; II-II, 23, 7).

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether faith, hope, and charity are fittingly reckoned as theological virtues?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> are not fittingly reckoned as three theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are in relation to Divine <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, what the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination is in relation to the connatural end. Now among the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> directed to the connatural end there is but one <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, viz. the understanding of principles. Therefore there should be but one theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are more perfect than the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not reckoned among the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, but is something less than a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since it is imperfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Likewise hope is not reckoned among the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, but is something less than a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since it is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>. Much less therefore should they be reckoned as theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> direct <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot be directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, save through the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> part, wherein are the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will. Therefore there should be only two theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, one perfecting the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, the other, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse13">1 Corinthians 13:13</a>): "Now there remain <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, these three."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> direct <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> in the same way as by the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is directed to his connatural end. Now the latter happens in respect of two things. First, in respect of the reason or <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, in so far as it contains the first universal principles which are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us by the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> light of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and which are reason's starting-point, both in speculative and in practical matters. Secondly, through the rectitude of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> which tends <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as defined by reason.

<p>But these two fall short of the order of <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse9">1 Corinthians 2:9</a>: "The eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, what things <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath prepared for them that love Him." Consequently in respect of both the above things <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needed to receive in addition something <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> to direct him to a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> end. First, as regards the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> receives certain <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> principles, which are held by means of a Divine light: these are the <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a>, about which is <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Secondly, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is directed to this end, both as to that end as something attainable--and this pertains to hope--and as to a certain <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> union, whereby the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is, so to speak, transformed into that end--and this belongs to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> of a thing is moved and tends towards its connatural end <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>; and this movement is due to a certain conformity of the thing with its end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> requires intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> whereby to understand: consequently there is need of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> in addition to the power. But the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> suffices for it to be directed <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> to the end, both as to the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the end and as to its conformity with the end. But the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the power is insufficient in either of these respects, for the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to be directed to things that are above its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Consequently there was need for an additional <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> in both respects.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> and hope imply a certain imperfection: since <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is of things unseen, and hope, of things not possessed. Hence <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope, in things that are subject to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> power, fall short of the notion of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope in things which are above the capacity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> surpass all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that is in proportion to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse25">1 Corinthians 1:25</a>: "The weakness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is stronger than men."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Two things pertain to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, viz. movement to the end, and conformity with the end by means of love. Hence there must needs be two theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, namely, hope and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether faith precedes hope, and hope charity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the order of the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> is not that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> precedes hope, and hope <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For the root precedes that which grows from it. Now <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is the root of all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, according to <a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse17">Ephesians 3:17</a>: "Being rooted and founded in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> precedes the others.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. i): "A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot love what he does not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>. But if he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> and loves, by doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works he ends in hoping." Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> precedes <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> hope.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, love is the principle of all our emotions, as stated above (2, ad 3). Now hope is a kind of emotion, since it is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, as stated above (Question 25, Article 2). Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which is love, precedes hope.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> enumerates them thus (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse13">1 Corinthians 13:13</a>): "Now there remain <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Order is twofold: order of generation, and order of perfection. By order of generation, in respect of which <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> precedes form, and the imperfect precedes the perfect, in one same subject <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> precedes hope, and hope <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as to their acts: because <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are all infused together. For the movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> cannot tend to anything, either by hoping or <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a>, unless that thing be apprehended by the sense or by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Now it is by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> apprehends the object of hope and love. Hence in the order of generation, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> precedes hope and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. In like manner a man loves a thing because he apprehends it as his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now from the very fact that a man hopes to be able to obtain some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> through someone, he looks on the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in whom he hopes as a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of his own. Hence for the very reason that a man hopes in someone, he proceeds to love him: so that in the order of generation, hope precedes <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> as regards their respective acts.

<p>But in the order of perfection, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> precedes <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope: because both <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope are quickened by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and receive from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> their full complement as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For thus <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is the mother and the root of all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, inasmuch as it is the form of them all, as we shall state further on (II-II, 23, 8).

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is speaking of that hope whereby a man hopes to obtain bliss through the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> which he has already: this belongs to hope quickened by and following <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. But it is possible for a man before having <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, to hope through <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> not already possessed, but which he hopes to possess.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (Question 40, Article 7), in treating of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, hope regards two things. One as its principal object, viz. the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> hoped for. With regard to this, love always precedes hope: for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is never hoped for unless it be desired and loved. Hope also regards the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> from whom a man hopes to be able to obtain some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. With regard to this, hope precedes love at first; though afterwards hope is increased by love. Because from the fact that a man thinks that he can obtain a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> through someone, he begins to love him: and from the fact that he loves him, he then hopes all the more in him.
