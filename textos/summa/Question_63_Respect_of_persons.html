<h1>Question 63. Respect of persons</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3063.htm#article1"> Is respect of persons a sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3063.htm#article2"> Does it take place in the dispensation of spiritualities?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3063.htm#article3"> Does it take place in showing honor?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3063.htm#article4"> Does it take place in judicial sentences?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether respect of persons is a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For the word "person" includes a reference to personal dignity [Cf. I, 29, 3, ad 2]. Now it belongs to distributive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to consider personal dignity. Therefore respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are of more importance than things, since things are for the benefit of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and not conversely.

<p>But respect of things is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Much less, therefore, is respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> or <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Yet <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> seems to respect <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, since of two men circumstanced alike He sometimes upraises one by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and leaves the other in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse40">Matthew 24:40</a>: "Two shall be in a bed [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'field' ['Bed' is the reading of <a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse34">Luke 17:34</a>], one shall be taken, and one shall be left." Therefore respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Nothing but <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is forbidden in the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>. Now respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is forbidden, <a href="../bible/deu001.htm#verse17">Deuteronomy 1:17</a>: "Neither shall you respect any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>." Therefore respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is opposed to distributive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. For the equality of distributive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> consists in allotting various things to various <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in proportion to their personal dignity. Accordingly, if one considers that personal property by reason of which the thing allotted to a particular <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is due to him, this is respect not of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> but of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Hence a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse9">Ephesians 6:9</a>, "There is no respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Him']," says that "a just judge regards <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, not <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>." For instance if you promote a man to a professorship on account of his having sufficient <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, you consider the due <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, not the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; but if, in conferring something on someone, you consider in him not the fact that what you give him is proportionate or due to him, but the fact that he is this particular <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> (e.g. Peter or Martin), then there is respect of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, since you give him something not for some <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that renders him worthy of it, but simply because he is this <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. And any circumstance that does not amount to a reason why this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be worthy of this <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, is to be referred to his <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>: for instance if a man promote someone to a prelacy or a professorship, because he is rich or because he is a relative of his, it is respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. It may happen, however, that a circumstance of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> makes a man worthy as regards one thing, but not as regards another: thus <a href="../cathen/04264a.htm">consanguinity</a> makes a man worthy to be appointed heir to an estate, but not to be chosen for a position of ecclesiastical authority: wherefore consideration of the same circumstance of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> will amount to respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in one <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and not in another. It follows, accordingly, that respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is opposed to distributive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> in that it fails to observe due proportion. Now nothing but <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is opposed to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: and therefore respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In distributive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> we consider those circumstances of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> which result in dignity or right, whereas in respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> we consider circumstances that do not so result.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Persons are rendered proportionate to and worthy of things which are distributed among them, by reason of certain things pertaining to circumstances of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, wherefore such <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> ought to be considered as the proper <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But when we consider the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> themselves, that which is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is considered as though it were; and so it is clear that although <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are more worthy, absolutely speaking, yet they are not more worthy in this regard.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There is a twofold giving. one belongs to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and occurs when we give a man his due: in such like givings respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> takes place. The other giving belongs to liberality, when one gives gratis that which is not a man's due: such is the bestowal of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, whereby sinners are chosen by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. On such a giving there is no place for respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, because anyone may, without <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, give of his own as much as he will, and to whom he will, according to <a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse14">Matthew 20:14-15</a>, "Is it not lawful for me to do what I will? . . . Take what is thine, and go thy way."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether respect of persons takes place in the dispensation of spiritual goods?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> does not take place in the dispensation of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods. For it would seem to savor of respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> if a man confers ecclesiastical dignity or benefice on account of <a href="../cathen/04264a.htm">consanguinity</a>, since <a href="../cathen/04264a.htm">consanguinity</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> whereby a man is rendered worthy of an <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefice</a>. Yet this apparently is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for ecclesiastical <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> are wont to do so. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> does not take place in the conferring of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to give preference to a rich <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> rather than to a poor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> seems to pertain to respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, according to <a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse2">James 2:2-3</a>. Nevertheless dispensations to marry within forbidden degrees are more readily granted to the rich and powerful than to others. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> seems not to take place in the dispensation of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to jurists [Cap. Cum dilectus.] it suffices to choose a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and it is not requisite that one choose the better <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But it would seem to savor of respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to choose one who is less <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for a higher position. Therefore respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> matters.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (Cap. Cum dilectus.) the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to be chosen should be "a member of the flock." Now this would seem to imply respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, since sometimes more competent <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> would be found elsewhere. Therefore respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> matters.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse1">James 2:1</a>): "Have not the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> . . . with respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>." On these words a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says: "Who is there that would tolerate the promotion of a rich <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to a position of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to the exclusion of a poor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> more learned and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holier</a>?" [<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, Ep. ad Hieron. clxvii.]

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in so far as it is contrary to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Now the graver the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in which <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is transgressed, the more grievous the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: so that, <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things being of greater import than temporal, respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in dispensing spiritualities than in dispensing temporalities. And since it is respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> when something is allotted to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> out of proportion to his deserts, it must be observed that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> worthiness may be considered in two ways. First, simply and absolutely: and in this way the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who abounds the more in the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is the more worthy. Secondly, in relation to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; for it happens at times that the less <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and less learned <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may conduce more to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, on account of worldly authority or activity, or something of the kind. And since the dispensation of spiritualities is directed chiefly to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse7">1 Corinthians 12:7</a>, "The manifestation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> is given to every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> unto profit," it follows that in the dispensation of spiritualities the simply less <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> are sometimes preferred to the better, without respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, just as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sometimes bestows gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> on the less worthy.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> We must make a distinction with regard to a prelate's <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">kinsfolk</a>: for sometimes they are less worthy, both absolutely speaking, and in relation to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: and then if they are preferred to the more worthy, there is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in the dispensation of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods, whereof the ecclesiastical superior is not the owner, with power to give them away as he will, but the dispenser, according to <a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse1">1 Corinthians 4:1</a>, "Let a man so account of us as of the ministers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the dispensers of the mysteries of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Sometimes however the prelate's <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">kinsfolk</a> are as worthy as others, and then without respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> he can lawfully give preference to his kindred since there is at least this advantage, that he can trust the more in their being of one mind with him in conducting the business of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Yet he would have to forego so doing for fear of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, if anyone might take an example from him and give the goods of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to their kindred without regard to their deserts.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Dispensations for contracting marriage came into use for the purpose of strengthening treaties of peace: and this is more <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in relation to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of standing, so that there is no respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in granting dispensations more readily to such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In order that an election be not rebutted in a court of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, it suffices to elect a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, nor is it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to elect the better <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, because otherwise every election might have a flaw. But as regards the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> of an elector, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to elect one who is better, either absolutely speaking, or in relation to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. For if it is possible to have one who is more competent for a post, and yet another be preferred, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to have some <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for this. If this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> have anything to do with the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in point, he who is elected will, in this respect, be more competent; and if that which is taken for <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> have nothing to do with the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, it will clearly be respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who is taken from among the members of a particular Church, is generally speaking more useful as regards the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since he loves more the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> wherein he was brought up. For this reason it was commanded (<a href="../bible/deu017.htm#verse15">Deuteronomy 17:15</a>): "Thou mayest not make a man of another nation king, who is not thy brother."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether respect of persons takes place in showing honor and respect?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> does not take place in showing <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and respect. For <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is apparently nothing else than "reverence shown to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in recognition of his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. i, 5). Now <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and princes should be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> although they be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, even as our parents, of whom it is written (<a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse12">Exodus 20:12</a>): "Honor thy father and thy mother." Again masters, though they be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, should be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> by their servants, according to <a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse1">1 Timothy 6:1</a>: "Whoever are servants under the yoke, let them count their masters worthy of all <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>." Therefore it seems that it is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to respect <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in showing <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is commanded (<a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse32">Leviticus 19:32</a>): "Rise up before the hoary head, and, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the aged <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." But this seems to savor of respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, since sometimes old men are not <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>; according to <a href="../bible/dan013.htm#verse5">Daniel 13:5</a>: "Iniquity came out from the ancients of the people [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Iniquity came out of Babylon from the ancient judges, that seemed to govern the people.']." Therefore it is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to respect <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in showing <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, on the words of <a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse1">James 2:1</a>, "Have not the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> . . . with respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>," a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [Ep. ad Hieron. clxvii.] says: "If the saying of James, 'If there shall come into your assembly a man having a golden <a href="../cathen/13059a.htm">ring</a>,' etc., refer to our daily meetings, who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not here, if however he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> at all?" Yet it is respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> the rich for their <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, for <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says in a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> (xxviii in Evang.): "Our <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is blunted, since in men we <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, not the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> wherein they are made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> image, but <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>," so that, <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> not being a due <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, this will savor of respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Therefore it is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to respect <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in showing <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse1">James 2:1</a>, says: "Whoever honors the rich for their <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>," and in like manner, if a man be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> for other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> that do not render him worthy of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. Now this savors of respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Therefore it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to respect <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in showing <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> To <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is to recognize him as having <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, wherefore <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> alone is the due <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> being <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>. Now it is to be observed that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> may be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> not only for his own <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but also for another's: thus princes and <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, although they be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> as standing in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> place, and as representing the community over which they are placed, according to <a href="../bible/pro026.htm#verse8">Proverbs 26:8</a>, "As he that casteth a stone into the heap of Mercury, so is he that giveth <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to a fool." For, since the gentiles ascribed the keeping of accounts to Mercury, "the heap of Mercury" signifies the casting up of an account, when a merchant sometimes substitutes a pebble ['Lapillus' or 'calculus' whence the English word 'calculate'] for one hundred marks. So too, is a fool <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> if he stand in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> place or represent the whole community: and in the same way parents and masters should be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>, on account of their having a share of the dignity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who is the Father and Lord of all. The aged should be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>, because old age is a sign of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, though this sign fail at times: wherefore, according to <a href="../bible/wis004.htm#verse8">Wisdom 4:8-9</a>, "venerable old age is not that of long time, nor counted by the number of years; but the understanding of a man is gray hairs, and a spotless life is old age." The rich ought to be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> by reason of their occupying a higher position in the community: but if they be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> merely for their <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, it will be the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.

<p>Hence the Replies to the Objections are clear.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the sin of respect of persons takes place in judicial sentences?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> does not take place in judicial sentences. For respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is opposed to distributive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>): whereas judicial sentences seem to pertain chiefly to commutative <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Therefore respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> does not take place in judicial sentences.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, penalties are inflicted according to a sentence. Now it is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to respect <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in pronouncing penalties, since a heavier punishment is inflicted on one who injures the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of a prince than on one who injures the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of others. Therefore respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> does not take place in judicial sentences.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/sir004.htm#verse10">Sirach 4:10</a>): "In judging be merciful to the fatherless." But this seems to imply respect of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the needy. Therefore in judicial sentences respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/pro018.htm#verse5">Proverbs 18:5</a>): "It is not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to accept the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in judgment [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'It is not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to accept the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, to decline from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of judgment.']."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 60, Article 1), judgment is an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, in as much as the judge restores to the equality of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, those things which may <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> an opposite inequality. Now respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> involves a certain inequality, in so far as something is allotted to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> out of that proportion to him in which the equality of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> consists. Wherefore it is evident that judgment is rendered corrupt by respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A judgment may be looked at in two ways. First, in view of the thing judged, and in this way judgment is common to commutative and distributive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: because it may be decided by judgment how some common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is to be distributed among many, and how one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is to restore to another what he has taken from him. Secondly, it may be considered in view of the form of judgment, in as much as, even in commutative <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, the judge takes from one and gives to another, and this belongs to distributive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. On this way respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> may take place in any judgment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is more severely punished on account of a crime committed against a greater <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, there is no respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, because the very difference of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, in that case, a diversity of things, as stated above (58, 10, ad 3; 61, 2, ad 3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In pronouncing judgment one ought to succor the needy as far as possible, yet without prejudice to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: else the saying of <a href="../bible/exo023.htm#verse3">Exodus 23:3</a> would apply: "Neither shalt thou favor a poor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in judgment."
