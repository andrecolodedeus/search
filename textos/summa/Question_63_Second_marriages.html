<h1>Question 63. Second marriages</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5063.htm#article1"> Is it lawful?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5063.htm#article2"> Is it a sacrament?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether a second marriage is lawful?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">second marriage</a> is unlawful. Because we should judge of things according to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> [Hom. xxxii in the Opus Imperfectum <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>] says that "to take a second husband is in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> fornication," which is unlawful. Therefore neither is a <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">second marriage</a> lawful.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever is not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is unlawful. Now <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> [On <a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse40">1 Corinthians 7:40</a> and De Viduis] says that a <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">second marriage</a> is not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore it is unlawful.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no one should be debarred from being present at such things as are becoming and lawful. Yet <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are debarred from being present at second marriages, as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 42). Therefore they are unlawful.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, no one incurs a penalty save for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> incurs the penalty of <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a> on account of being <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> twice. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">second marriage</a> is unlawful.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> We read of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> having contracted a <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">second marriage</a> (<a href="../bible/gen025.htm#verse1">Genesis 25:1</a>).

<p>Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse14">1 Timothy 5:14</a>): "I will . . . that the younger," namely <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, "should marry, bear children." Therefore second marriages are lawful.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The marriage tie lasts only until death (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse2">Romans 7:2</a>), wherefore at the death of either spouse the marriage tie ceases: and consequently when one dies the other is not hindered from marrying a second time on account of the previous marriage. Therefore not only second marriages are lawful, but even third and so on.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> is speaking in reference to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> which is wont at times to incite a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to a <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">second marriage</a>, namely <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> which incites also to fornication.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">second marriage</a> is stated not to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, not that it is unlawful, but because it lacks the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of the signification which is in a first marriage, where one husband has one wife, as in the case of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Men who are <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to Divine things are debarred not only from unlawful things, but even from things which have any appearance of turpitude; and consequently they are debarred from second marriages, which lack the decorum which was in a first marriage.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">Irregularity</a> is not always incurred on account of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and may be incurred through a defect in a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> ["Defectus sacramenti," i.e. defect of signification; Cf. 2, Objection 3]. Hence the argument is not to the point.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether a second marriage is a sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">second marriage</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. For he who repeats a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> injures the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. But no sacrament should be done an injury. Therefore if a <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">second marriage</a> were a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, marriage ought nowise to be repeated.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in every sacrament some kind of <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> is given. But no <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> is given in a <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">second marriage</a>, as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 42). Therefore no sacrament is conferred therein.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, signification is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. But the signification of marriage is not preserved in a <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">second marriage</a>, because there is not a union of only one <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> with only one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as in the case of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Therefore it is not a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, one sacrament is not an impediment to receiving another. But a <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">second marriage</a> is an impediment to receiving orders. Therefore it is not a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Marital intercourse is excused from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in a <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">second marriage</a> even as in a first marriage. Now marital intercourse is excused [Cf. 69, 1 by the marriage goods which are fidelity, offspring, and sacrament. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">second marriage</a> is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a> is not contracted through a second and non-sacramental union, such as fornication. Yet <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a> is contracted through a <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">second marriage</a>. Therefore it is a sacramental union.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Wherever we find the essentials of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, there is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sacrament. Wherefore, since in a <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">second marriage</a> we find all the essentials of the sacrament of marriage (namely the due <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>--which results from the parties having the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> prescribed by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>--and the due form, which is the expression of the inward consent by words of the present), it is clear that a <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">second marriage</a> is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> even as a first.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> an everlasting effect: for then, if the sacrament be repeated, it is implied that the first was not effective, and thus an injury is done to the first, as is clear in all those <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which imprint a character. But those <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which have not an everlasting effect can be repeated without injury to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as in the case of Penance. And, since the marriage tie ceases with death, no injury is done to the sacrament if a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> marry again after her husband's death.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">second marriage</a>, considered in itself, is a perfect sacrament, yet if we consider it in relation to the first marriage, it is somewhat a defective sacrament, because it has not its full signification, since there is not a union of only one <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> with only one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as in the marriage of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. And on account of this defect the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> is omitted in a <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">second marriage</a>. This, however, refers to the case when it is a <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">second marriage</a> on the part of both <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, or on the part of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> only. For if a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> marry a man who has had another wife, the marriage is blessed nevertheless. Because the signification is preserved to a certain extent even in relation to the former marriage, since though <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has but one <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for His spouse, there are many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> espoused to Him in the one <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot be espoused to another besides <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, else it commits fornication with the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Nor is there a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> marriage. For this reason when a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> marries a second time the marriage is not blessed on account of the defect in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The perfect signification is found in a <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">second marriage</a> considered in itself, not however if it be considered in relation to the previous marriage, and it is thus that it is a defective sacrament.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">second marriage</a> in so far as there is a defect in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but not as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, is an impediment to the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacrament of Order</a>.
