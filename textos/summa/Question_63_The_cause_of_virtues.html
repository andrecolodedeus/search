<h1>Question 63. The cause of virtues</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2063.htm#article1"> Is virtue in us by nature?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2063.htm#article2"> Is any virtue caused in us by habituation?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2063.htm#article3"> Are any moral virtues in us by infusion?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2063.htm#article4"> Is virtue acquired by habituation, of the same species as infused virtue?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether virtue is in us by nature?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is in us by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 14): "Virtues are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to us and are equally in all of us." And Antony says in his sermon to the monks: "If the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> contradicts <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> it is perverse, if it follow <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> it is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>." Moreover, a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse23">Matthew 4:23</a>, "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> went about," etc., says: "He taught them <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, i.e. <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> possesses <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> consists in accord with reason, as was clearly shown above (55, 4, ad 2). But that which accords with reason is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; since reason is part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that which is in us from birth is said to be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to us. Now <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are in some from birth: for it is written (<a href="../bible/job031.htm#verse18">Job 31:18</a>): "From my infancy mercy grew up with me; and it came out with me from my mother's womb." Therefore <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Whatever is in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is common to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and is not taken away by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, since even in the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> remain, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> states (Div. Nom. iv). But <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not in all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; and is cast out by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore it is not in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> With regard to corporeal forms, it has been maintained by some that they are wholly from within, by those, for instance, who upheld the theory of "latent forms" [Anaxagoras; Cf. I, 45, 8; 65, 4]. Others held that forms are entirely from without, those, for instance, who thought that corporeal forms originated from some separate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Others, however, esteemed that they are partly from within, in so far as they pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a> in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; and partly from without, in so far as they are brought into act by the agent.

<p>In like manner with regard to <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, some held that they are wholly from within, so that all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> would pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, but that the hindrances to science and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which are due to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> being weighed down by the body, are removed by study and practice, even as iron is made bright by being polished. This was the opinion of the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a>. Others said that they are wholly from without, being due to the inflow of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a> maintained. Others said that <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are within us by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, so far as we are adapted to them, but not in their perfection: this is the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. ii, 1), and is nearer the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p>To make this clear, it must be observed that there are two ways in which something is said to be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to a man; one is according to his specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the other according to his <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. And, since each thing derives its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, and its individuation from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and, again, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> form is his rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, while his <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is his body, whatever belongs to him in respect of his rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to him in respect of his specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; while whatever belongs to him in respect of the particular temperament of his body, is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to him in respect of his <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For whatever is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in respect of his body, considered as part of his <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, is to be referred, in a way, to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in so far as this particular body is adapted to this particular <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p>In both these ways <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> inchoatively. This is so in respect of the specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, in so far as in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> reason are to be found instilled by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> certain <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> principles of both <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and action, which are the nurseries of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and in so far as there is in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in accordance with reason. Again, this is so in respect of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, in so far as by reason of a disposition in the body, some are disposed either well or ill to certain <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: because, to wit, certain sensitive powers are acts of certain parts of the body, according to the disposition of which these powers are helped or hindered in the exercise of their acts, and, in consequence, the rational powers also, which the aforesaid sensitive powers assist. In this way one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> aptitude for science, another for <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, another for <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>: and in these ways, both <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are in us by way of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> aptitude, inchoatively, but not perfectly, since <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is determined to one, while the perfection of these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> does not depend on one particular mode of action, but on various modes, in respect of the various matters, which constitute the sphere of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue's</a> action, and according to various circumstances.

<p>It is therefore evident that all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are in us by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, according to aptitude and inchoation, but not according to perfection, except the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, which are entirely from without.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections. For the first two argue about the nurseries of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which are in us by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, inasmuch as we are rational beings. The third objection must be taken in the sense that, owing to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> disposition which the body has from birth, one has an aptitude for pity, another for living temperately, another for some other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether any virtue is caused in us by habituation?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> can not be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in us by habituation. Because a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [Cf. Lib. Sentent. Prosperi cvi.] <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse23">Romans 14:23</a>, "All that is not of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>," says: "The whole life of an unbeliever is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and there is no <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> without the Sovereign Good. Where <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is lacking, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a mockery even in the best behaved people." Now <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> cannot be acquired by means of works, but is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in us by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse8">Ephesians 2:8</a>: "By <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> you are saved through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>." Therefore no acquired <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> can be in us by habituation.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are contraries, so that they are incompatible. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot avoid <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> except by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/wis008.htm#verse21">Wisdom 8:21</a>: "I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that I could not otherwise be continent, except <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave it." Therefore neither can any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in us by habituation, but only by the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, actions which lead toward <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, lack the perfection of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But an effect cannot be more perfect than its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by actions that precede it.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is more efficacious than <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> acts. Much more, therefore, can <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> acts.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We have spoken above (51, A2,3) in a general way about the production of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> from acts; and speaking now in a special way of this matter in relation to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, we must take note that, as stated above (55, A3,4), <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> perfects him in relation to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now since the notion of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> consists in "mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and order," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Nat. Boni. iii) or in "number, weight, and measure," as expressed in <a href="../bible/wis011.htm#verse21">Wisdom 11:21</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> must needs be appraised with respect to some rule. Now this rule is twofold, as stated above (19, A3,4), viz. <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> and Divine Law. And since Divine Law is the higher rule, it extends to more things, so that whatever is ruled by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, is ruled by the Divine Law too; but the converse does not hold.

<p>It follows that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> directed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is defined according to the rule of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> can be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>: inasmuch as such acts proceed from reason, by whose power and rule the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is established. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which directs <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as defined by the Divine Law, and not by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, cannot be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, the principle of which is reason, but is produced in us by the Divine operation alone. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> in giving the definition of the latter <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> inserts the words, "which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> works in us without us" (Super Ps. 118, Serm. xxvi). It is also of these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> that the First Objection holds good.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is incompatible with divinely infused <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, especially if this be considered in its perfect state. But actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, even mortal, is compatible with humanly acquired <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; because the use of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> in us is subject to our will, as stated above (Question 49, Article 3): and one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act does not destroy a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of acquired <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since it is not an act but a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, that is directly contrary to a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. Wherefore, though <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot avoid mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, so as never to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> mortally, yet he is not hindered from acquiring a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, whereby he may abstain from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the majority of cases, and chiefly in matters most opposed to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. There are also certain mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can nowise avoid without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, those, namely, which are directly opposed to the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, which are in us through the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. This, however, will be more fully explained later (109, 4).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (1; 51, 1), certain seeds or principles of acquired <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in us by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. These principles are more excellent than the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> acquired through them: thus the understanding of speculative principles is more excellent than the science of conclusions, and the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> rectitude of the reason is more excellent than the rectification of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> which results through the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> partaking of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, which rectification belongs to moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Accordingly <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, in so far as they proceed from higher principles, can <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> acquired <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether any moral virtues are in us by infusion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> besides the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are infused in us by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not do by Himself, save perhaps sometimes <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a>, those things that can be done by second <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>; for, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. iv), "it is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> rule to bring about extremes through the mean." Now <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> can be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in us by our acts, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Therefore it is not reasonable that they should be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in us by infusion.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, much less superfluity is found in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> works than in the works of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> suffice to direct us to <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore there are no other <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> needing to be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in us by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> does not employ two means where one suffices: much less does <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sowed the seeds of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/heb001.htm">Hebrews 1</a> [Cf. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> on <a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse15">Galatians 1:15-16</a>]. Therefore it is unfitting for Him to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> in us other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> by means of infusion.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/wis008.htm#verse7">Wisdom 8:7</a>): "She teacheth <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Effects must needs be proportionate to their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> and principles. Now all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and moral, that are acquired by our actions, arise from certain <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> principles pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in us, as above stated (1; 51, 1): instead of which <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> principles, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> bestows on us the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, whereby we are directed to a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> end, as stated (62, 1). Wherefore we need to receive from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> other <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> corresponding, in due proportion, to the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, which <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are to the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, what the moral and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> principles of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Some moral and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> can indeed be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in us by our actions: but such are not proportionate to the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Therefore it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for us to receive, from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> immediately, others that are proportionate to these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> direct us sufficiently to our <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> end, inchoatively: i.e. to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself immediately. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> needs further to be perfected by infused <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in regard to other things, yet in relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The power of those <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> instilled principles does not extend beyond the capacity of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Consequently <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs in addition to be perfected by other principles in relation to his <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> end.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether virtue by habituation belongs to the same species as infused virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that infused <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> does not differ in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from acquired <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Because acquired and infused <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, according to what has been said (3), do not differ seemingly, save in relation to the last end. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> and acts are specified, not by their last, but by their proximate end. Therefore the infused moral or <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> does not differ from the acquired <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by their acts. But the act of infused and acquired <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is the same, viz. to moderate desires of touch. Therefore they do not differ in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, acquired and infused <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> differ as that which is wrought by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> immediately, from that which is wrought by a creature. But the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made, is of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> as a man begotten <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>; and the eye which He gave to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> born blind, as one produced by the power of generation. Therefore it seems that acquired and infused <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> belong to the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Any change introduced into the difference expressed in a definition involves a difference of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But the definition of infused <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> contains the words, "which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> works in us without us," as stated above (Question 55, Article 4). Therefore acquired <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, to which these words cannot apply, is not of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> as infused <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There is a twofold specific difference among <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>. The first, as stated above (54, 2; 56, 2; 60, 1), is taken from the specific and formal aspects of their objects. Now the object of every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> considered as in that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue's</a> proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: thus the object of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in respect of the pleasures connected with the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of touch. The formal aspect of this object is from reason which fixes the mean in these <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a>: while the material element is something on the part of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a>. Now it is evident that the mean that is appointed in such like <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a> according to the rule of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, is seen under a different aspect from the mean which is fixed according to Divine rule. For instance, in the consumption of food, the mean fixed by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, is that food should not harm the health of the body, nor hinder the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>: whereas, according to the Divine rule, it behooves <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to "chastise his body, and bring it into subjection" (<a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse27">1 Corinthians 9:27</a>), by abstinence in food, drink and the like. It is therefore evident that infused and acquired <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> differ in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; and the same applies to the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p>The other specific differences among <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> is taken from the things to which they are directed: for a man's health and a horse's are not of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, on account of the difference between the natures to which their respective healths are directed. In the same sense, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Polit. iii, 3) that citizens have diverse <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> according as they are well directed to diverse forms of government. In the same way, too, those infused moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, whereby men behave well in respect of their being "fellow-citizens with the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and of the household [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'domestics'] of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse19">Ephesians 2:19</a>), differ from the acquired <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> behaves well in respect of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Infused and acquired <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> differ not only in relation to the ultimate end, but also in relation to their proper objects, as stated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Both acquired and infused <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> moderate desires for pleasures of touch, but for different reasons, as stated: wherefore their respective acts are not identical.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> born blind an eye for the same act as the act for which other eyes are formed <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>: consequently it was of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. It would be the same if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wished to give a man <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, such as those that are acquired by acts. But the case is not so in the question before us, as stated.
