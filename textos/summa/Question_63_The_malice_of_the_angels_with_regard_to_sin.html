<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the evil of fault can be in the angels?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there can be no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of fault in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For there can be no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> except in things which are in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, as is said by the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. ix, text. 19), because the subject of privation is a being in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have not being in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, since they are subsisting forms. Therefore there can be no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in them.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are higher than the heavenly bodies. But <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> say that there cannot be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the heavenly bodies. Therefore neither can there by in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, what is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to a thing is always in it. But it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> for the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to be moved by the movement of love towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore such love cannot be withdrawn from them. But in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> they do not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, desire is only of what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or apparently <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now for the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> there can be no apparent <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is not a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; because in them either there can be no <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> at all, or at least not before guilt. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> can desire only what it <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But no one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by desiring what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by desire.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/job004.htm#verse18">Job 4:18</a>): "In His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> He found <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> An <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> or any other rational creature considered in his own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, can <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and to whatever creature it belongs not to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, such creature has it as a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and not from the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. The reason of this is, because <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> is nothing else than a deviation from that rectitude which an act ought to have; whether we speak of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, art, or morals. That act alone, the rule of which is the very <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the agent, can never fall short of rectitude. Were the craftsman's hand the rule itself engraving, he could not engrave the wood otherwise than rightly; but if the rightness of engraving be judged by another rule, then the engraving may be right or faulty. Now the Divine <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the sole rule of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> act, because it is not referred to any higher end. But every <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> will has rectitude of act so far only as it is regulated according to the Divine will, to which the last end is to be referred: as every desire of a subordinate ought to be regulated by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of his superior; for instance, the soldier's will, according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of his commanding officer. Thus only in the Divine will can there be no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; whereas there can be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of every creature; considering the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> there is no <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. Yet there is <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> in their <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> part, as regards their being inclined to this or the other object. In this respect there can be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The heavenly bodies have none but a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> operation. Therefore as there can be no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of corruption in their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; so neither can there be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of disorder in their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> action. But besides their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> action there is the action of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, by reason of which <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> may be in them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> for the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to turn to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the movement of love, according as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the principle of his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> being. But for him to turn to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the object of <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> beatitude, comes of infused love, from which he could be turned away by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> occurs in two ways in the act of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>.

<p>First, when something <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is chosen; as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by choosing <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of itself. Such <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> always comes of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; otherwise what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> would never be chosen as <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. The adulterer <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errs</a> in the particular, choosing this delight of an inordinate act as something <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to be performed now, from the inclination of passion or of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>; even though he does not <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> in his universal judgment, but retains a right opinion in this respect. In this way there can be no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>; because there are no <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to fetter reason or <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as is manifest from what has been said above (Question 59, Article 4); nor, again, could any <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> inclining to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> precede their first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. In another way <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> comes of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> by choosing something <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in itself, but not according to proper measure or rule; so that the defect which induces <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is only on the part of the choice which is not properly regulated, but not on the part of the thing chosen; as if one were to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, without heeding the order established by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Such a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not presuppose <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, but merely absence of consideration of the things which ought to be considered. In this way the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, by seeking his own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, from his own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, insubordinately to the rule of the Divine will.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether only the sin of pride and envy can exist in an angel?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there can be other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> besides those of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>. Because whosoever can delight in any kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, can fall into the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> itself. But the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> delight even in the obscenities of carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 3). Therefore there can also be carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> are <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, so are sloth, avarice, and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. But <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are concerned with the spirit, just as carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are with the flesh. Therefore not only can there be <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; but likewise sloth and avarice.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi), many <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> spring from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>; and in like manner from <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>. But, if the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is granted, the effect follows. If, therefore, there can be <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, for the same reason there can likewise be other <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> in them.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 3) that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> "is not a fornicator nor a drunkard, nor anything of the like sort; yet he is <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Sin can <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in a subject in two ways: first of all by actual guilt, and secondly by affection. As to guilt, all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are in the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; since by leading men to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> they incur the guilt of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But as to affection only those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> can be in the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> which can belong to a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> cannot be affected by such pleasures as appertain to bodies, but only by such as are in keeping with <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things; because nothing is affected except with regard to something which is in some way suited to its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But there can be no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> when anyone is incited to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> order; unless in such affection the rule of the superior be not kept. Such is precisely the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>--not to be subject to a superior when subjection is due. Consequently the first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can be none other than <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>.

<p>Yet, as a consequence, it was possible for <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> also to be in them, since for the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> to tend to the desire of something involves on its part resistance to anything contrary. Now the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> repines over the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> possessed by another, inasmuch as he deems his neighbor's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to be a hindrance to his own. But another's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> could not be deemed a hindrance to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, except inasmuch as he <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> a singular excellence, which would cease to be singular because of the excellence of some other. So, after the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, there followed the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, whereby he grieved over <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and also over the Divine excellence, according as against the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> will <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> makes use of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for the Divine <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> do not delight in the obscenities of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the flesh, as if they themselves were disposed to carnal pleasures: it is wholly through <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> that they take pleasure in all sorts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, so far as these are hindrances to a man's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Avarice, considered as a special kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is the immoderate greed of temporal possessions which serve the use of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, and which can be estimated in value of money; to these <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are not at all inclined, any more than they are to carnal pleasures. Consequently avarice properly so called cannot be in them. But if every immoderate greed of possessing any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> be termed avarice, in this way avarice is contained under the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> which is in the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. Anger implies passion, and so does <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>; consequently they can only <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> metaphorically in the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. Sloth is a kind of sadness, whereby a man becomes sluggish in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> exercises because they weary the body; which does not apply to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. So it is evident that <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> are the only <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which can be found in <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; yet so that <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is not to be taken for a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, but for a will resisting the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Under <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, as found in the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, are comprised all other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> derived from them.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the devil desired to be as God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> did not desire to be as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For what does not fall under apprehension, does not fall under desire; because the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is apprehended moves the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, whether sensible, rational, or <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>; and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> consists only in such desire. But for any creature to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> equal does not fall under apprehension, because it implies a contradiction; for if the finite equals the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, then it would itself be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. Therefore an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> could not desire to be as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> end can always be desired without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But to be likened unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the end to which every creature <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> tends. If, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> desired to be as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not by equality, but by likeness, it would seem that he did not thereby <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> with greater fulness of wisdom than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, save a fool, ever makes choice of being the equal of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, still less of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; because choice regards only things which are possible, regarding which one takes deliberation. Therefore much less did the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by desiring to be as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said, in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> (<a href="../bible/isa014.htm#verse13">Isaiah 14:13-14</a>), "I will ascend into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> . . . I will be like the Most High." And <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Qu. Vet. Test. cxiii) says that being "inflated with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, he wished to be called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> by seeking to be as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But this can be understood in two ways: first, by equality; secondly, by likeness. He could not seek to be as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the first way; because by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that this was impossible: and there was no <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> preceding his first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act, nor any passion fettering his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, so as to lead him to choose what was impossible by failing in some particular; as sometimes happens in ourselves. And even supposing it were possible, it would be against the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> desire; because there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in everything the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> desire of preserving its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; which would not be preserved were it to be changed into another <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Consequently, no creature of a lower order can ever covet the grade of a higher <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; just as an ass does not desire to be a horse: for were it to be so upraised, it would cease to be itself. But herein the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> plays us <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>; for one is liable to think that, because a man seeks to occupy a higher grade as to <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentals</a>, which can increase without the destruction of the subject, he can also seek a higher grade of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, to which he could not attain without ceasing to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>. Now it is quite evident that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> surpasses the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, not merely in <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentals</a>, but also in degree of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, another. Consequently it is impossible for one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of lower degree to desire equality with a higher; and still more to covet equality with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>To desire to be as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> according to likeness can happen in two ways. In one way, as to that likeness whereby everything is made to be likened unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And so, if anyone desire in this way to be Godlike, he commits no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; provided that he desires such likeness in proper order, that is to say, that he may obtain it of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But he would <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> were he to desire to be like unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> even in the right way, as of his own, and not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> power. In another way one may desire to be like unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in some respect which is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to one; as if one were to desire to create <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth, which is proper to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; in which desire there would be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. It was in this way that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> desired to be as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Not that he desired to resemble <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by being subject to no one else absolutely; for so he would be desiring his own 'not-being'; since no creature can <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> except by holding its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> under <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But he desired resemblance with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in this respect--by desiring, as his last end of beatitude, something which he could attain by the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of his own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, turning his <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> away from <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> beatitude, which is attained by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Or, if he desired as his last end that likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> which is bestowed by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, he sought to have it by the power of his own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and not from Divine assistance according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> ordering. This harmonizes with <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm's</a> opinion, who says [De casu diaboli, iv.] that "he sought that to which he would have come had he stood fast." These two views in a manner coincide; because according to both, he sought to have final beatitude of his own power, whereas this is proper to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone.

<p>Since, then, what <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> of itself is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of what <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> of another, it follows from this furthermore that he sought to have dominion over others; wherein he also perversely wished to be like unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>From this we have the answer to all the objections.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether any demons are naturally wicked?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that some <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. For Porphyry says, as quoted by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei x, 11): "There is a class of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> of crafty <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, pretending that they are gods and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the dead." But to be deceitful is to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore some <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so are men. But some men are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, of whom it is said (<a href="../bible/wis012.htm#verse10">Wisdom 12:10</a>): "Their <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>." Therefore some <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> may be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, some irrational animals have <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> dispositions by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: thus the fox is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> sly, and the wolf <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> rapacious; yet they are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> creatures. Therefore, although the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> creatures, they may be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that "the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Everything which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>, so far as it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> and has a particular <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, tends <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> towards some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; since it comes from a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> principle; because the effect always reverts to its principle. Now a particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> may happen to have some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> connected with it; thus fire has this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> connected with it that it consumes other things: but with the universal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> can be connected. If, then, there be anything whose <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is inclined towards some particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it can tend <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> to some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; not as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, as connected with some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But if anything of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> be inclined to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in general, then of its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> it cannot be inclined to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Now it is manifest that every <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is inclined towards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in general, which it can apprehend and which is the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Hence, since the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, they can in no wise have a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination towards any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> whatsoever; consequently they cannot be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> rebukes Porphyry for saying that the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> deceitful; himself maintaining that they are not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> so, but of their own will. Now the reason why Porphyry held that they are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> deceitful was that, as he contended, <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are animals with a sensitive <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now the sensitive <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is inclined towards some particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, with which <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> may be connected. In this way, then, it can have a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; yet only <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is connected with <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of some men can be called <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, either because of custom which is a second <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; or on account of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> proclivity on the part of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to some inordinate passion, as some people are said to be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> wrathful or <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lustful</a>; but not on the part of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Brute beasts have a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination in their sensitive <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> towards certain particular goods, with which certain <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> are connected; thus the fox in seeking its food has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination to do so with a certain skill coupled with deceit. Wherefore it is not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the fox to be sly, since it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to him; as it is not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the dog to be fierce, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> observes (De Div. Nom. iv).

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the devil was wicked by the fault of his own will in the first instant of his creation?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> was <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> by the fault of his own will in the first instant of his creation. For it is said of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> (<a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse44">John 8:44</a>): "He was a murderer from the beginning."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. i, 15), the lack of form in the creature did not precede its formation in order of time, but merely in order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now according to him (Gen. ad lit. ii, 8), the "<a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>," which is said to have been <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in the beginning, signifies the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> while as yet not fully formed: and when it is said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> said: "Be light made: and light was made," we are to understand the full formation of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> by turning to the Word. Consequently, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>, and light was made, in the one instant. But at the same moment that light was made, it was made distinct from "darkness," whereby the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> are denoted. Therefore in the first instant of their creation some of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were made blessed, and some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is opposed to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. But some <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> can <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> in the first instant of its creation; as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or also the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> likewise could <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the first instant of their creation.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is more powerful than the corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But a corporeal thing begins to have its operation in the first instant of its creation; as fire begins to move upwards in the first instant it is produced. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> could also have his operation in the first instant of his creation. Now this operation was either ordinate or inordinate. If ordinate, then, since he had <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, he thereby <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> beatitude. But with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> the reward follows immediately upon <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>; as was said above (Question 62, Article 5). Consequently they would have become blessed at once; and so would never have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. It remains, then, that they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> by inordinate action in their first instant.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse31">Genesis 1:31</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> saw all the things that He had made, and they were very <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." But among them were also the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> were at some time <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some have maintained that the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> were <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> straightway in the first instant of their creation; not by their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but by the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of their own will; because, as soon as he was made, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> refused righteousness. To this opinion, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xi, 13), if anyone subscribes, he does not agree with those Manichean <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who say that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of itself. Since this opinion, however, is in contradiction with the authority of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>--for it is said of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> under the figure of the prince of Babylon (<a href="../bible/isa014.htm#verse12">Isaiah 14:12</a>): "How art thou fallen . . . O Lucifer, who didst rise in the morning!" and it is said to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the King of Tyre (<a href="../bible/eze028.htm#verse13">Ezekiel 28:13</a>): "Thou wast in the pleasures of the paradise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," --consequently, this opinion was reasonably rejected by the masters as <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>.

<p>Hence others have said that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, in the first instant of their creation, could have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, but did not. Yet this view also is repudiated by some, because, when two operations follow one upon the other, it seems impossible for each operation to terminate in the one instant. Now it is clear that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was an act subsequent to his creation. But the term of the creative act is the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> very being, while the term of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act is the being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. It seems, then, an impossibility for the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to have been <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> in the first instant of his <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>.

<p>This argument, however, does not satisfy. For it holds good only in such movements as are measured by time, and take place successively; thus, if local movement follows a change, then the change and the local movement cannot be terminated in the same instant. But if the changes are instantaneous, then all at once and in the same instant there can be a term to the first and the second change; thus in the same instant in which the moon is lit up by the sun, the atmosphere is lit up by the moon. Now, it is manifest that creation is instantaneous; so also is the movement of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; for, as has been already stated, they have no occasion for comparison or discursive reasoning (58, 3). Consequently, there is nothing to hinder the term of creation and of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> from <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the same instant.

<p>We must therefore reply that, on the contrary, it was impossible for the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the first instant by an inordinate act of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. For although a thing can begin to act in the first instant of its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, nevertheless, that operation which begins with the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> comes of the agent from which it drew its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; just as upward movement in fire comes of its productive <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Therefore, if there be anything which derives its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> from a defective <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, which can be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a defective action, it can in the first instant of its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> have a defective operation; just as the leg, which is defective from birth, through a defect in the principle of generation, begins at once to limp. But the agent which brought the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, namely, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, cannot be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Consequently it cannot be said that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> was <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> in the first instant of his creation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xi, 15), when it is stated that "the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> from the beginning," "he is not to be thought of as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> from the beginning wherein he was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>, but from the beginning of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>": that is to say, because he never went back from his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> That distinction of light and darkness, whereby the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are understood by the term darkness, must be taken as according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> foreknowledge. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xi, 15), that "He alone could discern light and darkness, Who also could foreknow, before they fell, those who would fall."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> All that is in <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and consequently an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> could <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> in the first instant of his creation. The same reason does not hold <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; as has been said.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> did not distinguish between the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> before the turning away of some of them, and the turning of others to Himself, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xi, 15). Therefore, as all were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, all <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> in their first instant. But some of them at once placed an impediment to their beatitude, thereby destroying their preceding <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>; and consequently they were deprived of the beatitude which they had <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether there was any interval between the creation and the fall of the angel?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there was some interval between the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> creation and his fall. For, it is said (<a href="../bible/eze028.htm#verse15">Ezekiel 28:15</a>): "Thou didst walk perfect [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Thou hast walked in the midst of the stones of fire; thou wast perfect . . .'] in thy ways from the day of thy creation until <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> was found in thee." But since walking is continuous movement, it requires an interval. Therefore there was some interval between the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> creation and his fall.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> says (Hom. i in Ezech.) that "the serpent of old did not from the first walk upon his breast and belly"; which refers to his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> did not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> at once after the first instant of his creation.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, capability of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> is common alike to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. But there was some delay between <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> formation and his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore, for the like reason there was some interval between the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> formation and his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the instant wherein the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> was distinct from the instant wherein he was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>. But there is a middle time between every two instants. Therefore there was an interval between his creation and his fall.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> (<a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse44">John 8:44</a>): "He stood not in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>": and, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xi, 15), "we must understand this in the sense, that he was in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but did not remain in it."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There is a twofold opinion on this point. But the more probable one, which is also more in harmony with the teachings of the Saints, is that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> at once after the first instant of his creation. This must be maintained if it be held that he elicited an act of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> in the first instant of his creation, and that he was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; as we have said (62, 3). For since the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> attain beatitude by one <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> act, as was said above (Question 62, Article 5), if the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> in the first instant, he would at once have received beatitude after that first instant, if he had not placed an impediment by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>.

<p>If, however, it be contended that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> was not <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, or that he could not elicit an act of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> in the first instant, then there is nothing to prevent some interval being interposed between his creation and fall.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Sometimes in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Scripture</a> <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> instantaneous movements are represented by corporeal movements which are measured by <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. In this way by "walking" we are to understand the movement of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> tending towards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> says, "The serpent of old did not from the first walk upon his breast and belly," because of the first instant in which he was not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> An <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> has an inflexible <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> after once choosing; consequently, if after the first instant, in which he had a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> movement to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, he had not at once placed a barrier to beatitude, he would have been confirmed in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. It is not so with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; and therefore the argument does not hold <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to say that there is a middle time between every two instants, so far as time is continuous, as it is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> Phys. vi, text. 2. But in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who are not subject to the heavenly movement, which is primarily measured by continuous time, time is taken to mean the succession of their <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> acts, or of their affections. So the first instant in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> is understood to respond to the operation of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> mind, whereby it introspects itself by its evening <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> because on the first day evening is mentioned, but not morning. This operation was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in them all. From such operation some of them were converted to the praise of the Word by their morning <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> while others, absorbed in themselves, became night, "swelling up with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. iv, 24). Hence the first act was common to them all; but in their second they were separated. Consequently they were all of them <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in the first instant; but in the second the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> were set apart from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the highest angel among those who sinned was the highest of all?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the highest among the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> was not the highest of all. For it is stated (<a href="../bible/eze028.htm#verse14">Ezekiel 28:14</a>): "Thou wast a cherub stretched out, and protecting, and I set thee in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mountain of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Now the order of the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">Cherubim</a> is under the order of the <a href="../cathen/13725b.htm">Seraphim</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. vi, vii). Therefore, the highest <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> among those who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> was not the highest of all.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in order that it might attain to beatitude. If therefore the highest of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, it follows that the Divine ordinance was frustrated in the noblest creature which is unfitting.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the more a subject is inclined towards anything, so much the less can it fall away from it. But the higher an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is, so much the more is he inclined towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore so much the less can he turn away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>. And so it seems that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> was not the highest of all, but one of the lower <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Hom. xxxiv in Ev.) says that the chief <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, "being set over all the hosts of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, surpassed them in brightness, and was by comparison the most illustrious among them."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Two things have to be considered in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, namely, the proneness to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and the motive for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>. If, then, in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> we consider the proneness to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it seems that the higher <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were less likely to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than the lower. On this account <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii), that the highest of those who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> was set over the terrestrial order. This opinion seems to agree with the view of the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a>, which <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> quotes (De Civ. Dei vii, 6,7; x, 9,10,11). For they said that all the gods were <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; whereas some of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> were <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and some bad; naming as 'gods' the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> which are above the lunar sphere, and calling by the name of "<a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>" the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> which are beneath it, yet higher than men in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Nor is this opinion to be rejected as contrary to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; because the whole corporeal creation is governed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iii, 4,5). Consequently there is nothing to prevent us from saying that the lower <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were divinely set aside for presiding over the lower bodies, the higher over the higher bodies; and the highest to stand before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And in this sense <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii) that they who fell were of the lower grade of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; yet in that order some of them remained <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p>But if the motive for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> be considered, we find that it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in the higher <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> more than in the lower. For, as has been said (2), the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>' <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>; and the motive of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is excellence, which was greater in the higher spirits. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says that he who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> was the very highest of all. This seems to be the more probable view: because the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>' <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> did not come of any proneness, but of free choice alone. Consequently that argument seems to have the more weight which is drawn from the motive in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>. Yet this must not be prejudicial to the other view; because there might be some motive for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> in him also who was the chief of the lower <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">Cherubim</a> is interpreted "fulness of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>," while "<a href="../cathen/13725b.htm">Seraphim</a>" means "those who are on fire," or "who set on fire." Consequently <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">Cherubim</a> is derived from <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; which is compatible with mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but <a href="../cathen/13725b.htm">Seraphim</a> is derived from the heat of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which is incompatible with mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore the first <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> is called, not a Seraph, but a Cherub.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The Divine <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is not frustrated either in those who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or in those who are saved; for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> beforehand the end of both; and He procures <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> from both, saving these of His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, and punishing those of His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> creature, when it <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, falls away from its due end. Nor is this unfitting in any exalted creature; because the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> creature was so made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that it lies within its own will to act for its end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> However great was the inclination towards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in the highest <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, there was no <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> imposed upon him: consequently it was in his power not to follow it.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether the sin of the highest angel was the cause of the others sinning?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the highest <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> was not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the others <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> precedes the effect. But, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> observes (De Fide Orth. ii), they all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> at one time. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of one was not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the others' <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can only be <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, as was shown above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). But <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> seeks excellence. Now it is more contrary to excellence for anyone to be subject to an inferior than to a superior; and so it does not appear that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> by desiring to be subject to a higher <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> rather than to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Yet the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> would have been the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the others <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, if he had induced them to be his subjects. Therefore it does not appear that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the highest <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the others <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is a greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to wish to be subject to another against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, than to wish to be over another against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; because there is less motive for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>. If, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the foremost <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the others <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, in that he induced them to subject themselves to him, then the lower <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> would have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> more deeply than the highest one; which is contrary to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/psa103.htm#verse26">Psalm 103:26</a>: "This dragon which Thou hast formed--He who was the more excellent than the rest in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, became the greater in <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the highest <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> was not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the others <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/rev012.htm#verse4">Apocalypse 12:4</a>) that the dragon "drew" with him "the third part of the stars of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the highest <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the others <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>; not as compelling them, but as inducing them by a kind of exhortation. A token thereof appears in this, that all the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are subjects of that highest one; as is evident from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> words: "Go [Vulg. 'Depart from Me'], you <a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">cursed</a>, into everlasting fire, which was prepared for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>" (<a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse41">Matthew 25:41</a>). For the order of Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> exacts that whosoever consents to another's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> suggestion, shall be subjected to him in his punishment; according to (<a href="../bible/2pe002.htm#verse19">2 Peter 2:19</a>): "By whom a man is overcome, of the same also he is the <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in the one instant, yet the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of one could be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the rest <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> needs no delay of time for choice, exhortation, or consent, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who requires deliberation in order to choose and consent, and vocal speech in order to exhort; both of which are the work of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. And it is evident that even <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> begins to speak in the very instant when he takes thought; and in the last instant of speech, another who catches his meaning can assent to what is said; as is especially evident with regard to primary concepts, "which everyone accepts directly they are heard" [<a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a>, De Hebdom.]. Taking away, then, the time for speech and deliberation which is required in us; in the same instant in which the highest <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> expressed his affection by intelligible speech, it was possible for the others to consent thereto.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Other things being equal, the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> would rather be subject to a superior than to an inferior. Yet he chooses rather to be subject to an inferior than to a superior, if he can procure an advantage under an inferior which he cannot under a superior. Consequently it was not against the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>' <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> for them to wish to serve an inferior by yielding to his rule; for they wanted to have him as their prince and leader, so that they might attain their ultimate beatitude of their own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers; especially because in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> they were even then subject to the highest <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As was observed above (Question 62, Article 6), an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> has nothing in him to retard his action, and with his whole might he is moved to whatsoever he is moved, be it <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or bad. Consequently since the highest <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> had greater <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> energy than the lower <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, he fell into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with intenser energy, and therefore he became the greater in <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether those who sinned were as many as those who remained firm?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that more <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> than stood firm. For, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 6): "<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">Evil</a> is in many, but <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is in few."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are to be found in the same way in men and in <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. But there are more <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men to be found than <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; according to <a href="../bible/ecc001.htm#verse15">Ecclesiastes 1:15</a>: "The number of fools is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>." Therefore for the same reason it is so with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are distinguished according to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and orders. Therefore if more <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> stood firm, it would appear that those who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> were not from all the orders.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/2ki006.htm#verse16">2 Kings 6:16</a>): "There are more with us than with them": which is expounded of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who are with us to aid us, and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> spirits who are our foes.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> More <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> stood firm than <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>. Because <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination; while that which is against the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order happens with less frequency; for <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> procures its effects either always, or more often than not.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> is speaking with regard to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, in whom <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> comes to pass from seeking after sensible pleasures, which are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to most men, and from forsaking the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> dictated by reason, which <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the few. In the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> there is only an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; hence the argument does not hold.

<p>And from this we have the answer to the second difficulty.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> According to those who hold that the chief <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> belonged to the lower order of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who are set over earthly affairs, it is evident that some of every order did not fall, but only those of the lowest order. According to those who maintain that the chief <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> was of the highest order, it is probable that some fell of every order; just as men are taken up into every order to supply for the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> ruin. In this view the liberty of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is more established; which in every degree of creature can be turned to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Sacred Scripture</a>, however, the names of some orders, as of <a href="../cathen/13725b.htm">Seraphim</a> and Thrones, are not attributed to <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; since they are derived from the ardor of love and from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> indwelling, which are not consistent with mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Yet the names of <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">Cherubim</a>, Powers, and Principalities are attributed to them; because these names are derived from <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and from power, which can be common to both <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and bad.
