<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether a sacrament imprints a character on the soul?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> does not imprint a character on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For the word "character" seems to signify some kind of distinctive sign. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> members are distinguished from others by <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, which does not imply anything in the predestined, but only in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinating</a>, as we have stated in I, 23, 2. For it is written (<a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse19">2 Timothy 2:19</a>): "The sure foundation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> standeth firm, having this seal: The Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> who are His." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> do not imprint a character on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a character is a distinctive sign. Now a sign, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. ii) "is that which conveys something else to the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, besides the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> which it impresses on the senses." But nothing in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> can impress a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> on the senses. Therefore it seems that no character is imprinted on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as the believer is distinguished from the unbeliever by the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, so was it under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> did not imprint a character; whence they are called "justices of the flesh" (<a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse10">Hebrews 9:10</a>) by the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>. Therefore neither seemingly do the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/2co001.htm#verse21">2 Corinthians 1:21-22</a>): "He . . . that hath anointed us is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; Who also hath sealed us, and given the pledge of the spirit in our hearts." But a character means nothing else than a kind of sealing. Therefore it seems that by the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> imprints His character on us.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As is clear from what has been already stated (62, 5) the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> are ordained for a twofold purpose; namely, for a remedy against <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and for the perfecting of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in things pertaining to the Divine worship according to the rite of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life. Now whenever anyone is deputed to some definite purpose he is wont to receive some outward sign thereof; thus in olden times soldiers who enlisted in the ranks used to be marked with certain characters on the body, through being deputed to a bodily service. Since, therefore, by the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> men are deputed to a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> service pertaining to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it follows that by their means the faithful receive a certain <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> character. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Parmen. ii): "If a deserter from the battle, through dread of the mark of enlistment on his body, throws himself on the emperor's clemency, and having besought and received mercy, return to the fight; is that character renewed, when the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has been set free and reprimanded? is it not rather acknowledged and approved? Are the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, by any chance, of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> less lasting than this bodily mark?"

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The faithful of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> are destined to the reward of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> that is to come, by the seal of Divine Predestination. But they are deputed to acts becoming the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that is now, by a certain <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> seal that is set on them, and is called a character.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The character imprinted on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a kind of sign in so far as it is imprinted by a sensible sacrament: since we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that a certain one has received the baptismal character, through his being cleansed by the sensible water. Nevertheless from a kind of likeness, anything that assimilates one thing to another, or discriminates one thing from another, even though it be not sensible, can be called a character or a seal; thus the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> calls <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> "the figure" or <em>charakter</em> "of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the Father" (<a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse3">Hebrews 1:3</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (Question 62, Article 6) the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> had not in themselves any <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power of producing a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> effect. Consequently in those <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> there was no need of a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> character, and bodily <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> sufficed, which the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> calls "a seal" (<a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse11">Romans 4:11</a>).

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether a character is a spiritual power?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that a character is not a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power. For "character" seems to be the same thing as "figure"; hence (<a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse3">Hebrews 1:3</a>), where we read "figure of His <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, "for "figure" the Greek has <em>charakter</em>. Now "figure" is in the fourth <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, and thus differs from power which is in the second <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Therefore character is not a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. ii): "The Divine Beatitude admits him that seeks <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> to a share in Itself, and grants this share to him by conferring on him Its light as a kind of seal." Consequently, it seems that a character is a kind of light. Now light belongs rather to the third <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>. Therefore a character is not a power, since this seems to belong to the second <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, character is defined by some thus: "A character is a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> sign of the communion of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> ordination conferred by a hierarch." Now a sign is in the genus of "relation," not of "power." Therefore a character is not a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, a power is in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and principle (Metaph. v). But a "sign" which is set down in the definition of a character is rather in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an effect. Therefore a character is not a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii): "There are three things in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, power, <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, and passion." Now a character is not a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>: since a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> passes quickly, whereas a character is indelible, as will be made clear further on (5). In like manner it is not a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>: because no <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is indifferent to acting well or ill: whereas a character is indifferent to either, since some use it well, some ill. Now this cannot occur with a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>: because no one abuses a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, or uses well an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. It remains, therefore, that a character is a power.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> produce a character, in so far as by them we are deputed to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> according to the rite of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Eccl. Hier. ii), after saying that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "by a kind of sign grants a share of Himself to those that approach Him," adds "by making them Godlike and communicators of Divine <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>." Now the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> consists either in receiving Divine <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, or in bestowing them on others. And for both these purposes some power is needed; for to bestow something on others, active power is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>; and in order to receive, we need a passive power. Consequently, a character signifies a certain <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power ordained unto things pertaining to the Divine worship.

<p>But it must be observed that this <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power is instrumental: as we have stated above (Question 62, Article 4) of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which is in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. For to have a sacramental character belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> ministers: and a minister is a kind of instrument, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Polit. i). Consequently, just as the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which is in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> is not of itself in a genus, but is reducible to a genus, for the reason that it is of a transitory and incomplete <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: so also a character is not properly in a genus or <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but is reducible to the second <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Configuration is a certain boundary of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. Wherefore, properly speaking, it is only in corporeal things; and of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things is said metaphorically. Now that which decides the genus or <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of a thing must needs be predicated of it properly. Consequently, a character cannot be in the fourth <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, although some have held this to be the case.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The third <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> contains only sensible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> or sensible <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>. Now a character is not a sensible light. Consequently, it is not in the third <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> as some have maintained.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The relation signified by the word "sign" must needs have some foundation. Now the relation signified by this sign which is a character, cannot be founded immediately on the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: because then it would belong to every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>. Consequently, there must be something in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> on which such a relation is founded. And it is in this that a character <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> consists. Therefore it need not be in the genus "relation" as some have held.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> A character is in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a sign in comparison to the sensible sacrament by which it is imprinted. But considered in itself, it is in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a principle, in the way already explained.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the sacramental character is the character of Christ?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the sacramental character is not the character of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse30">Ephesians 4:30</a>): "Grieve not the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whereby you are sealed." But a character consists <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> in some. thing that seals. Therefore the sacramental character should be attributed to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> rather than to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a character has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a sign. And it is a sign of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that is conferred by the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is poured forth into the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by the whole <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>; wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/psa083.htm#verse12">Psalm 83:12</a>): "The Lord will give <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>." Therefore it seems that the sacramental character should not be attributed specially to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a man is marked with a character that he may be distinguishable from others. But the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are distinguishable from others by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xv), "alone separates the children of the Kingdom from the children of perdition": wherefore also the children of perdition are said to have "the character of the beast" (<a href="../bible/rev013.htm#verse16">Apocalypse 13:16-17</a>). But <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not attributed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but rather to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> according to <a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans 5:5</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is poured forth in our hearts, by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, Who is given to us"; or even to the Father, according to <a href="../bible/2co013.htm#verse13">2 Corinthians 13:13</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore it seems that the sacramental character should not be attributed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Some define character thus: "A character is a distinctive mark printed in a man's rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Character, whereby the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> trinity is sealed with the likeness of the creating and re-creating <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, and distinguishing him from those who are not so enlikened, according to the state of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Character is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself, according to <a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse3">Hebrews 1:3</a>: "Who being the brightness of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and the figure," or character, "of His <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>." It seems, therefore, that the character should properly be attributed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As has been made clear above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), a character is properly a kind of seal, whereby something is marked, as being ordained to some particular end: thus a coin is marked for use in exchange of goods, and soldiers are marked with a character as being deputed to military service. Now the faithful are deputed to a twofold end. First and principally to the enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. And for this purpose they are marked with the seal of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> according to <a href="../bible/eze009.htm#verse4">Ezekiel 9:4</a>: "Mark Thou upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and mourn"; and <a href="../bible/rev007.htm#verse3">Apocalypse 7:3</a>: "Hurt not the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, till we sign the servants of our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in their foreheads."

<p>Secondly, each of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> is deputed to receive, or to bestow on others, things pertaining to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And this, properly speaking, is the purpose of the sacramental character. Now the whole rite of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> is derived from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. Consequently, it is clear that the sacramental character is specially the character of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, to Whose character the faithful are likened by reason of the sacramental characters, which are nothing else than certain participations of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Priesthood, flowing from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> speaks there of that sealing by which a man is assigned to future <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and which is effected by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is attributed to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, inasmuch as it is through love that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gives us something gratis, which is the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: while the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is love. Wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse4">1 Corinthians 12:4</a>): "There are diversities of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>, but the same Spirit."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The sacramental character is a thing as regards the exterior sacrament, and a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> in regard to the ultimate effect. Consequently, something can be attributed to a character in two ways. First, if the character be considered as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>: and thus it is a sign of the invisible <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which is conferred in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Secondly, if it be considered as a character. And thus it is a sign conferring on a man a likeness to some principal <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in whom is vested the authority over that to which he is assigned: thus soldiers who are assigned to military service, are marked with their leader's sign, by which they are, in a fashion, likened to him. And in this way those who are deputed to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> worship, of which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the author, receive a character by which they are likened to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Consequently, properly speaking, this is Christ's character.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A character distinguishes one from another, in relation to some particular end, to which he, who receives the character is ordained: as has been stated concerning the military character (1) by which a soldier of the king is distinguished from the enemy's soldier in relation to the battle. In like manner the character of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> is that by which the faithful of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> are distinguished from the servants of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, either in relation to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, or in relation to the worship of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that now is. Of these the former is the result of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as the objection runs; while the latter results from the sacramental character. Wherefore the "character of the beast" may be understood by opposition, to mean either the obstinate <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> for which some are assigned to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a>, or the profession of an unlawful form of worship.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the character be subjected in the powers of the soul?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the character is not subjected in the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For a character is said to be a disposition to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is subjected in the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as we have stated [in I-II, 110, 4]. Therefore it seems that the character is in the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and not in the powers.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not seem to be the subject of anything save <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> and disposition. But a character, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), is neither <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> nor disposition, but rather a power: the subject of which is nothing else than the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore it seems that the character is not subjected in a power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but rather in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are divided into those of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and those of <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. But it cannot be said that a character is only in a cognitive power, nor, again, only in an <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power: since it is neither ordained to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> only, nor to desire only. Likewise, neither can it be said to be in both, because the same <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> cannot be in several subjects. Therefore it seems that a character is not subjected in a power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but rather in the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A character, according to its definition given above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), is imprinted in the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> "by way of an image." But the image of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is seen in the powers. Therefore a character is in the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), a character is a kind of seal by which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is marked, so that it may receive, or bestow on others, things pertaining to Divine worship. Now the Divine worship consists in certain actions: and the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are properly ordained to actions, just as the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is ordained to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. Therefore a character is subjected not in the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but in its power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The subject is ascribed to an. <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> in respect of that to which the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> disposes it proximately, but not in respect of that to which it disposes it remotely or indirectly. Now a character disposes the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> directly and proximately to the fulfilling of things pertaining to Divine worship: and because such cannot be accomplished suitably without the help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, since, according to <a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse24">John 4:24</a>, "they that <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a>" <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "must <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> Him in spirit and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>," consequently, the Divine bounty bestows <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> on those who receive the character, so that they may accomplish worthily the service to which they are deputed. Therefore the subject should be ascribed to a character in respect of those actions that pertain to the Divine worship, rather than in respect of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The subject of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power, which flows from the principles of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Now a character is not a power of this kind. but a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power coming from without. Wherefore, just as the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, from which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> life, is perfected by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> from which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> derives <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life; so the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is perfected by a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power, which is a character. For <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> and disposition belong to a power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, since they are ordained to actions of which the powers are the principles. And in like manner whatever is ordained to action, should be attributed to a power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above, a character is ordained unto things pertaining to the Divine worship; which is a protestation of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> expressed by exterior signs. Consequently, a character needs to be in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> cognitive power, where also is <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether a character can be blotted out from the soul?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that a character can be blotted out from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Because the more perfect an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> is, the more firmly does it adhere to its subject. But <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is more perfect than a character; because a character is ordained unto <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> as to a further end. Now <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is lost through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Much more, therefore, is a character so lost.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, by a character a man is deputed to the Divine worship, as stated above (3,4). But some pass from the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to a contrary worship by apostasy from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. It seems, therefore, that such lose the sacramental character.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, when the end ceases, the means to the end should cease also: thus after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> there will be no marriage, because begetting will cease, which is the purpose of marriage. Now the exterior worship to which a character is ordained, will not endure in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, where there will be no shadows, but all will be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> without a veil. Therefore the sacramental character does not last in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> for ever: and consequently it can be blotted out.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Parmen. ii): "The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are not less lasting than the bodily mark" of military service. But the character of military service is not repeated, but is "recognized and approved" in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who obtains the emperor's forgiveness after offending him. Therefore neither can the sacramental character be blotted out.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), in a sacramental character Christ's faithful have a share in His Priesthood; in the sense that as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has the full power of a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, so His faithful are likened to Him by sharing a certain <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power with regard to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and to things pertaining to the Divine worship. For this reason it is unbecoming that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should have a character: but His Priesthood is compared to a character, as that which is complete and perfect is compared to some participation of itself. Now Christ's Priesthood is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa109.htm#verse4">Psalm 109:4</a>: "Thou art a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> for ever, according to the order of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a>." Consequently, every sanctification wrought by His Priesthood, is perpetual, enduring as long as the thing sanctified endures. This is clear even in inanimate things; for the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of a church or an altar lasts for ever unless they be destroyed. Since, therefore, the subject of a character is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as to its <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> part, where <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> resides, as stated above (4, ad 3); it is clear that, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> being perpetual and incorruptible, a character cannot be blotted out from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Both <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and character are in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but in different ways. For <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as a form having complete <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> therein: whereas a character is in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as an instrumental power, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Now a complete form is in its subject according to the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the subject. And since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as long as it is a wayfarer is changeable in respect of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, it results that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in a changeable manner. But an instrumental power follows rather the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the principal agent: and consequently a character <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in an indelible manner, not from any perfection of its own, but from the perfection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Priesthood, from which the character flows like an instrumental power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Parmen. ii), "even apostates are not deprived of their <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, for when they repent and return to the fold they do not receive it again; whence we conclude that it cannot be lost." The reason of this is that a character is an instrumental power, as stated above (ad 1), and the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an instrument as such is to be moved by another, but not to move itself; this belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Consequently, however much the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> be moved in the contrary direction, the character is not removed, by reason of the immobility of the principal mover.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although external worship does not last after this life, yet its end remains. Consequently, after this life the character remains, both in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as adding to their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> as increasing their shame: just as the character of the military service remains in the soldiers after the victory, as the boast of the conquerors, and the disgrace of the conquered.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether a character is imprinted by each sacrament of the New Law?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that a character is imprinted by all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>: because each sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> makes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> a participator in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Priesthood. But the sacramental character is nothing but a participation in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Priesthood, as already stated (3,5). Therefore it seems that a character is imprinted by each sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a character may be compared to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in which it is, as a <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> to that which is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>. But by each sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> becomes the recipient of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, as stated above (Question 62, Article 1). Therefore it seems that a character is imprinted by each sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a character is both a reality and a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. But in each sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, there is something which is only a reality, and something which is only a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, and something which is both reality and sacrament. Therefore a character is imprinted by each sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Those <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> in which a character is imprinted, are not reiterated, because a character is indelible, as stated above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>): whereas some <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are reiterated, for instance, penance and <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>. Therefore not all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> imprint a character.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (62, 1,5), the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> are ordained for a twofold purpose, namely, as a remedy for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and for the Divine worship. Now all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, from the fact that they confer <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, have this in common, that they afford a remedy against <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: whereas not all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are directly ordained to the Divine worship. Thus it is clear that penance, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is delivered from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, does not afford <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> any advance in the Divine worship, but restores him to his former state.

<p>Now a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> may belong to the Divine worship in three ways: first in regard to the thing done; secondly, in regard to the agent; thirdly, in regard to the recipient. In regard to the thing done, the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> belongs to the Divine worship, for the Divine worship consists principally therein, so far as it is the sacrifice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. And by this same sacrament a character is not imprinted on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; because it does not ordain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to any further sacramental action or benefit received, since rather is it "the end and consummation of all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>," as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. iii). But it contains within itself <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in Whom there is not the character, but the very plenitude of the Priesthood.

<p>But it is the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacrament of order</a> that pertains to the sacramental agents: for it is by this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> that men are deputed to confer <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> on others: while the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> pertains to the recipients, since it confers on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> the power to receive the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; whence it is called the "door of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>." In a way Confirmation also is ordained for the same purpose, as we shall explain in its proper place (65, 3). Consequently, these three <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> imprint a character, namely, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, Confirmation, and order.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Every sacrament makes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of the a participator in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Priesthood, from the fact that it confers on him some effect thereof. But every sacrament does not depute a man to do or receive something pertaining to the worship of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of Christ: while it is just this that is required for a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> to imprint a character.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> is sanctified by each of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, since sanctity means immunity from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is the effect of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But in a special way some <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, which imprint a character, bestow on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> a certain <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, thus deputing him to the Divine worship: just as inanimate things are said to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> forasmuch as they are deputed to Divine worship.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although a character is a reality and a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, it does not follow that whatever is a reality and a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, is also a character. With regard to the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> we shall explain further on what is the reality and what is the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.
