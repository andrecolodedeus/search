<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether it is unlawful to kill any living thing?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem unlawful to kill any living thing. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse2">Romans 13:2</a>): "They that resist the ordinance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> purchase to themselves damnation [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'He that resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and they that resist, purchase themselves damnation.']." Now <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a> has ordained that all living things should be preserved, according to <a href="../bible/psa146.htm#verse8">Psalm 146:8-9</a>, "Who maketh grass to grow on the mountains . . . Who giveth to beasts their food." Therefore it seems unlawful to take the life of any living thing.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> because it deprives a man of life. Now life is common to all animals and plants. Hence for the same reason it is apparently a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to slay dumb animals and plants.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> a special punishment is not appointed save for a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now a special punishment had to be inflicted, according to the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, on one who killed another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> ox or sheep (<a href="../bible/exo022.htm#verse1">Exodus 22:1</a>). Therefore the slaying of dumb animals is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei i, 20): "When we hear it said, 'Thou shalt not kill,' we do not take it as referring to trees, for they have no sense, nor to irrational animals, because they have no fellowship with us. Hence it follows that the words, 'Thou shalt not kill' refer to the killing of a man."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in using a thing for the purpose for which it is. Now the order of things is such that the imperfect are for the perfect, even as in the process of generation <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> proceeds from imperfection to perfection. Hence it is that just as in the generation of a man there is first a living thing, then an animal, and lastly a man, so too things, like the plants, which merely have life, are all alike for animals, and all animals are for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Wherefore it is not unlawful if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> use plants for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of animals, and animals for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Polit. i, 3).

<p>Now the most <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> use would seem to consist in the fact that animals use plants, and men use animals, for food, and this cannot be done unless these be deprived of life: wherefore it is lawful both to take life from plants for the use of animals, and from animals for the use of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. On fact this is in keeping with the commandment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself: for it is written (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse29">Genesis 1:29-30</a>): "Behold I have given you every herb . . . and all trees . . . to be your meat, and to all beasts of the earth": and again (<a href="../bible/gen009.htm#verse3">Genesis 9:3</a>): "Everything that moveth and liveth shall be meat to you."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> According to the Divine ordinance the life of animals and plants is preserved not for themselves but for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Hence, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei i, 20), "by a most just ordinance of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a>, both their life and their death are subject to our use."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Dumb animals and plants are devoid of the life of reason whereby to set themselves in motion; they are moved, as it were by another, by a kind of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> impulse, a sign of which is that they are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> enslaved and accommodated to the uses of others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> He that kills another's ox, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, not through killing the ox, but through injuring another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in his property. Wherefore this is not a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> but of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> or robbery.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether it is lawful to kill sinners?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem unlawful to kill men who have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> in the parable (<a href="../bible/mat013.htm">Matthew 13</a>) forbade the uprooting of the cockle which denotes <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a>. Now whatever is forbidden by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to kill a sinner.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is conformed to Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Now according to Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> sinners are kept back for repentance, according to <a href="../bible/eze033.htm#verse11">Ezekiel 33:11</a>, "I desire not the death of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, but that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> turn from his way and live." Therefore it seems altogether <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> to kill sinners.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is not lawful, for any <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> end whatever, to do that which is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in itself, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Contra Mendac. vii) and the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. ii, 6). Now to kill a man is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in itself, since we are bound to have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> towards all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and "we wish our friends to live and to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>," according to Ethic. ix, 4. Therefore it is nowise lawful to kill a man who has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/exo022.htm#verse18">Exodus 22:18</a>): "Wizards thou shalt not suffer to live"; and (<a href="../bible/psa100.htm#verse8">Psalm 100:8</a>): "In the morning I put to death all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> of the land."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), it is lawful to kill dumb animals, in so far as they are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> directed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> use, as the imperfect is directed to the perfect. Now every part is directed to the whole, as imperfect to perfect, wherefore every part is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> for the sake of the whole. For this reason we observe that if the health of the whole body demands the excision of a member, through its being decayed or infectious to the other members, it will be both praiseworthy and advantageous to have it cut away. Now every <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is compared to the whole community, as part to whole. Therefore if a man be dangerous and infectious to the community, on account of some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it is praiseworthy and advantageous that he be killed in order to safeguard the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since "a little leaven corrupteth the whole lump" (<a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse6">1 Corinthians 5:6</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> commanded them to forbear from uprooting the cockle in order to spare the wheat, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. This occurs when the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> cannot be slain without the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> being killed with them, either because the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> lie hidden among the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, or because they have many followers, so that they cannot be killed without danger to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Parmen. iii, 2). Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> teaches that we should rather allow the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> to live, and that vengeance is to be delayed until the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">last judgment</a>, rather than that the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> be put to death together with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. When, however, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> incur no danger, but rather are protected and saved by the slaying of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, then the latter may be lawfully put to death.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> According to the order of His wisdom, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sometimes slays sinners forthwith in order to deliver the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, whereas sometimes He allows them time to repent, according as He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what is expedient for His <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>. This also does <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> imitate according to its powers; for it puts to death those who are dangerous to others, while it allows time for repentance to those who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> without grievously harming others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> By <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> departs from the order of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, and consequently falls away from the dignity of his manhood, in so far as he is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> free, and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> for himself, and he falls into the slavish state of the beasts, by being disposed of according as he is useful to others. This is expressed in <a href="../bible/psa048.htm#verse21">Psalm 48:21</a>: "Man, when he was in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, did not understand; he hath been compared to senseless beasts, and made like to them," and <a href="../bible/pro011.htm#verse29">Proverbs 11:29</a>: "The fool shall serve the wise." Hence, although it be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in itself to kill a man so long as he preserve his dignity, yet it may be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to kill a man who has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, even as it is to kill a beast. For a bad <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is worse than a beast, and is more harmful, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Polit. i, 1 and Ethic. vii, 6).

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether it is lawful for a private individual to kill a man who has sinned?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem lawful for a private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> to kill a man who has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>. For nothing unlawful is commanded in the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>. Yet, on account of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the molten calf, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> commanded (<a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse27">Exodus 32:27</a>): "Let every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> kill his brother, and friend, and neighbor." Therefore it is lawful for private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> to kill a sinner.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as stated above (2, ad 3), <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, on account of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is compared to the beasts. Now it is lawful for any private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> to kill a wild beast, especially if it be harmful. Therefore for the same reason, it is lawful for any private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> to kill a man who has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a man, though a private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, deserves praise for doing what is useful for the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now the slaying of evildoers is useful for the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Therefore it is deserving of praise if even private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> kill <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>-doers.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei i) [Can. Quicumque percutit, caus. xxiii, qu. 8: "A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who, without exercising public authority, kills an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>-doer, shall be judged guilty of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, and all the more, since he has dared to usurp a power which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has not given him."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), it is lawful to kill an evildoer in so far as it is directed to the welfare of the whole community, so that it belongs to him alone who has charge of the community's welfare. Thus it belongs to a physician to cut off a decayed limb, when he has been entrusted with the care of the health of the whole body. Now the care of the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is entrusted to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of rank having public authority: wherefore they alone, and not private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, can lawfully put evildoers to death.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> by whose authority a thing is done really does the thing as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> declares (Coel. Hier. iii). Hence according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei i, 21), "He slays not who owes his service to one who commands him, even as a sword is merely the instrument to him that wields it." Wherefore those who, at the Lord's command, slew their neighbors and friends, would seem not to have done this themselves, but rather He by whose authority they acted thus: just as a soldier slays the foe by the authority of his sovereign, and the executioner slays the robber by the authority of the judge.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A beast is by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> distinct from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, wherefore in the case of a wild beast there is no need for an authority to kill it; whereas, in the case of domestic animals, such authority is required, not for their sake, but on account of the owner's loss. On the other hand a man who has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> is not by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> distinct from <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> men; hence a public authority is requisite in order to condemn him to death for the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is lawful for any private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> to do anything for the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, provided it harm nobody: but if it be harmful to some other, it cannot be done, except by virtue of the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to whom it pertains to decide what is to be taken from the parts for the welfare of the whole.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether it is lawful for clerics to kill evil-doers?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem lawful for <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> to kill <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>-doers. For <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> especially should fulfil the precept of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse16">1 Corinthians 4:16</a>): "Be ye followers of me as I also am of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>," whereby we are called upon to imitate <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. Now the very <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> whom we worship puts evildoers to death, according to <a href="../bible/psa135.htm#verse10">Psalm 135:10</a>, "Who smote <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> with their firstborn." Again <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> made the Levites slay twenty-three thousand men on account of the worship of the calf (<a href="../bible/exo032.htm">Exodus 32</a>), the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Phinees slew the Israelite who went in to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of Madian (<a href="../bible/num025.htm">Numbers 25</a>), Samuel killed Agag king of <a href="../cathen/01377c.htm">Amalec</a> (<a href="../bible/1sa015.htm">1 Samuel 15</a>), Elias slew the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a> (<a href="../bible/1ki018.htm">1 Kings 18</a>), Mathathias killed the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who went up to the altar to sacrifice (<a href="../bible/1ma002.htm">1 Maccabees 2</a>); and, in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> killed Ananias and Saphira (<a href="../bible/act005.htm">Acts 5</a>). Therefore it seems that even <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> may kill <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>-doers.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power is greater than the secular and is more united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a> as "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> minister" lawfully puts evil-doers to death, according to <a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse4">Romans 13:4</a>. Much more therefore may <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, who are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> ministers and have <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power, put evil-doers to death.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whosoever lawfully accepts an office, may lawfully exercise the functions of that office. Now it belongs to the princely office to slay evildoers, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). Therefore those <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> who are earthly princes may lawfully slay malefactors.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse2">1 Timothy 3:2-3</a>): "It behooveth . . . a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to be without crime [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'blameless.' 'Without crime' is the reading in <a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse7">Titus 1:7</a>] . . . not given to wine, no striker."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is unlawful for <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> to kill, for two reasons. First, because they are chosen for the ministry of the altar, whereon is represented the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> of Christ slain "Who, when He was struck did not strike [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'When He suffered, He threatened not']" (<a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse23">1 Peter 2:23</a>). Therefore it becomes not <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> to strike or kill: for ministers should imitate their master, according to <a href="../bible/sir010.htm#verse2">Sirach 10:2</a>, "As the judge of the people is himself, so also are his ministers." The other reason is because <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> are entrusted with the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, wherein no punishment of death or of bodily maiming is appointed: wherefore they should abstain from such things in order that they may be fitting ministers of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> works in all things without exception whatever is right, yet in each one according to its mode. Wherefore everyone should imitate <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in that which is specially becoming to him. Hence, though <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> slays evildoers even corporally, it does not follow that all should imitate Him in this. As regards <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, he did not put Ananias and Saphira to death by his own authority or with his own hand, but published their death sentence pronounced by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The Priests or Levites of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> were the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, which appointed corporal penalties, so that it was fitting for them to slay with their own hands.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The ministry of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> is concerned with better things than corporal slayings, namely with things pertaining to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> welfare, and so it is not fitting for them to meddle with minor matters.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Ecclesiastical <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> accept the office of earthly princes, not that they may inflict capital punishment themselves, but that this may be carried into effect by others in virtue of their authority.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether it is lawful to kill oneself?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem lawful for a man to kill himself. For <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in so far as it is contrary to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. But no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can do an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> to himself, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in Ethic. v, 11. Therefore no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by killing himself.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is lawful, for one who exercises public authority, to kill <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>-doers. Now he who exercises public authority is sometimes an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>-doer. Therefore he may lawfully kill himself.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is lawful for a man to suffer spontaneously a lesser danger that he may avoid a greater: thus it is lawful for a man to cut off a decayed limb even from himself, that he may save his whole body. Now sometimes a man, by killing himself, avoids a greater <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, for example an unhappy life, or the shame of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore a man may kill himself.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, Samson killed himself, as related in <a href="../bible/jdg016.htm">Judges 16</a>, and yet he is numbered among the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> (<a href="../bible/heb011.htm">Hebrews 11</a>). Therefore it is lawful for a man to kill himself.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, it is related (<a href="../bible/2ma014.htm#verse42">2 Maccabees 14:42</a>) that a certain Razias killed himself, "choosing to die nobly rather than to fall into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, and to suffer abuses unbecoming his noble birth." Now nothing that is done nobly and bravely is unlawful. Therefore suicide is not unlawful.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei i, 20): "Hence it follows that the words 'Thou shalt not kill' refer to the killing of a man--not another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; therefore, not even thyself. For he who kills himself, kills nothing else than a man."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is altogether unlawful to kill oneself, for three reasons. First, because everything <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> loves itself, the result being that everything <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> keeps itself in being, and resists corruptions so far as it can. Wherefore suicide is contrary to the inclination of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> whereby every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should love himself. Hence suicide is always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as being contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> and to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Secondly, because every part, as such, belongs to the whole. Now every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is part of the community, and so, as such, he belongs to the community. Hence by killing himself he injures the community, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> declares (Ethic. v, 11). Thirdly, because life is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and is subject to His power, Who kills and makes to live. Hence whoever takes his own life, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even as he who kills another's <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against that <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave's</a> master, and as he who usurps to himself judgment of a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> not entrusted to him. For it belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone to pronounce sentence of death and life, according to <a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse39">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>, "I will kill and I will make to live."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Murder is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, not only because it is contrary to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but also because it is opposed to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> which a man should have towards himself: in this respect suicide is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in relation to oneself. On relation to the community and to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, by reason also of its opposition to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> One who exercises public authority may lawfully put to death an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>-doer, since he can pass judgment on him. But no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is judge of himself. Wherefore it is not lawful for one who exercises public authority to put himself to death for any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> whatever: although he may lawfully commit himself to the judgment of others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> is made master of himself through his <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>: wherefore he can lawfully dispose of himself as to those matters which pertain to this life which is ruled by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. But the passage from this life to another and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happier</a> one is subject not to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> but to the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence it is not lawful for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to take his own life that he may pass to a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happier</a> life, nor that he may escape any unhappiness whatsoever of the present life, because the ultimate and most fearsome <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of this life is death, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. iii, 6). Therefore to bring death upon oneself in order to escape the other afflictions of this life, is to adopt a greater <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in order to avoid a lesser. On like manner it is unlawful to take one's own life on account of one's having committed a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, both because by so doing one does oneself a very great injury, by depriving oneself of the time needful for repentance, and because it is not lawful to slay an evildoer except by the sentence of the public authority. Again it is unlawful for a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to kill herself lest she be violated, because she ought not to commit on herself the very great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of suicide, to avoid the lesser sir; of another. For she commits no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in being violated by force, provided she does not consent, since "without consent of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> there is no stain on the body," as the <a href="../cathen/09414a.htm">Blessed Lucy</a> declared. Now it is evident that fornication and <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> are less grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> than taking a man's, especially one's own, life: since the latter is most grievous, because one injures oneself, to whom one owes the greatest love. Moreover it is most dangerous since no time is left wherein to expiate it by repentance. Again it is not lawful for anyone to take his own life for fear he should consent to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because "<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> must not be done that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> may come" (<a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse8">Romans 3:8</a>) or that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> may be avoided especially if the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> be of small account and an uncertain event, for it is uncertain whether one will at some future time consent to a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is able to deliver <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> under any <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> whatever.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei i, 21), "not even Samson is to be excused that he crushed himself together with his enemies under the ruins of the house, except the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, Who had wrought many wonders through him, had secretly commanded him to do this." He assigns the same reason in the case of certain <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, who at the time of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> took their own lives, and who are commemorated by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> It belongs to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> that a man does not shrink from being slain by another, for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and that he may avoid <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But that a man take his own life in order to avoid penal <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> has indeed an appearance of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> (for which reason some, among whom was Razias, have killed themselves thinking to act from <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>), yet it is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, but rather a weakness of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> unable to bear penal <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iii, 7) and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei 22,23) declare.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether it is lawful to kill the innocent?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in some cases it is lawful to kill the innocent. The fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is never manifested by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, since on the contrary "the fear of the Lord driveth out <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>" (<a href="../bible/sir001.htm#verse27">Sirach 1:27</a>). Now <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was commended in that he feared the Lord, since he was willing to slay his innocent son. Therefore one may, without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, kill an innocent <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, among those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that are committed against one's neighbor, the more grievous seem to be those whereby a more grievous injury is inflicted on the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against. Now to be killed is a greater injury to a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> than to an innocent <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, because the latter, by death, passes forthwith from the unhappiness of this life to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Since then it is lawful in certain cases to kill a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, much more is it lawful to slay an innocent or a righteous <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, what is done in keeping with the order of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But sometimes a man is forced, according to the order of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, to slay an innocent <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>: for instance, when a judge, who is bound to judge according to the evidence, condemns to death a man whom he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> to be innocent but who is convicted by <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>; and again the executioner, who in obedience to the judge puts to death the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who has been <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> sentenced.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/exo023.htm#verse7">Exodus 23:7</a>): "The innocent and just <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> thou shalt not put to death."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> An <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may be considered in two ways: first, in himself; secondly, in relation to something else. If we consider a man in himself, it is unlawful to kill any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, since in every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> though he be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, we ought to love the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has made, and which is destroyed by slaying him. Nevertheless, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>) the slaying of a sinner becomes lawful in relation to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is corrupted by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. On the other hand the life of righteous men preserves and forwards the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since they are the chief part of the community. Therefore it is in no way lawful to slay the innocent.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is Lord of death and life, for by His decree both the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> and the righteous die. Hence he who at <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> command kills an innocent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as neither does <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Whose behest he executes: indeed his obedience to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> commands is a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that he <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> Him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In weighing the gravity of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> we must consider the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> rather than the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>. Wherefore he who kills a just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> more grievously than he who slays a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: first, because he injures one whom he should love more, and so acts more in opposition to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: secondly, because he inflicts an injury on a man who is less deserving of one, and so acts more in opposition to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: thirdly, because he deprives the community of a greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: fourthly, because he despises <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more, according to <a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse16">Luke 10:16</a>, "He that despiseth you despiseth Me." On the other hand it is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to the slaying that the just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whose life is taken be received by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> into <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If the judge <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who has been convicted by <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>, is innocent he must, like <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">Daniel</a>, examine the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> with great care, so as to find a motive for acquitting the innocent: but if he cannot do this he should remit him for judgment by a higher tribunal. If even this is impossible, he does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> if he pronounce sentence in accordance with the evidence, for it is not he that puts the innocent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to death, but they who stated him to be guilty. He that carries out the sentence of the judge who has condemned an innocent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, if the sentence contains an inexcusable <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, he should not obey, else there would be an excuse for the executions of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>: if however it contain no manifest <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, he does not has no right to discuss the judgment of his superior; nor is it he who slays the innocent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but the judge whose minister he is.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether it is lawful to kill a man in self-defense?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that nobody may lawfully kill a man in self-defense. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says to Publicola (Ep. xlvii): "I do not agree with the opinion that one may kill a man lest one be killed by him; unless one be a soldier, exercise a public office, so that one does it not for oneself but for others, having the power to do so, provided it be in keeping with one's <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>." Now he who kills a man in self-defense, kills him lest he be killed by him. Therefore this would seem to be unlawful.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, he says (De Lib. Arb. i, 5): "How are they free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in sight of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a>, who are guilty of taking a man's life for the sake of these contemptible things?" Now among contemptible things he reckons "those which men may forfeit unwillingly," as appears from the context (De Lib. Arb. i, 5): and the chief of these is the life of the body. Therefore it is unlawful for any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to take another's life for the sake of the life of his own body.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Pope Nicolas</a> [Nicolas I, Dist. 1, can. De his clericis] says in the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a>: "Concerning the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> about whom you have consulted Us, those, namely, who have killed a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> in self-defense, as to whether, after making amends by repenting, they may return to their former state, or rise to a higher degree; <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that in no case is it lawful for them to kill any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> under any circumstances whatever." Now <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> and laymen are alike bound to observe the moral precepts. Therefore neither is it lawful for laymen to kill anyone in self-defense.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than fornication or <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. Now nobody may lawfully commit simple fornication or <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> or any other mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in order to save his own life; since the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life is to be preferred to the life of the body. Therefore no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may lawfully take another's life in self-defense in order to save his own life.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, if the tree be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, so is the fruit, according to <a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse17">Matthew 7:17</a>. Now self-defense itself seems to be unlawful, according to <a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse19">Romans 12:19</a>: "Not defending [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'revenging'] yourselves, my dearly beloved." Therefore its result, which is the slaying of a man, is also unlawful.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/exo022.htm#verse2">Exodus 22:2</a>): "If a <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a> be found breaking into a house or undermining it, and be wounded so as to die; he that slew him shall not be guilty of blood." Now it is much more lawful to defend one's life than one's house. Therefore neither is a man guilty of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> if he kill another in defense of his own life.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Nothing hinders one act from having two effects, only one of which is intended, while the other is beside the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>. Now moral acts take their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> according to what is intended, and not according to what is beside the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, since this is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> as explained above (43, 3; I-II, 12, 1). Accordingly the act of self-defense may have two effects, one is the saving of one's life, the other is the slaying of the aggressor. Therefore this act, since one's <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is to save one's own life, is not unlawful, seeing that it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to everything to keep itself in "being," as far as possible. And yet, though proceeding from a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, an act may be rendered unlawful, if it be out of proportion to the end. Wherefore if a man, in self-defense, uses more than <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, it will be unlawful: whereas if he repel force with moderation his defense will be lawful, because according to the jurists [Cap. Significasti, De Homicid. volunt. vel casual.], "it is lawful to repel force by force, provided one does not exceed the limits of a blameless defense." Nor is it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> that a man omit the act of moderate self-defense in order to avoid killing the other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, since one is bound to take more care of one's own life than of another's. But as it is unlawful to take a man's life, except for the public authority acting for the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), it is not lawful for a man to intend killing a man in self-defense, except for such as have public authority, who while intending to kill a man in self-defense, refer this to the public <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as in the case of a soldier fighting against the foe, and in the minister of the judge struggling with robbers, although even these <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> if they be moved by private animosity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The words quoted from <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> refer to the case when one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> intends to kill another to save himself from death. The passage quoted in the Second Objection is to be understood in the same sense. Hence he says pointedly, "for the sake of these things," whereby he indicates the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>. This suffices for the Reply to the Second Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">Irregularity</a> results from the act though sinless of taking a man's life, as appears in the case of a judge who <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> condemns a man to death. For this reason a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>, though he kill a man in self-defense, is <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregular</a>, albeit he intends not to kill him, but to defend himself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The act of fornication or <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> directed to the preservation of one's own life, as is the act whence sometimes results the taking of a man's life.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The defense forbidden in this passage is that which comes from revengeful spite. Hence a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "Not defending yourselves--that is, not striking your enemy back."

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether one is guilty of murder through killing someone by chance?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one is guilty of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> through killing someone by chance. For we read (<a href="../bible/gen004.htm#verse23">Genesis 4:23-24</a>) that Lamech slew a man in mistake for a wild beast [The text of the Bible does not say so, but this was the Jewish traditional commentary on <a href="../bible/gen004.htm#verse23">Genesis 4:23</a>, and that he was accounted guilty of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>. Therefore one incurs the guilt of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> through killing a man by chance.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/exo021.htm#verse22">Exodus 21:22</a>): "If . . . one strike a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> with child, and she miscarry indeed . . . if her death ensue thereupon, he shall render life for life." Yet this may happen without any <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> her death. Therefore one is guilty of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> through killing someone by chance.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the Decretals [Dist. 1 contain several canons prescribing penalties for unintentional homicide. Now penalty is not due save for guilt. Therefore he who kills a man by chance, incurs the guilt of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says to Publicola (Ep. xlvii): "When we do a thing for a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and lawful purpose, if thereby we unintentionally <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> harm to anyone, it should by no means be imputed to us." Now it sometimes happens by chance that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is killed as a result of something done for a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> purpose. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who did it is not accounted guilty.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Phys. ii, 6) "chance is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that acts beside one's <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>." Hence chance happenings, strictly speaking, are neither intended nor <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. And since every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Vera Relig. xiv) it follows that chance happenings, as such, are not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p>Nevertheless it happens that what is not actually and directly <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> and intended, is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> and intended <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, according as that which removes an obstacle is called an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Wherefore he who does not remove something whence homicide results whereas he ought to remove it, is in a sense guilty of <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> homicide. This happens in two ways: first when a man <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> another's death through occupying himself with unlawful things which he ought to avoid: secondly, when he does not take sufficient care. Hence, according to jurists, if a man pursue a lawful occupation and take due care, the result being that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> loses his life, he is not guilty of that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> death: whereas if he be occupied with something unlawful, or even with something lawful, but without due care, he does not escape being guilty of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, if his action results in someone's death.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Lamech did not take sufficient care to avoid taking a man's life: and so he was not excused from being guilty of homicide.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> He that strikes a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> with child does something unlawful: wherefore if there results the death either of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> or of the animated fetus, he will not be excused from homicide, especially seeing that death is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> result of such a blow.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> According to the canons a penalty, is inflicted on those who <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> death unintentionally, through doing something unlawful, or failing to take sufficient care.
