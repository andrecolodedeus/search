<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether God alone, or the minister also, works inwardly unto the sacramental effect?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, but also the minister, works inwardly unto the sacramental effect. For the inward sacramental effect is to cleanse <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and enlighten him by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But it belongs to the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> "to cleanse, enlighten and perfect," as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> explains (Coel. Hier. v). Therefore it seems that the sacramental effect is the work not only of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but also of the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, certain <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are offered up in conferring the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the righteous are more acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than those of any other, according to <a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse31">John 9:31</a>: "If a man be a server of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and doth His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, him He heareth." Therefore it stems that a man obtains a greater sacramental effect if he receive it from a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> minister. Consequently, the interior effect is partly the work of the minister and not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is of greater account than an inanimate thing. But an inanimate thing contributes something to the interior effect: since "water touches the body and cleanses the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. lxxx in Joan.). Therefore the interior sacramental effect is partly the work of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse33">Romans 8:33</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that justifieth." Since, then, the inward effect of all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> is <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>, it seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone works the interior sacramental effect.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There are two ways of producing an effect; first, as a principal agent; secondly, as an instrument. In the former way the interior sacramental effect is the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone: first, because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone can enter the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> wherein the sacramental effect takes place; and no agent can operate immediately where it is not: secondly, because <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which is an interior sacramental effect is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, as we have established in I-II, 112, 1; while the character which is the interior effect of certain <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, is an instrumental power which flows from the principal agent, which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In the second way, however, the interior sacramental effect can be the work of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in so far as he works as a minister. For a minister is of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an instrument, since the action of both is applied to something extrinsic, while the interior effect is produced through the power of the principal agent, which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Cleansing in so far as it is attributed to the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is not a washing from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> are said to "cleanse," inasmuch as they remove the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> from the body of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, or prepare them by their pious admonitions for the reception of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. In like manner also <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are said to "enlighten" <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> people, not indeed by giving them <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but by conferring on them the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> explains (Coel. Hier. v).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> which are said in giving the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, are offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not on the part of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, but on the part of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse19">Matthew 18:19</a>: "If two of you shall consent upon earth, concerning anything whatsoever they shall ask, it shall be done to them by My Father." Nor is there any reason why the devotion of a just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should not contribute to this effect. But that which is the sacramental effect is not impetrated by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> or of the minister, but through the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, the power of which operates in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, as stated above (Question 62, Article 5). Wherefore the sacramental effect is made no better by a better minister. And yet something in addition may be impetrated for the receiver of the sacrament through the devotion of the minister: but this is not the work of the minister, but the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who hears the minister's <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Inanimate things do not produce the sacramental effect, except instrumentally, as stated above. In like manner neither do men produce the sacramental effect, except ministerially, as also stated above.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the sacraments are instituted by God alone?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are not instituted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. For those things which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has instituted are delivered to us in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Scripture</a>. But in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> certain things are done which are nowhere mentioned in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Scripture</a>; for instance, the chrism with which men are confirmed, the oil with which <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are anointed, and many others, both words and actions, which we employ in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> were not instituted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is a kind of sign. Now sensible things have their own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> signification. Nor can it be said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> takes pleasure in certain significations and not in others; because He approves of all that He made. Moreover, it seems to be peculiar to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> to be enticed to something by means of signs; for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xxi): "The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are enticed . . . by means of creatures, which were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> not by them but by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by various means of attraction according to their various <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, not as an animal is enticed by food, but as a spirit is drawn by a sign." It seems, therefore, that there is no need for the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> to be instituted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> vicegerents on earth: hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse10">2 Corinthians 2:10</a>): "For what I have pardoned, if I have pardoned anything, for your sakes have I done it in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>," i.e. as though <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself had pardoned. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and their successors can institute new <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The institutor of anything is he who gives it strength and power: as in the case of those who institute laws. But the power of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, as we have shown above (1; 62, 1). Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone can institute a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As appears from what has been said above (1; 62, 1), the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are instrumental <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> effects. Now an instrument has its power from the principal agent. But an agent in respect of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is twofold; viz. he who institutes the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and he who makes use of the sacrament instituted, by applying it for the production of the effect. Now the power of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> cannot be from him who makes use of the sacrament: because he works but as a minister. Consequently, it follows that the power of the sacrament is from the institutor of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Since, therefore, the power of the sacrament is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, it follows that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone can institute the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Human</a> institutions observed in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the sacrament; but belong to the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> which is added to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> in order to arouse devotion and reverence in the recipients. But those things that are <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, are instituted by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself, Who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. And though they are not all handed down by the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, yet the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> holds them from the intimate tradition of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, according to the saying of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse34">1 Corinthians 11:34</a>): "The rest I will set in order when I come."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> From their very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> sensible things have a certain aptitude for the signifying of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> effects: but this aptitude is fixed by the Divine institution to some special signification. This is what <a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugh of St. Victor</a> means by saying (De Sacram. i) that "a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> owes its signification to its institution." Yet <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> chooses certain things rather than others for sacramental signification, not as though His choice were restricted to them, but in order that their signification be more suitable to them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and their successors are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> vicars in governing the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which is built on <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Wherefore, just as they may not institute another Church, so neither may they deliver another <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, nor institute other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>: on the contrary, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is said to be built up with the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> "which flowed from the side of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> while hanging on the Cross."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether Christ as man had the power of producing the inward sacramental effect?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had the power of producing the interior sacramental effect. For <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a> said (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse33">John 1:33</a>): "He, Who sent me to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> in water, said to me: He upon Whom thou shalt see the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> descending and remaining upon Him, He it is that baptizeth with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." But to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is to confer inwardly the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> descended upon <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, not as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: for thus He Himself gives the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, had the power of producing the inward sacramental effect.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse6">Matthew 9:6</a>): "That you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> hath power on earth to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." But forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is an inward sacramental effect. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> produces the inward sacramental effect.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the institution of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> belongs to him who acts as principal agent in producing the inward sacramental effect. Now it is clear that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> instituted the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Therefore it is He that produces the inward sacramental effect.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, no one can confer the sacramental effect without conferring the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, except he produce the sacramental effect by his own power. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> conferred the sacramental effect without conferring the sacrament; as in the case of <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Magdalen</a> to whom He said: "Thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven Thee" (<a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse48">Luke 7:48</a>). Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, produces the inward sacramental effect.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the principal agent in <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> the inward effect is that in virtue of which the sacrament operates. But the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> derive their power from <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> and through the invocation of <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">His Name</a>; according to <a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse13">1 Corinthians 1:13</a>: "Was <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> then crucified for you? or were you <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>?" Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, produces the inward sacramental effect.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (<a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a>, Etym. vi) says: "The Divine power in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> works inwardly in producing their salutary effect." Now the Divine power is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> produces the inward sacramental effect, not as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> but as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> produces the inward sacramental effect, both as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but not in the same way. For, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He works in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> by authority: but, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, His operation conduces to the inward sacramental effects meritoriously and efficiently, but instrumentally. For it has been stated (48, 1,6; 49, 1) that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> which belongs to Him in respect of His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>, both meritoriously and efficiently, not as the principal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> thereof, or by His own authority, but as an instrument, in so far as His humanity is the instrument of His Godhead, as stated above (13, 2,3; 19, 1).

<p>Nevertheless, since it is an instrument united to the Godhead in unity of Person, it has a certain headship and efficiency in regard to extrinsic instruments, which are the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> themselves, as has been explained above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Consequently, just as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has power of "authority" over the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, so, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, He has the power of ministry in chief, or power of "excellence." And this consists in four things. First in this, that the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> and power of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> operates in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, as stated above (Question 62, Article 5). And because the power of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> is communicated to us by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse25">Romans 3:25</a>: "Whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath proposed to be a propitiation through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in His blood," which <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> we proclaim by calling on the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name of Christ</a>: therefore, secondly, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> power of excellence over the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> consists in this, that they are sanctified by the invocation of His name. And because the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> derive their power from their institution, hence, thirdly, the excellence of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> power consists in this, that He, Who gave them their power, could institute the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. And since <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> does not depend on effect, but rather conversely, it belongs to the excellence of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> power, that He could bestow the sacramental effect without conferring the exterior sacrament. Thus it is clear how to solve the objections; for the arguments on either side are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to a certain extent, as explained above.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether Christ could communicate to ministers the power which He had in the sacraments?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> could not communicate to ministers the power which He had in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. For as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> argues against Maximin, "if He could, but would not, He was jealous of His power." But jealousy was far from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Who had the fulness of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Since, therefore, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not communicate His power to ministers, it seems that He could not.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, on <a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse12">John 14:12</a>: "Greater than these shall he do," <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. lxxii): "I affirm this to be altogether greater," namely, for a man from being ungodly to be made righteous, "than to create <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> could not communicate to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> the power of creating <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth: neither, therefore, could He give them the power of making the ungodly to be righteous. Since, therefore, the justification of the ungodly is effected by the power that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, it seems that He could not communicate that power to ministers.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it belongs to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> should flow from Him to others, according to <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse16">John 1:16</a>: "Of His fulness we all have received." But this could not be communicated to others; since then the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> would be deformed, having many heads. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> could not communicate His power to ministers.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> on <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse31">John 1:31</a>: "I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him not," <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. v) that "he did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> having the authority of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> . . . would keep it to Himself." But John would not have been in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of this, if such a power were incommunicable. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> could communicate His power to ministers.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had a twofold power in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. one was the power of "authority," which belongs to Him as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and this power He could not communicate to any creature; just as neither could He communicate the Divine Essence. The other was the power of "excellence," which belongs to Him as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. This power He could communicate to ministers; namely, by giving them such a fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>--that their <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> would conduce to the sacramental effect--that by the invocation of their names, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> would be sanctified--and that they themselves might institute <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and by their mere will confer the sacramental effect without observing the sacramental rite. For a united instrument, the more powerful it is, is all the more able to lend its power to the separated instrument; as the hand can to a stick.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It was not through jealousy that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> refrained from communicating to ministers His power of excellence, but for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the faithful; lest they should put their trust in men, and lest there should be various kinds of <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, giving rise to division in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; as may be seen in those who said: "I am of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, I am of Apollo, and I of <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Cephas</a>" (<a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 1:12</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This objection is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the power of authority, which belongs to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. At the same time the power of excellence can be called authority in comparison to other ministers. Whence on <a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse13">1 Corinthians 1:13</a>: "Is Christ divided?" the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says that "He could give power of authority in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>, to those to whom He gave the power of administering it."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It was in order to avoid the incongruity of many heads in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was unwilling to communicate to ministers His power of excellence. If, however, He had done so, He would have been Head in chief; the others in subjection to Him.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the sacraments can be conferred by evil ministers?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> cannot be conferred by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> ministers. For the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> are ordained for the purpose of cleansing from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and for the bestowal of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men, being themselves <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>, cannot cleanse others from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/sir034.htm#verse4">Sirach 34:4</a>: "Who [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'What'] can be made clean by the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>?" Moreover, since they have not <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, it seems that they cannot give <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, for "no one gives what he has not." It seems, therefore, that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> cannot be conferred by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, all the power of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> is derived from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as stated above (3; 62, 5). But <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men are cut off from Christ: because they have not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, by which the members are united to their Head, according to <a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse16">1 John 4:16</a>: "He that abideth in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, abideth in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in him." Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> cannot be conferred by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if anything is wanting that is required for the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, the sacrament is invalid; for instance, if the required <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> or form be wanting. But the minister required for a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is one who is without the stain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/lev021.htm#verse17">Leviticus 21:17-18</a>: "Whosoever of thy seed throughout their families, hath a blemish, he shall not offer bread to his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, neither shall he approach to minister to Him." Therefore it seems that if the minister be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, the sacrament has no effect.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says on <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse33">John 1:33</a>: "He upon Whom thou shalt see the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>," etc. (Tract. v in Joan.), that "John did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>, having the authority of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>, would keep it to Himself, but that the ministry would certainly pass to both <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men . . . What is a bad minister to thee, where the Lord is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>?"

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> work instrumentally in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, because, in a way, a minister is of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an instrument. But, as stated above (62, 1,4), an instrument acts not by reason of its own form, but by the power of the one who moves it. Consequently, whatever form or power an instrument has in addition to that which it has as an instrument, is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to it: for instance, that a physician's body, which is the instrument of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, wherein is his medical art, be healthy or sickly; or that a pipe, through which water passes, be of silver or lead. Therefore the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> can confer the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, though they be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> do not by their own power cleanse from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> those who approach the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, nor do they confer <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> on them: it is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Who does this by His own power while He employs them as instruments. Consequently, those who approach the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> receive an effect whereby they are enlikened not to the ministers but to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> members are united to their Head by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, so that they may receive life from Him; for as it is written (<a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse14">1 John 3:14</a>): "He that loveth not abideth in death." Now it is possible for a man to work with a lifeless instrument, and separated from him as to bodily union, provided it be united to him by some sort of motion: for a workman works in one way with his hand, in another with his axe. Consequently, it is thus that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> works in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, both by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men as lifeless instruments, and by <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> men as living instruments.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A thing is required in a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> in two ways. First, as being <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to it: and if this be wanting, the sacrament is invalid; for instance, if the due form or <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> be wanting. Secondly, a thing is required for a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, by reason of a certain fitness. And in this way <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> ministers are required for a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether wicked men sin in administering the sacraments?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men do not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in administering the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. For just as men serve <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, so do they serve Him in works of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; whence it is written (<a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse16">Hebrews 13:16</a>): "Do not forget to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and to impart, for by such <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> favor is obtained." But the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> do not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in serving <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by works of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: indeed, they should be persuaded to do so, according to <a href="../bible/dan004.htm#verse24">Daniel 4:24</a>: "Let my counsel be acceptable" to the king; "Redeem thou thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> with <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>." Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men do not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in administering the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whoever co-operates with another in his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is also guilty of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse32">Romans 1:32</a>: "He is [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'They are'] worthy of death; not only he that commits the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but also he who consents to them that do them." But if <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> ministers <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in administering <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, those who receive <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> from them, co-operate in their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore they would <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> also; which seems unreasonable.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it seems that no one should act when in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, for thus <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would be driven to <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, as being unable to avoid <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But if the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> were to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in administering <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, they would be in a state of perplexity: since sometimes they would <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> also if they did not administer <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>; for instance, when by reason of their office it is their bounden <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to do so; for it is written (<a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse16">1 Corinthians 9:16</a>): "For a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> lieth upon me: Woe is unto me if I preach not the gospel." Sometimes also on account of some danger; for instance, if a child in danger of death be brought to a sinner for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> do not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in administering the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. i) that "it is wrong for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> even to touch the symbols," i.e. the sacramental signs. And he says in the epistle to Demophilus: "It seems presumptuous for such a man," i.e. a sinner, "to lay hands on <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> things; he is neither afraid nor ashamed, all unworthy that he is, to take part in Divine things, with the thought that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not see what he sees in himself: he thinks, by <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> pretenses, to cheat Him Whom he calls his Father; he dares to utter, in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, words polluted by his infamy, I will not call them <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, over the Divine symbols."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> action consists in this, that a man "fails to act as he ought to," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> explains (Ethic. ii). Now it has been said (5, ad 3) that it is fitting for the ministers of <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> to be righteous; because ministers should be like unto their Lord, according to <a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse2">Leviticus 19:2</a>: "Be ye <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, because I . . . am <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>"; and <a href="../bible/sir010.htm#verse2">Sirach 10:2</a>: "As the judge of the people is himself, so also are his ministers." Consequently, there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by exercising the ministry of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, by conferring the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. And since this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> pertains to irreverence towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the contamination of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things, as far as the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is concerned, although <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things in themselves cannot be contaminated; it follows that such a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is mortal in its genus.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Works of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> are not made <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> by some process of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, but they belong to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of righteousness, as being in a way parts of righteousness. Consequently, when a man shows himself as a minister of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by doing works of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, if he be righteous, he will be made yet <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holier</a>; but if he be a sinner, he is thereby disposed to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. On the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> in themselves owing to their mystical <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of righteousness is required in the minister, that he may be suitable for his ministry: for which reason he acts unbecomingly and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, if while in a state of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> he attempts to fulfil that ministry.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> He who approaches a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, receives it from a minister of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, not because he is such and such a man, but because he is a minister of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Consequently, as long as the latter is tolerated in the ministry, he that receives a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> from him, does not communicate in his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but communicates with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from. whom he has his ministry. But if the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, by degrading, excommunicating, or suspending him, does not tolerate him in the ministry, he that receives a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> from him <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, because he communicates in his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who is in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not perplexed simply, if by reason of his office it be his bounden <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to minister <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>; because he can repent of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and so minister lawfully. But there is nothing unreasonable in his being perplexed, if we suppose that he wishes to remain in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>However, in a case of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> when even a lay <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> might <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, he would not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>. For it is clear that then he does not exercise the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but comes to the aid of one who is in need of his services. It is not so with the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, which are not so <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, as we shall show further on (65, 3,4; 62, 3).

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether angels can administer sacraments?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> can administer <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Because a higher minister can do whatever the lower can; thus a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> can do whatever a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> can: but not conversely. But <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are higher ministers in the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchical</a> order than any men whatsoever, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. ix). Therefore, since men can be ministers of <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, it seems that much more can <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> be.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men are likened to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> (<a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse30">Matthew 22:30</a>). But some <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, when in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, can be ministers of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>; since the sacramental character is indelible, as stated above (Question 63, Article 5). Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> too can be ministers of <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as stated above (Question 8, Article 7), the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is head of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> are his members. But <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> can be administered by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. Therefore it seems that they can be administered even by <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/heb005.htm#verse1">Hebrews 5:1</a>): "Every <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> taken from among men, is ordained for men in the things that appertain to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." But <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> whether <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or bad are not taken from among men. Therefore they are not ordained ministers in the things that appertain to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, i.e. in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (3; 62, 5), the whole power of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> flows from <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, which belongs to Him as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. And Him in their very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> men, not <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, resemble; indeed, in respect of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, He is described as being "a little lower than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>" (<a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse9">Hebrews 2:9</a>). Consequently, it belongs to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but not to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, to dispense the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and to take part in their administration.

<p>But it must be observed that as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> did not bind His power to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, so as to be unable to bestow the sacramental effect without conferring the sacrament; so neither did He bind His power to the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> so as to be unable to give <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> power to administer the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. And since <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are messengers of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; if any sacramental rite were performed by <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, it should be considered valid, because it ought to be evident that this is being done by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: for instance, certain churches are said to have been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> [See Acta S.S., September 29]. But if <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, who are "lying spirits," were to perform a sacramental rite, it should be pronounced as invalid.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> What men do in a less perfect manner, i.e. by sensible <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, which are proportionate to their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> also do, as ministers of a higher degree, in a more perfect manner, i.e. invisibly--by cleansing, enlightening, and perfecting.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> resemble the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> as to their share of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, but not as to the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: and consequently not in regard to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Wicked men do not owe their power of conferring <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> to their being members of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Consequently, it does not follow that "a fortiori" the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, their head, can do so.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether the minister's intention is required for the validity of a sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the minister's <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is not required for the validity of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. For the minister of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> works instrumentally. But the perfection of an action does not depend on the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the instrument, but on that of the principal agent. Therefore the minister's <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the perfecting of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to another. Therefore if the minister's <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> were required for the validity of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, he who approaches a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> could not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether he has received the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Consequently he could have no <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> in regard to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; the more that some <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, as we shall state further on (65, 4).

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a man's <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> cannot bear on that to which he does not attend. But sometimes ministers of <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> do not attend to what they say or do, through thinking of something else. Therefore in this respect the sacrament would be invalid through want of <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> What is unintentional happens by chance. But this cannot be said of the sacramental operation. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> require the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the minister.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> When a thing is indifferent to many uses, it must needs be determined to one, if that one has to be effected. Now those things which are done in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, can be done with various intent; for instance, washing with water, which is done in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, may be ordained to bodily cleanliness, to the health of the body, to amusement, and many other similar things. Consequently, it needs to be determined to one purpose, i.e. the sacramental effect, by the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of him who washes. And this <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is expressed by the words which are pronounced in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>; for instance the words, "I <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> thee in the name of the Father," etc.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> An inanimate instrument has no <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> regarding the effect; but instead of the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> there is the motion whereby it is moved by the principal agent. But an animate instrument, such as a minister, is not only moved, but in a sense moves itself, in so far as by his will he moves his bodily members to act. Consequently, his <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is required, whereby he subjects himself to the principal agent; that is, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that he intend to do that which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> do.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> On this point there are two opinions. For some hold that the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the minister is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>; in the absence of which the sacrament is invalid: and that this defect in the case of children who have not the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of approaching the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, is made <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who baptizes inwardly: whereas in adults, who have that <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, this defect is made <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and devotion.

<p>This might be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> enough of the ultimate effect, i.e. justification from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; but as to that effect which is both real and sacramental, viz. the character, it does not appear possible for it to be made <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by the devotion of the recipient, since a character is never imprinted save by a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p>Consequently, others with better reason hold that the minister of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> acts in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, whose minister he is; while in the words uttered by him, the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is expressed; and that this suffices for the validity of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, except the contrary be expressed on the part either of the minister or of the recipient of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although he who thinks of something else, has no actual <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, yet he has <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, which suffices for the validity of the sacrament; for instance if, when a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> goes to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> someone, he intends to do to him what the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does. Wherefore if subsequently during the exercise of the act his mind be distracted by other matters, the sacrament is valid in virtue of his original intention. Nevertheless, the minister of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> should take great care to have actual <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>. But this is not entirely in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> power, because when a man wishes to be very intent on something, he begins unintentionally to think of other things, according to <a href="../bible/psa039.htm#verse18">Psalm 39:18</a>: "My heart hath forsaken me."

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether faith is required of necessity in the minister of a sacrament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is required of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> in the minister of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. For, as stated above (<a href="#8">Article 8</a>), the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the minister is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the validity of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. But "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> directs in <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>" as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says against Julian (In Psalm xxxi, cf. Contra Julian iv). Therefore, if the minister is without the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the sacrament is invalid.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if a minister of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, it seems that he is a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>. But <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, seemingly, cannot confer <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. For <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> says in an epistle against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> (lxxiii): "Everything whatsoever <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> do, is carnal, void and counterfeit, so that nothing that they do should receive our approval." And Pope Leo says in his epistle to Leo Augustus (clvi): "It is a matter of <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notoriety</a> that the light of all the heavenly <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> is extinguished in the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">see of Alexandria</a>, by an act of dire and senseless cruelty. The sacrifice is no longer offered, the chrism is no longer <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, all the mysteries of religion have fled at the touch of the parricide hands of ungodly men." Therefore a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> requires of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> that the minister should have the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, those who have not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> seem to be separated from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>: for it is written in the <a href="../bible/2jo001.htm#verse10">second canonical epistle of John (10)</a>: "If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> come to you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into the house, nor say to him; <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> speed you": and (<a href="../bible/tit003.htm#verse10">Titus 3:10</a>): "A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that is a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, after the first and second admonition avoid." But it seems that an <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> cannot confer a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: since he is separated from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to whose ministry the dispensation of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> belongs. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> requires of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> that the minister should have the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says against the Donatist Petilian: "Remember that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> lives of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men are not prejudicial to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, by rendering them either invalid or less <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>), since the minister works instrumentally in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, he acts not by his own but by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> power. Now just as <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> belongs to a man's own power so also does <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Wherefore, just as the validity of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> does not require that the minister should have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and even sinners can confer <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, as stated above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>); so neither is it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that he should have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and even an unbeliever can confer a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sacrament, provided that the other essentials be there.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It may happen that a man's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is defective in regard to something else, and not in regard to the reality of the sacrament which he confers: for instance, he may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that it is unlawful to swear in any case whatever, and yet he may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is an efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. And thus such unbelief does not hinder the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of conferring the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. But if his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> be defective in regard to the very sacrament that he confers, although he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that no inward effect is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the thing done outwardly, yet he does <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Church intends to confer a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> by that which is outwardly done. Wherefore, his unbelief notwithstanding, he can intend to do what the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does, albeit he esteem it to be nothing. And such an <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> suffices for a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>: because as stated above (8, ad 2) the minister of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> acts in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> any defect in the minister's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is made <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Some <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in conferring <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> do not observe the form prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: and these confer neither the sacrament nor the reality of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. But some do observe the form prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: and these confer indeed the sacrament but not the reality. I say this in the supposition that they are outwardly cut off from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; because from the very fact that anyone receives the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> from them, he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and consequently is hindered from receiving the effect of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Fulgentius, De Fide ad Pet.) says: "Be well assured and have no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> whatever that those who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, unless they come back to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, will reap disaster from their <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>." In this sense Pope Leo says that "the light of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> was extinguished in the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Church of Alexandria</a>"; viz. in regard to the reality of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, not as to the sacrament itself.

<p><a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>, however, thought that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> do not confer even the sacrament: but in this respect we do not follow his opinion. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De unico Baptismo xiii): "Though the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> refused to recognize <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> conferred by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> or schismatics, yet so great are his <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, culminating in the crown of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, that the light of his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> dispels the darkness of his fault, and if anything needed pruning, the sickle of his passion cut it off."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The power of administering the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> character which is indelible, as explained above (63, 3). Consequently, if a man be suspended by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> or degraded, he does not lose the power of conferring <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, but the permission to use this power. Wherefore he does indeed confer the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in so doing. He also <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that receives a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> from such a man: so that he does not receive the reality of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, unless <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> excuses him.

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether the validity of a sacrament requires a good intention in the minister?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the validity of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> requires a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> in the minister. For the minister's <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> should be in conformity with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, as explained above (8, ad 1). But the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is always <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore the validity of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> requires of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> in the minister.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a perverse <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> seems worse than a playful one. But a playful <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> destroys a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>: for instance, if someone were to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> anybody not seriously but in fun. Much more, therefore, does a perverse <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> destroy a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>: for instance, if somebody were to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> a man in order to kill him afterwards.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a perverse <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> vitiates the whole work, according to <a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse34">Luke 11:34</a>: "If thy eye be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, thy" whole "body will be darksome." But the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> cannot be contaminated by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men; as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says against Petilian (Cont. Litt. Petil ii). Therefore it seems that, if the minister's <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is perverse, the sacrament is invalid.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A perverse <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> belongs to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of the minister. But the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of the minister does not annul the sacrament: neither, therefore, does his perverse <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The minister's <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> may be perverted in two ways. First in regard to the sacrament: for instance, when a man does not intend to confer a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but to make a mockery of it. Such a perverse <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> takes away the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, especially if it be manifested outwardly.

<p>Secondly, the minister's <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> may be perverted as to something that follows the sacrament: for instance, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> may intend to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> so as to be able to abuse her; or to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, so as to use it for sorcery. And because that which comes first does not depend on that which follows, consequently such a perverse <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> does not annul the sacrament; but the minister himself <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> grievously in having such an <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The Church has a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> both as to the validity of the sacrament and as to the use thereof: but it is the former <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> that perfects the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, while the latter conduces to the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> effect. Consequently, the minister who conforms his <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as to the former rectitude, but not as to the latter, perfects the sacrament indeed, but gains no <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> for himself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of mimicry or fun excludes the first kind of right <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the validity of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Consequently, there is no comparison.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A perverse <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> perverts the action of the one who has such an <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, not the action of another. Consequently, the perverse <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the minister perverts the sacrament in so far as it is his action: not in so far as it is the action of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Whose minister he is. It is just as if the servant [minister] of some <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> were to carry <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> to the poor with a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, whereas his master had commanded him with a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> to do so.
