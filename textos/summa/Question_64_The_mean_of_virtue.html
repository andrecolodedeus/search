<h1>Question 64. The mean of virtue</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2064.htm#article1"> Does moral virtue observe the mean?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2064.htm#article2"> Is the mean of moral virtue the real mean or the rational mean?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2064.htm#article3"> Do the intellectual virtues observe the mean?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2064.htm#article4"> Do the theological virtues?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether moral virtues observe the mean?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> does not observe the mean. For the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a mean is incompatible with that which is extreme. Now the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is to be something extreme; for it is stated in De Coelo i that "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is the limit of power." Therefore moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> does not observe the mean.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the maximum is not a mean. Now some moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> tend to a maximum: for instance, magnanimity to very great honors, and magnificence to very large expenditure, as stated in Ethic. iv, 2,3. Therefore not every moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> observes the mean.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to observe the mean, it follows that a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not perfected, but the contrary corrupted, through tending to something extreme. Now some moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are perfected by tending to something extreme; thus <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, which abstains from all sexual pleasure, observes the extreme, and is the most perfect <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>: and to give all to the poor is the most perfect mercy or liberality. Therefore it seems that it is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that it should observe the mean.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 6) that "moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of choosing the mean."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As already explained (55, 3), the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is that it should direct <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is properly a perfection of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in regard to some determinate <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: and the measure or rule of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> movement in respect of appetible objects is the reason. But the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of that which is measured or ruled consists in its conformity with its rule: thus the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things made by art is that they follow the rule of art. Consequently, in things of this sort, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> consists in discordance from their rule or measure. Now this may happen either by their exceeding the measure or by their falling short of it; as is clearly the case in all things ruled or measured. Hence it is evident that the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> consists in conformity with the rule of reason. Now it is clear that between excess and deficiency the mean is equality or conformity. Therefore it is evident that moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> observes the mean.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> derives <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> from the rule of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, while its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> consists in <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> or operations. If therefore we compare moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to reason, then, if we look at that which is has of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, it holds the position of one extreme, viz. conformity; while excess and defect take the position of the other extreme, viz. deformity. But if we consider moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in respect of its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, then it holds the position of mean, in so far as it makes the passion conform to the rule of reason. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 6) that "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as to its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, is a mean state," in so far as the rule of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is imposed on its proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: "but it is an extreme in reference to the 'best' and the 'excellent,'" viz. as to its conformity with reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In actions and <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> the mean and the extremes depend on various circumstances: hence nothing hinders something from being extreme in a particular <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> as to one circumstance, while the same thing is a mean in respect of other circumstances, through being in conformity with reason. This is the case with magnanimity and magnificence. For if we look at the absolute <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the respective objects of these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, we shall call it an extreme and a maximum: but if we consider the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> in relation to other circumstances, then it has the character of a mean: since these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> tend to this maximum in accordance with the rule of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, i.e. "where" it is right, "when" it is right, and for an "end" that is right. There will be excess, if one tends to this maximum "when" it is not right, or "where" it is not right, or for an undue "end"; and there will be deficiency if one fails to tend thereto "where" one ought, and "when" one aught. This agrees with the saying of the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iv, 3) that the "magnanimous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> observes the extreme in <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, but the mean in the right mode of his action."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The same is to be said of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> and <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> as of magnanimity. For <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> abstains from all sexual matters, and <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> from all <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, for a right end, and in a right manner, i.e. according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> word, and for the sake of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>. But if this be done in an undue manner, i.e. out of unlawful superstition, or again for vainglory, it will be in excess. And if it be not done when it ought to be done, or as it ought to be done, it is a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> by deficiency: for instance, in those who break their <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> or <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the mean of moral virtue is the real mean, or the rational mean?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the mean of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not the rational mean, but the real mean. For the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> consists in its observing the mean. Now, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as stated in Metaph. ii, text. 8, is in things themselves. Therefore the mean of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a real mean.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the reason is a power of apprehension. But moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> does not observe a mean between apprehensions, but rather a mean between operations or <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Therefore the mean of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not the rational, but the real mean.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a mean that is observed according to arithmetical or geometrical proportion is a real mean. Now such is the mean of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as stated in Ethic. v, 3. Therefore the mean of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not the rational, but the real mean.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 6) that "moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> observes the mean fixed, in our regard, by reason."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The rational mean can be understood in two ways. First, according as the mean is observed in the act itself of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, as though the very <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> were made to observe the mean: in this sense, since moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> perfects not the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, but the act of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, the mean of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not the rational mean. Secondly, the mean of reason may be considered as that which the reason puts into some particular <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. In this sense every mean of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a rational mean, since, as above stated (1), moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is said to observe the mean, through conformity with right reason.

<p>But it happens sometimes that the rational mean is also the real mean: in which case the mean of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is the real mean, for instance, in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. On the other hand, sometimes the rational mean is not the real mean, but is considered in relation to us: and such is the mean in all the other moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. The reason for this is that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is about operations, which deal with external things, wherein the right has to be established simply and absolutely, as stated above (Question 60, Article 2): wherefore the rational mean in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is the same as the real mean, in so far, to wit as <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> gives to each one his due, neither more nor less. But the other moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> deal with interior <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> wherein the right cannot be established in the same way, since men are variously situated in relation to their <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>; hence the rectitude of reason has to be established in the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, with due regard to us, who are moved in respect of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections. For the first two arguments take the rational mean as being in the very <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, while the third argues from the mean of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the intellectual virtues observe the mean?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> do not observe the mean. Because moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> observes the mean by conforming to the rule of reason. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are in reason itself, so that they seem to have no higher rule. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> do not observe the mean.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the mean of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is fixed by an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: for it is stated in Ethic. ii, 6, that "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> observes the mean appointed by reason, as a <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would appoint it." If therefore <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> also observe the mean, this mean will have to be appointed for them by another <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, so that there would be an indefinite series of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a mean is, properly speaking, between contraries, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> explains (Metaph. x, text. 22,23). But there seems to be no contrariety in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; since contraries themselves, as they are in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, are not in opposition to one another, but are understood together, as white and black, healthy and sick. Therefore there is no mean in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Art is an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and yet there is a mean in art (Ethic. ii, 6). Therefore also <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> observes the mean.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of anything consists in its observing the mean, by conforming with a rule or measure in respect of which it may happen to be excessive or deficient, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Now <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, like moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, is directed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as stated above (Question 56, Article 3). Hence the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> consists in observing the mean, in so far as it is subject to a measure. Now the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; in the case of contemplative <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, it is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> taken absolutely (Ethic. vi, 2); in the case of practical <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, it is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in conformity with a right <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p>Now <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> apprehended by our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, if we consider it absolutely, is measured by things; since things are the measure of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as stated in Metaph. x, text. 5; because there is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in what we think or say, according as the thing is so or not. Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> consists in a certain mean, by way of conformity with things themselves, in so far as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> expresses them as being what they are, or as not being what they are not: and it is in this that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> consists. There will be excess if something <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> is affirmed, as though something were, which in reality it is not: and there will be deficiency if something is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> denied, and declared not to be, whereas in reality it is.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, if we consider it in relation to things, is by way of that which is measured; so that both in practical and in speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, the mean consists in conformity with things. But if we consider it in relation to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, it has the character of a rule and measure. Consequently the rectitude of reason is the mean of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and also the mean of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>--of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> as ruling and measuring, of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as ruled and measured by that mean. In like manner the difference between excess and deficiency is to be applied in both cases.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">Intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> also have their measure, as stated, and they observe the mean according as they conform to that measure.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> There is no need for an indefinite series of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: because the measure and rule of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not another kind of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but things themselves.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The things themselves that are contrary have no contrariety in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, because one is the reason for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the other: nevertheless there is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> contrariety of affirmation and negation, which are contraries, as stated at the end of Peri Hermenias. For though "to be" and "not to be" are not in contrary, but in contradictory opposition to one another, so long as we consider their signification in things themselves, for on the one hand we have "being" and on the other we have simply "non-being"; yet if we refer them to the act of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, there is something positive in both cases. Hence "to be" and "not to be" are contradictory: but the opinion stating that "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" is contrary to the opinion stating that "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>": and between two such contraries <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> observes the mean.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the theological virtues observe the mean?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> observes the mean. For the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> consists in their observing the mean. Now the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> surpass the others in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Therefore much more does theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> observe the mean.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the mean of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> depends on the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> being ruled by reason; while the mean of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> consists in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> being measured by things. Now theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> perfects both <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, as stated above (Question 62, Article 3). Therefore theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> also observes the mean.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, hope, which is a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, is a mean between <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> and presumption. Likewise <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> holds a middle course between contrary <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> states (De Duab. Natur. vii): thus, by confessing one Person and two natures in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, we observe the mean between the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, who maintained the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Eutyches, who held to one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and one <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> observes the mean.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Wherever <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> observes the mean it is possible to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by excess as well as by deficiency. But there is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> by excess against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is the object of theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: for it is written (<a href="../bible/sir043.htm#verse33">Sirach 43:33</a>): "Blessing the Lord, exalt Him as much as you can: for He is above all praise." Therefore theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> does not observe the mean.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), the mean of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> depends on conformity with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue's</a> rule or measure, in so far as one may exceed or fall short of that rule. Now the measure of theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> may be twofold. One is taken from the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and thus the measure and rule of theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself: because our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is ruled according to Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, according to His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>; hope, according to the immensity of His omnipotence and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> kindness. This measure surpasses all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> power: so that never can we love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as much as He ought to be loved, nor <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and hope in Him as much as we should. Much less therefore can there be excess in such things. Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of such <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> does not consist in a mean, but increases the more we approach to the summit.

<p>The other rule or measure of theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is by comparison with us: for although we cannot be borne towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as much as we ought, yet we should approach to Him by <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a>, hoping and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a>, according to the measure of our <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>. Consequently it is possible to find a mean and extremes in theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> and in reference to us.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> consists in a mean of reason by conformity with a measure that may be exceeded: whereas this is not so in the case of theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, considered in itself, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Moral and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> perfect our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> in relation to a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> measure and rule; whereas the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> perfect them in relation to an uncreated rule and measure. Wherefore the comparison fails.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Hope observes the mean between presumption and <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, in relation to us, in so far, to wit, as a man is said to be presumptuous, through hoping to receive from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in excess of his <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>; or to <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> through failing to hope for that which according to his <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> he might hope for. But there can be no excess of hope in comparison with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Whose <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. In like manner <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> holds a middle course between contrary <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, not by comparison with its object, which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in Whom we cannot <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> too much; but in so far as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> opinion itself takes a middle position between contrary opinions, as was explained above.
