<h1>Question 65. Other injuries committed on the person</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3065.htm#article1"> The mutilation of members</a> <li><a href="../summa/3065.htm#article2"> Blows</a> <li><a href="../summa/3065.htm#article3"> Imprisonment</a> <li><a href="../summa/3065.htm#article4"> Are the sins that consist in inflicting such like injuries aggravated through being perpetrated on persons connected with others?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether in some cases it may be lawful to maim anyone?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in no case can it be lawful to maim anyone. For <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iv, 20) that "<a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> consists in departing from what is according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, towards that which is contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." Now according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> it is appointed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that a man's body should be entire in its members, and it is contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that it should be deprived of a member. Therefore it seems that it is always a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to maim a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as the whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is to the whole body, so are the parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the parts of the body (De Anima ii, 1). But it is unlawful to deprive a man of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by killing him, except by public authority. Therefore neither is it lawful to maim anyone, except perhaps by public authority.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the welfare of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is to be preferred to the welfare of the body. Now it is not lawful for a man to maim himself for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> welfare: since the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">council of Nicea</a> [P. I, sect. 4, can. i] punished those who castrated themselves that they might preserve <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. Therefore it is not lawful for any other reason to maim a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/exo021.htm#verse24">Exodus 21:24</a>): "Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since a member is part of the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, it is for the sake of the whole, as the imperfect for the perfect. Hence a member of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body is to be disposed of according as it is expedient for the body. Now a member of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body is of itself useful to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the whole body, yet, <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> it may happen to be hurtful, as when a decayed member is a source of corruption to the whole body. Accordingly so long as a member is healthy and retains its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> disposition, it cannot be cut off without injury to the whole body. But as the whole of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is directed as to his end to the whole of the community of which he is a part, as stated above (61, 1; 64, 2,5), it may happen that although the removal of a member may be detrimental to the whole body, it may nevertheless be directed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the community, in so far as it is applied to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> as a punishment for the purpose of restraining <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Hence just as by public authority a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is lawfully deprived of life altogether on account of certain more heinous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, so is he deprived of a member on account of certain lesser <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But this is not lawful for a private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, even with the consent of the owner of the member, because this would involve an injury to the community, to whom the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and all his parts belong. If, however, the member be decayed and therefore a source of corruption to the whole body, then it is lawful with the consent of the owner of the member, to cut away the member for the welfare of the whole body, since each one is entrusted with the care of his own welfare. The same applies if it be done with the consent of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> whose business it is to care for the welfare of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who has a decayed member: otherwise it is altogether unlawful to maim anyone.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Nothing prevents that which is contrary to a particular <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> from being in harmony with universal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: thus death and corruption, in the physical order, are contrary to the particular <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the thing corrupted, although they are in keeping with universal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. On like manner to maim anyone, though contrary to the particular <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the body of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> maimed, is nevertheless in keeping with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> in relation to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The life of the entire <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not directed to something belonging to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; on the contrary whatever belongs to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is directed to his life. Hence in no case does it pertain to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to take anyone's life, except to the public authority to whom is entrusted the procuring of the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But the removal of a member can be directed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and consequently in certain cases can pertain to him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A member should not be removed for the sake of the bodily health of the whole, unless otherwise nothing can be done to further the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the whole. Now it is always possible to further one's <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> welfare otherwise than by cutting off a member, because <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is always subject to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: and consequently in no case is it allowable to maim oneself, even to avoid any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> whatever. Hence <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>, in his exposition on <a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse12">Matthew 19:12</a> (Hom. lxii in Matth.), "There are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>," says: "Not by maiming themselves, but by destroying <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thoughts, for a man is <a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">accursed</a> who maims himself, since they are murderers who do such things." And further on he says: "Nor is <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> tamed thereby, on the contrary it becomes more importunate, for the seed springs in us from other sources, and chiefly from an incontinent purpose and a careless mind: and <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> is curbed not so much by cutting off a member as by curbing one's thoughts."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether it is lawful for parents to strike their children, or masters their slaves?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem unlawful for parents to strike their children, or masters their slaves. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse4">Ephesians 6:4</a>): "You, fathers, provoke not your children to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>"; and further on (<a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse6">Ephesians 6:6</a>): "And you, masters, do the same thing to your slaves [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'to them'] forbearing threatenings." Now some are provoked to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> by blows, and become more troublesome when threatened. Therefore neither should parents strike their children, nor masters their slaves.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. x, 9) that "a father's words are admonitory and not coercive." Now blows are a kind of coercion. Therefore it is unlawful for parents to strike their children.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, everyone is allowed to impart correction, for this belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsdeeds</a>, as stated above (Question 32, Article 2). If, therefore, it is lawful for parents to strike their children for the sake of correction, for the same reason it will be lawful for any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to strike anyone, which is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Therefore the same conclusion follows.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/pro013.htm#verse24">Proverbs 13:24</a>): "He that spareth the rod hateth his son," and further on (<a href="../bible/pro023.htm#verse13">Proverbs 23:13</a>): "Withhold not correction from a child, for if thou strike him with the rod, he shall not die. Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and deliver his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>." Again it is written (<a href="../bible/sir033.htm#verse28">Sirach 33:28</a>): "Torture and fetters are for a malicious <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Harm is done a body by striking it, yet not so as when it is maimed: since maiming destroys the body's integrity, while a blow merely affects the sense with pain, wherefore it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> much less harm than cutting off a member. Now it is unlawful to do a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> a harm, except by way of punishment in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Again, no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> punishes another, except one who is subject to his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Therefore it is not lawful for a man to strike another, unless he have some power over the one whom he strikes. And since the child is subject to the power of the parent, and the <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> to the power of his master, a parent can lawfully strike his child, and a master his <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> that instruction may be enforced by correction.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is a desire for vengeance, it is aroused chiefly when a man deems himself <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> injured, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Rhet. ii). Hence when parents are forbidden to provoke their children to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, they are not prohibited from striking their children for the purpose of correction, but from inflicting blows on them without moderation. The command that masters should forbear from threatening their slaves may be understood in two ways. First that they should be slow to threaten, and this pertains to the moderation of correction; secondly, that they should not always carry out their threats, that is that they should sometimes by a merciful forgiveness temper the judgment whereby they threatened punishment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The greater power should exercise the greater coercion. Now just as a city is a perfect community, so the governor of a city has perfect coercive power: wherefore he can inflict irreparable punishments such as death and mutilation. On the other hand the father and the master who preside over the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> household, which is an imperfect community, have imperfect coercive power, which is exercised by inflicting lesser punishments, for instance by blows, which do not inflict irreparable harm.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is lawful for anyone to impart correction to a willing subject. But to impart it to an unwilling subject belongs to those only who have charge over him. To this pertains chastisement by blows.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether it is lawful to imprison a man?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem unlawful to imprison a man. An act which deals with undue <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in its genus, as stated above (I-II, 18, 2). Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, having a <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, is undue <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> for imprisonment which is inconsistent with <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. Therefore it is unlawful to imprison a man.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> should be ruled by Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Now according to <a href="../bible/sir015.htm#verse14">Sirach 15:14</a>, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> left <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the hand of his own counsel." Therefore it seems that a man ought not to be coerced by chains or prisons.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be forcibly prevented except from doing an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>; and any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can lawfully prevent another from doing this. If, therefore, it were lawful to imprison a man, in order to restrain him from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, it would be lawful for anyone to put a man in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>; and this is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Therefore the same conclusion follows.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> We read in <a href="../bible/lev024.htm">Leviticus 24</a> that a man was imprisoned for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In the goods three things may be considered in due order. First, the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> integrity of the body, and this is injured by death or maiming. Secondly, pleasure or rest of the senses, and to this striking or anything <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> a sense of pain is opposed. Thirdly, the movement or use of the members, and this is hindered by binding or imprisoning or any kind of detention.

<p>Therefore it is unlawful to imprison or in any way detain a man, unless it be done according to the order of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, either in punishment, or as a measure of precaution against some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who abuses the power entrusted to him deserves to lose it, and therefore when a man by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> abuses the free use of his members, he becomes a fitting <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> for imprisonment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> According to the order of His wisdom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sometimes restrains a sinner from accomplishing a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/job005.htm#verse12">Job 5:12</a>: "Who bringeth to nought the designs of the malignant, so that their hand cannot accomplish what they had begun, while sometimes He allows them to do what they will." On like manner, according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, men are imprisoned, not for every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> but for certain ones.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is lawful for anyone to restrain a man for a time from doing some unlawful <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> there and then: as when a man prevents another from throwing himself over a precipice, or from striking another. But to him alone who has the right of disposing in general of the actions and of the life of another does it belong primarily to imprison or fetter, because by so doing he hinders him from doing not only <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> but also <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the sin is aggravated by the fact that the aforesaid injuries are perpetrated on those who are connected with others?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not aggravated by the fact that the aforesaid injuries are perpetrated on those who are connected with others. Such like injuries take their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> character from inflicting an injury on another against his will. Now the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> inflicted on a man's own <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is more against his will than that which is inflicted on a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> connected with him. Therefore an injury inflicted on a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> connected with another is less grievous.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> reproves those especially who do injuries to orphans and <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>: hence it is written (<a href="../bible/sir035.htm#verse17">Sirach 35:17</a>): "He will not despise the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the fatherless, nor the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> when she poureth out her complaint." Now the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> and the orphan are not connected with other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not aggravated through an injury being inflicted on one who is connected with others.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who is connected has a will of his own just as the principal <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> has, so that something may be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> for him and yet against the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the principal <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, as in the case of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> which pleases the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> but not the husband. Now these injuries are <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> in so far as they consist in an involuntary commutation. Therefore such like injuries are of a less <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/deu028.htm#verse32">Deuteronomy 28:32</a>) as though indicating an aggravating circumstance: "Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given to another people, thy eyes looking on [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'May thy sons and thy daughters be given,' etc.]."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Other things being equal, an injury is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> according as it affects more <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; and hence it is that it is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to strike or injure a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in authority than a private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, because it conduces to the injury of the whole community, as stated above (I-II, 73, 09). Now when an injury is inflicted on one who is connected in any way with another, that injury affects two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, so that, other things being equal, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is aggravated by this very fact. It may happen, however, that in view of certain circumstances, a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed against one who is not connected with any other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, is more grievous, on account of either the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, or the greatness of the injury.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> An injury inflicted on a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> connected with others is less harmful to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> with whom he is connected, than if it were perpetrated immediately on them, and from this point of view it is a less grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But all that belongs to the injury of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> with whom he is connected, is added to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of which a man is guilty through injuring the other one in himself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Injuries done to <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> and orphans are more insisted upon both through being more opposed to mercy, and because the same injury done to such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is more grievous to them since they have no one to turn to for relief.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The fact that the wife <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> consents to the <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, lessens the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and injury, so far as the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is concerned, for it would be more grievous, if the adulterer oppressed her by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. But this does not remove the injury as affecting her husband, since "the wife hath not power of her own body; but the husband" (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse4">1 Corinthians 7:4</a>). The same applies to similar cases. of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, however, as it is opposed not only to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> but also to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, we shall speak in the treatise on Temperance (154, 8).
