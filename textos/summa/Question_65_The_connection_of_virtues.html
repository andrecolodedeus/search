<h1>Question 65. The connection of virtues</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2065.htm#article1"> Are the moral virtues connected with one another?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2065.htm#article2"> Can the moral virtues be without charity?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2065.htm#article3"> Can charity be without them?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2065.htm#article4"> Can faith and hope be without charity?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2065.htm#article5"> Can charity be without them?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the moral virtues are connected with one another?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not connected with one another. Because moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are sometimes <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the exercise of acts, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in Ethic. ii, 1,2. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can exercise himself in the acts of one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, without exercising himself in the acts of some other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore it is possible to have one moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> without another.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, magnificence and magnanimity are moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Now a man may have other moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> without having magnificence or magnanimity: for the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 2,3) that "a poor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot be magnificent," and yet he may have other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; and (Ethic. iv) that "he who is worthy of small things, and so accounts his worth, is modest, but not magnanimous." Therefore the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not connected with one another.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> perfect the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, so do the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> perfect the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> part. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not mutually connected: since we may have one science, without having another. Neither, therefore, are the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> connected with one another.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, if the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are mutually connected, this can only be because they are united together in <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. But this does not suffice to connect the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> together. For, seemingly, one may be <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> about things to be done in relation to one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, without being <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> in those that concern another <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: even as one may have the art of making certain things, without the art of making certain others. Now <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is right reason about things to be done. Therefore the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> connected with one another.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says on <a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse20">Luke 6:20</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are connected and linked together, so that whoever has one, is seen to have several": and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. vi, 4) that "the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> that reside in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind are quite inseparable from one another": and <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxii, 1) that "one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> without the other is either of no account whatever, or very imperfect": and Cicero says (Quaest. Tusc. ii): "If you confess to not having one particular <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, it must needs be that you have none at all."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> may be considered either as perfect or as imperfect. An imperfect moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> for instance, or <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, is nothing but an inclination in us to do some kind of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, whether such inclination be in us by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or by habituation. If we take the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in this way, they are not connected: since we find men who, by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> temperament or by being accustomed, are prompt in doing <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of liberality, but are not prompt in doing <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>.

<p>But the perfect moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> that inclines us to do a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> well; and if we take moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in this way, we must say that they are connected, as nearly as all are agreed in saying. For this two reasons are given, corresponding to the different ways of assigning the distinction of the cardinal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For, as we stated above (61, A3,4), some distinguish them according to certain general properties of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: for instance, by saying that discretion belongs to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, rectitude to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, moderation to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, and strength of mind to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, in whatever <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> we consider these properties to be. In this way the reason for the connection is evident: for strength of mind is not commended as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, if it be without moderation or rectitude or discretion: and so forth. This, too, is the reason assigned for the connection by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, who says (Moral. xxii, 1) that "a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> cannot be perfect" as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, "if isolated from the others: for there can be no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> without <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>": and he continues to speak in like manner of the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> (cf. 61, 4, Objection 1). <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> also gives the same reason (De Trin. vi, 4).

<p>Others, however, differentiate these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in respect of their matters, and it is in this way that <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> assigns the reason for their connection (Ethic. vi, 13). Because, as stated above (Question 58, Article 4), no moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> can be without <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>; since it is proper to moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to make a right choice, for it is an elective <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. Now right choice requires not only the inclination to a due end, which inclination is the direct outcome of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but also correct choice of things conducive to the end, which choice is made by <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, that counsels, judges, and commands in those things that are directed to the end. In like manner one cannot have <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> unless one has the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: since <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is "right reason about things to be done," and the starting point of reason is the end of the thing to be done, to which end <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is rightly disposed by moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Hence, just as we cannot have speculative science unless we have the understanding of the principles, so neither can we have <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> without the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: and from this it follows clearly that the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are connected with one another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Some moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> perfect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as regards his general state, in other words, with regard to those things which have to be done in every kind of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life. Hence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs to exercise himself at the same time in the matters of all moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. And if he exercise himself, by <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, in all such matters, he will acquire the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of all the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. But if he exercise himself by <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> in regard to one <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but not in regard to another, for instance, by behaving well in matters of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, but not in matters of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>; he will indeed acquire a certain <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of restraining his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; but this <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> will lack the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, through the absence of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, which is wanting in matters of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. In the same way, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclinations fail to have the complete character of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, if <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> be lacking.

<p>But there are some moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which perfect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with regard to some eminent state, such as magnificence and magnanimity; and since it does not happen to all in common to be exercised in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of such <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, it is possible for a man to have the other moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, without actually having the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>--provided we speak of acquired <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Nevertheless, when once a man has acquired those other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> he possesses these in proximate <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. Because when, by practice, a man has acquired liberality in small <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> and expenditure, if he were to come in for a large sum of money, he would acquire the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of magnificence with but little practice: even as a geometrician, by dint of little study, acquires scientific <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> about some conclusion which had never been presented to his mind before. Now we speak of having a thing when we are on the point of having it, according to the saying of the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Phys. ii, text. 56): "That which is scarcely lacking is not lacking at all."

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the Second Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are about divers matters having no relation to one another, as is clearly the case with the various <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> and arts. Hence we do not observe in them the connection that is to be found among the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, which are about <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and operations, that are clearly related to one another. For all the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> have their rise in certain initial <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, viz. love and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, and terminate in certain others, viz. pleasure and sorrow. In like manner all the operations that are the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are related to one another, and to the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Hence the whole <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> falls under the one rule of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p>Nevertheless, all intelligible things are related to first principles. And in this way, all the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> depend on the understanding of principles; even as <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> depends on the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as stated. On the other hand, the universal principles which are the object of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of understanding of principles, do not depend on the conclusions, which are the objects of the other <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as do the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> depend on <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, in a fashion, moves the reason, and the reason the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, as stated above (9, 1; 58, 5, ad 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Those things to which the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> incline, are as the principles of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>: whereas the products of art are not the principles, but the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of art. Now it is evident that, though reason may be right in one part of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and not in another, yet in no way can it be called right reason, if it be deficient in any principle whatever. Thus, if a man be wrong about the principle, "A whole is greater than its part," he cannot acquire the science of geometry, because he must <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> wander from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in his conclusion. Moreover, things "done" are related to one another, but not things "made," as stated above (ad 3). Consequently the lack of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> in one department of things to be done, would result in a deficiency affecting other things to be done: whereas this does not occur in things to be made.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether moral virtues can be without charity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> can be without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For it is stated in the Liber Sentent. Prosperi vii, that "every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> save <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> may be common to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and bad." But "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> can be in none except the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," as stated in the same book. Therefore the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> can be had without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> can be acquired by means of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, as stated in Ethic. ii, 1,2, whereas <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> cannot be had otherwise than by infusion, according to <a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans 5:5</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is poured forth in our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> Who is given to us." Therefore it is possible to have the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are connected together, through depending on <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. But <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> does not depend on <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>; indeed, it surpasses <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, according to <a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse19">Ephesians 3:19</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which surpasseth all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>." Therefore the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not connected with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and can be without it.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse14">1 John 3:14</a>): "He that loveth not, abideth in death." Now the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life is perfected by the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, since it is "by them" that "we lead a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> life," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Lib. Arb. ii, 17,19). Therefore they cannot be without the love of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 63, Article 2), it is possible by means of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> works to acquire moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, in so far as they produce <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works that are directed to an end not surpassing the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: and when they are acquired thus, they can be without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, even as they were in many of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. But in so far as they produce <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works in proportion to a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> last end, thus they have the character of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> and perfectly; and cannot be acquired by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, but are infused by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Such like moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> cannot be without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For it has been stated above (1; 58, A4,5) that the other moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> cannot be without <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>; and that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> cannot be without the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, because these latter make <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> well disposed to certain ends, which are the starting-point of the procedure of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Now for <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> to proceed aright, it is much more <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be well disposed towards his ultimate end, which is the effect of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, than that he be well disposed in respect of other ends, which is the effect of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: just as in speculative matters right reason has greatest need of the first indemonstrable principle, that "contradictories cannot both be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> at the same time." It is therefore evident that neither can infused <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> be without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; nor, consequently, the other moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, since they cannot be without <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p>It is therefore clear from what has been said that only the infused <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are perfect, and deserve to be called <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> simply: since they direct <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> well to the ultimate end. But the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, those, namely, that are acquired, are <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in a restricted sense, but not simply: for they direct <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> well in respect of the last end in some particular genus of action, but not in respect of the last end simply. Hence a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [Cf. Lib. Sentent. Prosperi cvi.] on the words, "All that is not of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse23">Romans 14:23</a>), says: "He that fails to acknowledge the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, has no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, even if his conduct be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Virtue, in the words quoted, denotes imperfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Else if we take moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in its perfect state, "it makes its possessor <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," and consequently cannot be in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument holds good of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in the sense of acquired <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Though <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> surpasses science and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, yet <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> depends on <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as stated: and consequently so do all the infused moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether charity can be without moral virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem possible to have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> without the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For when one thing suffices for a certain purpose, it is superfluous to employ others. Now <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> alone suffices for the fulfilment of all the works of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as is clear from <a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse4">1 Corinthians 13:4</a>, seqq.: "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> is patient, is kind," etc. Therefore it seems that if one has <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are superfluous.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, he that has a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> easily performs the works of that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and those works are pleasing to him for their own sake: hence "pleasure taken in a work is a sign of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>" (Ethic. ii, 3). Now many have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, being free from mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and yet they find it difficult to do works of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; nor are these works pleasing to them for their own sake, but only for the sake of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore many have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> without the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is to be found in every <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>: and yet there are some <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who are without certain <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> says (on <a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse10">Luke 17:10</a>) that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are more <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a> on account of their not having certain <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, than rejoiced at the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> they have. Therefore, if a man has <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, it does not follow of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> that he has all the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The whole Law is fulfilled through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, for it is written (<a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse8">Romans 13:8</a>): "He that loveth his neighbor, hath fulfilled the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>." Now it is not possible to fulfil the whole Law, without having all the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: since the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> contains precepts about all acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated in Ethic. v, 1,2. Therefore he that has <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, has all the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Moreover, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a letter (Epis. clxvii) [Cf. Serm. xxxix and xlvi de Temp.] that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> contains all the cardinal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> All the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are infused together with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. The reason for this is that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> operates no less perfectly in works of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> than in works of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now, in the works of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, we find that whenever a thing contains a principle of certain works, it has also whatever is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for their execution: thus animals are provided with organs whereby to perform the actions that their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> empower them to do. Now it is evident that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, inasmuch as it directs <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to his last end, is the principle of all the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works that are referable to his last end. Wherefore all the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> must needs be infused together with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, since it is through them that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> performs each different kind of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work.

<p>It is therefore clear that the infused moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are connected, not only through <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, but also on account of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: and, again, that whoever loses <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> through mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, forfeits all the infused moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In order that the act of a lower power be perfect, not only must there be perfection in the higher, but also in the lower power: for if the principal agent were well disposed, perfect action would not follow, if the instrument also were not well disposed. Consequently, in order that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> work well in things referred to the end, he needs not only a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> disposing him well to the end, but also those <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which dispose him well to whatever is referred to the end: for the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which regards the end is the chief and moving principle in respect of those things that are referred to the end. Therefore it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to have the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> together with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It happens sometimes that a man who has a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, finds it difficult to act in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, and consequently feels no pleasure and complacency in the act, on account of some impediment supervening from without: thus a man who has a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of science, finds it difficult to understand, through being sleepy or unwell. In like manner sometimes the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> experience difficulty in their works, by reason of certain ordinary dispositions remaining from previous acts. This difficulty does not occur in respect of acquired moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: because the repeated acts by which they are acquired, remove also the contrary dispositions.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Certain <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are said not to have certain <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, in so far as they experience difficulty in the acts of those <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, for the reason stated; although they have the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether faith and hope can be without charity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope are never without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Because, since they are theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, they seem to be more excellent than even the infused moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. But the infused moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> cannot be without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Neither therefore can <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope be without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> unwillingly" as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. xxvi in Joan.). But <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as a perfection thereof, as stated above (Question 62, Article 3). Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> cannot be without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion viii) that "there can be no hope without love." But love is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: for it is of this love that he speaks. Therefore hope cannot be without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse2">Matthew 1:2</a> says that "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> begets hope, and hope, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>." Now the begetter precedes the begotten, and can be without it. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> can be without hope; and hope, without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> and hope, like the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, can be considered in two ways; first in an inchoate state; secondly, as complete <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For since <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is directed to the doing of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works, perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is that which gives the faculty of doing a perfectly <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work, and this consists in not only doing what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but also in doing it well. Else, if what is done is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but not well done, it will not be perfectly <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; wherefore neither will the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> that is the principle of such an act, have the perfect character of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For instance, if a man do what is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, what he does is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: but it will not be the work of a perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> unless he do it well, i.e. by choosing rightly, which is the result of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>; for which reason <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> cannot be a perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> without <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p>Accordingly <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope can <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> indeed in a fashion without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: but they have not the perfect character of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For, since the act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and since to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> is to assent to someone of one's own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>: to will not as one ought, will not be a perfect act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. To will as one ought is the outcome of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> which perfects the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: since every right movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> proceeds from a right love, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 9). Hence <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> may be without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, but not as a perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: just as <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> can be without <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. The same applies to hope. Because the act of hope consists in looking to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for future bliss. This act is perfect, if it is based on the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> which we have; and this cannot be without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. But to expect future bliss through <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> which one has not yet, but which one proposes to acquire at some future time, will be an imperfect act; and this is possible without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Consequently, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope can be without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; yet, without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, they are not <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> properly so-called; because the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> requires that by it, we should not only do what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but also that we should do it well (Ethic. ii, 6).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> depends on <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>: and not even infused <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> has the character of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; for this involves the absence of due order to the first principle, viz. the ultimate end. On the other hand <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope, as such, do not depend either on <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> or <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; so that they can be without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, although they are not <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as stated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> considered as a perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is speaking here of that hope whereby we look to gain future bliss through <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> which we have already; and this is not without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether charity can be without faith and hope?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> can be without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope. For <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But it is possible for us to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, without already having <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or hope in future bliss. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> can be without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is the root of all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, according to <a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse17">Ephesians 3:17</a>: "Rooted and founded in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>." Now the root is sometimes without branches. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> can sometimes be without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope, and the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, there was perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And yet He had neither <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> nor hope: because He was a perfect comprehensor, as we shall explain further on (TP, 7, A3,4). Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> can be without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse6">Hebrews 11:6</a>): "Without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> it is impossible to please <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>"; and this evidently belongs most to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, according to <a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse17">Proverbs 8:17</a>: "I love them that love me." Again, it is by hope that we are brought to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as stated above (Question 62, Article 4). Therefore it is not possible to have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> signifies not only the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but also a certain friendship with Him; which implies, besides love, a certain mutual return of love, together with mutual communion, as stated in Ethic. viii, 2. That this belongs to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is evident from <a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse16">1 John 4:16</a>: "He that abideth in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, abideth in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in him," and from <a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse9">1 Corinthians 1:9</a>, where it is written: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is faithful, by Whom you are called unto the fellowship of His Son." Now this fellowship of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which consists in a certain familiar colloquy with Him, is begun here, in this life, by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but will be perfected in the future life, by <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; each of which things we hold by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope. Wherefore just as friendship with a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> would be impossible, if one disbelieved in, or despaired of, the possibility of their fellowship or familiar colloquy; so too, friendship with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, is impossible without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so as to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in this fellowship and colloquy with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to hope to attain to this fellowship. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is quite impossible without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> is not any kind of love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but that love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by which He is loved as the object of bliss, to which object we are directed by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> is the root of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope, in so far as it gives them the perfection of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope as such are the precursors of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as stated above (Question 62, Article 4), and so <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is impossible without them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was neither <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> nor hope, on account of their implying an imperfection. But instead of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, He had manifest vision, and instead of hope, full comprehension [See above, 4, 3]: so that in Him was perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.
