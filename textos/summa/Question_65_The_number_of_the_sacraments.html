<h1>Question 65. The number of the sacraments</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/4065.htm#article1"> Are there seven sacraments?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4065.htm#article2"> The order of the sacraments among themselves</a> <li><a href="../summa/4065.htm#article3"> Their mutual comparison</a> <li><a href="../summa/4065.htm#article4"> Are all the sacraments necessary for salvation?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether there should be seven sacraments?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that there ought not to be seven <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> derive their efficacy from the Divine power, and the power of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>. But the Divine power is one, and <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> is one; since "by one oblation He hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified" (<a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse14">Hebrews 10:14</a>). Therefore there should be but one sacrament.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is intended as a remedy for the defect <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now this is twofold, punishment and guilt. Therefore two <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> would be enough.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> belong to the actions of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical hierarchy</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> explains (Eccl. Hier. v). But, as he says, there are three actions of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical hierarchy</a>, namely, "to cleanse, to enlighten, to perfect." Therefore there should be no more than three <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Faust. xix) that the "<a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>" of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> are "less numerous" than those of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. But in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> there was no sacrament corresponding to Confirmation and <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a>. Therefore these should not be counted among the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is not more grievous than other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as we have made clear in I-II, 74, 5; II-II, 154, 3. But there is no sacrament instituted as a remedy for other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore neither should <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> be instituted as a remedy for <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> On the other hand, It seems that there should be more than seven <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. For <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are a kind of sacred sign. But in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> there are many sanctifications by sensible signs, such as Holy Water the Consecration of Altars, and such like. Therefore there are more than seven <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 7.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugh of St. Victor</a> (De Sacram. i) says that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> were oblations, <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. But the Sacrifice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is one sacrament, called the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>. Therefore oblations also and <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> should be called <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 8.</strong> Further, there are three kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, original, mortal and venial. Now <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is intended as a remedy against <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, and Penance against mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore besides the seven <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, there should be another against venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (62, 5; 63, 1), the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were instituted for a twofold purpose: namely, in order to perfect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in things pertaining to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> according to the religion of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life, and to be a remedy against the defects <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And in either way it is becoming that there should be seven <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p>For <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life has a certain conformity with the life of the body: just as other corporeal things have a certain likeness to things <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>. Now a man attains perfection in the corporeal life in two ways: first, in regard to his own <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; secondly, in regard to the whole community of the society in which he lives, for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> a social animal. With regard to himself <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is perfected in the life of the body, in two ways; first, directly [per se, i.e. by acquiring some vital perfection; secondly, indirectly [per accidens, i.e. by the removal of hindrances to life, such as ailments, or the like. Now the life of the body is perfected "directly," in three ways. First, by generation whereby a man begins to be and to live: and corresponding to this in the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life there is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, which is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> regeneration, according to <a href="../bible/tit003.htm#verse5">Titus 3:5</a>: "By the laver of regeneration," etc. Secondly, by growth whereby a man is brought to perfect size and strength: and corresponding to this in the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life there is Confirmation, in which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is given to strengthen us. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> who were already <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> were bidden thus: "Stay you in the city till you be endued with power from on high" (<a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse49">Luke 24:49</a>). Thirdly, by nourishment, whereby life and strength are preserved to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; and corresponding to this in the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life there is the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>. Wherefore it is said (<a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse54">John 6:54</a>): "Except you eat of the flesh of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, and drink His blood, you shall not have life in you."

<p>And this would be enough for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> if he had an impassible life, both corporally and spiritually; but since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is liable at times to both corporal and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> infirmity, i.e. <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, hence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs a cure from his infirmity; which cure is twofold. one is the healing, that restores health: and corresponding to this in the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life there is Penance, according to <a href="../bible/psa040.htm#verse5">Psalm 40:5</a>: "Heal my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, for I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against Thee." The other is the restoration of former vigor by means of suitable diet and exercise: and corresponding to this in the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life there is <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a>, which removes the remainder of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and prepares <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for final <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/jam005.htm#verse15">James 5:15</a>): "And if he be in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> they shall be forgiven him."

<p>In regard to the whole community, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is perfected in two ways. First, by receiving power to rule the community and to exercise public acts: and corresponding to this in the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life there is the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacrament of order</a>, according to the saying of <a href="../bible/heb007.htm#verse27">Hebrews 7:27</a>, that <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> not for themselves only, but also for the people. Secondly in regard to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> propagation. This is accomplished by Matrimony both in the corporal and in the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life: since it is not only a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> but also a function of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p>We may likewise gather the number of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> from their being instituted as a remedy against the defect <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is intended as a remedy against the absence of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life; Confirmation, against the infirmity of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> found in those of recent birth; the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, against the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> proneness to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; Penance, against actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a>, against the remainders of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>--of those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, namely, which are not sufficiently removed by Penance, whether through negligence or through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; order, against divisions in the community; Matrimony, as a remedy against <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, and against the decrease in numbers that results from death.

<p>Some, again, gather the number of <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> from a certain adaptation to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and to the defects and penal effects resulting from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. They say that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> corresponds to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, and is ordained as a remedy against <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>; <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a>, to Hope, being ordained against venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a>, being ordained against the penal effect which is malice. order, to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">Prudence</a>, being ordained against <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; Penance to Justice, being ordained against mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; Matrimony, to Temperance, being ordained against <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>; Confirmation, to Fortitude, being ordained against infirmity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The same principal agent uses various instruments unto various effects, in accordance with the thing to be done. In the same way the Divine power and the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion of Christ</a> work in us through the various <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> as through various instruments.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Guilt and punishment are diversified both according to <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, inasmuch as there are various <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of guilt and punishment, and according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> various states and habitudes. And in this respect it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to have a number of <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, as explained above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchical</a> actions we must consider the agents, the recipients and the actions. The agents are the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and to these the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacrament of order</a> belongs. The recipients are those who approach the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>: and these are brought into being by Matrimony. The actions are "cleansing," "enlightening," and "perfecting." Mere cleansing, however, cannot be a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, which confers <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: yet it belongs to certain <a href="../cathen/13292d.htm">sacramentals</a>, i.e. catechism and exorcism. But cleansing coupled with enlightening, according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a>, belongs to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>; and, for him who falls back into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, they belong secondarily to Penance and <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a>. And perfecting, as regards power, which is, as it were, a formal perfection, belongs to Confirmation: while, as regards the attainment of the end, it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">sacrament of Confirmation</a> we receive the fulness of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> in order to be strengthened; while in <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is prepared for the immediate attainment of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; and neither of these two purposes was becoming to the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. Consequently, nothing in the old Law could correspond to these <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Nevertheless, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the old Law were more numerous, on account of the various kinds of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and ceremonies.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> There was need for a special sacrament to be applied as a remedy against venereal <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>: first because by this <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, not only the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> but also the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is defiled: secondly, by reason of its vehemence whereby it clouds the reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> Holy Water and other <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> things are not called <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, because they do not produce the sacramental effect, which is the receiving of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. They are, however, a kind of disposition to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>: either by removing obstacles. thus <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> water is ordained against the snares of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and against venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: or by making things suitable for the conferring of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; thus the altar and vessels are <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> through reverence for the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 7.</strong> Oblations and <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, both the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">Law of nature</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law of Moses</a>, ere ordained not only for the sustenance of the ministers and the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, but also figuratively; and consequently they were <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. But now they remain no longer as figures, and therefore they are not <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 8.</strong> The infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the blotting out of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Wherefore, since <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is infused in each of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, none of them was instituted directly against venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. This is taken away by certain <a href="../cathen/13292d.htm">sacramentals</a>, for instance, Holy Water and such like. Some, however, hold that <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> is ordained against venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But of this we shall speak in its proper place (XP, 30, 1).

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the order of the sacraments, as given above, is becoming?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the order of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> as given above is unbecoming. For according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse46">1 Corinthians 15:46</a>), "that was . . . first . . . which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, afterwards that which is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>." But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is begotten through Matrimony by a first and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> generation; while in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> he is regenerated as by a second and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> generation. Therefore Matrimony should precede <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, through the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacrament of order</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> receives the power of agent in sacramental actions. But the agent precedes his action. Therefore order should precede <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> and the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> food; while Confirmation is compared to growth. But food <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, and consequently precedes, growth. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> precedes Confirmation.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, Penance prepares <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>. But a disposition precedes perfection. Therefore Penance should precede the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, that which is nearer the last end comes after other things. But, of all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> is nearest to the last end which is Happiness. Therefore it should be placed last among the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The order of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, as given above, is commonly adopted by all.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The reason of the order among the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> appears from what has been said above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). For just as unity precedes multitude, so those <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which are intended for the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> precede those which are intended for the perfection of the multitude; and consequently the last place among the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> is given to order and Matrimony, which are intended for the perfection of the multitude: while Matrimony is placed after order, because it has less participation in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life, to which the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are ordained. Moreover, among things ordained to the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, those <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> come first which are ordained directly to the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life, and afterwards, those which are ordained thereto indirectly, viz. by removing some supervening <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of harm; such are Penance and <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a>: while, of these, <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> placed last, for it preserves the healing which was begun by Penance.

<p>Of the remaining three, it is clear that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> which is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> regeneration, comes first; then Confirmation, which is ordained to the formal perfection of power; and after these the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> which is ordained to final perfection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Matrimony as ordained to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> life is a function of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But in so far as it has something <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> it is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. And because it has the least amount of spirituality it is placed last.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> For a thing to be an agent it must first of all be perfect in itself. Wherefore those <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> by which a man is perfected in himself, are placed before the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacrament of order</a>, in which a man is made a perfecter of others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Nourishment both precedes growth, as its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; and follows it, as maintaining the perfection of size and power in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Consequently, the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> can be placed before Confirmation, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> places it (Eccl. Hier. iii, iv), and can be placed after it, as the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> does (iv, 2,8).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> This argument would hold if Penance were required of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> as a preparation to the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>. But this is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: for if anyone be without mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he does not need Penance in order to receive the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>. Thus it is clear that Penance is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> preparation to the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, that is to say, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> being supposed. Wherefore it is written in the <a href="../bible/2ch036.htm">last chapter of the second Book of Paralipomenon</a> (cf. <a href="../bible/2ch033.htm#verse18">2 Chronicles 33:18</a>): "Thou, O Lord of the righteous, didst not impose penance on righteous men." [The words quoted are from the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> of Manasses, which, before the Council of Trent, was to be found inserted in some <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> copies of the Bible.]

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a>, for this very reason, is given the last place among those <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which are ordained to the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the Eucharist is the greatest of the sacraments?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is not the principal of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. For the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is of more account than the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> (1 Ethic. ii). But Matrimony is ordained to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> by means of generation: whereas the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is ordained to the private <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the recipient. Therefore it is not the greatest of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, those <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, seemingly, are greater, which are conferred by a greater minister. But the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of Confirmation and order are conferred by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> only, who is a greater minister than a mere minister such as a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, by whom the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is conferred. Therefore those <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are greater.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, those <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are greater that have the greater power. But some of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> imprint a character, viz. Baptism, Confirmation and Order; whereas the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Eucharist</a> does not. Therefore those <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are greater.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, that seems to be greater, on which others depend without its depending on them. But the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Eucharist</a> depends on Baptism: since no one can receive the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Eucharist</a> except he has been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. Therefore Baptism is greater than the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Eucharist</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. iii) that "No one receives <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchical</a> perfection save by the most God-like <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>." Therefore this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is greater than all the others and perfects them.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Absolutely speaking, the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is the greatest of all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>: and this may be shown in three ways. First of all because it contains <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself substantially: whereas the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> contain a certain instrumental power which is a share of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> power, as we have shown above (62, 4, ad 3, 5). Now that which is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> such is always of more account than that which is such by participation.

<p>Secondly, this is made clear by considering the relation of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> to one another. For all the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> seem to be ordained to this one as to their end. For it is manifest that the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacrament of order</a> is ordained to the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> to the reception of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>: while a man is perfected by Confirmation, so as not to fear to abstain from this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. By Penance and <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is prepared to receive the Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> worthily. And Matrimony at least in its signification, touches this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; in so far as it signifies the union of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, of which union the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is a figure: hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse32">Ephesians 5:32</a>): "This is a great sacrament: but I speak in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>."

<p>Thirdly, this is made clear by considering the rites of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. For nearly all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> terminate in the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. iii): thus those who have been ordained receive Holy Communion, as also do those who have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, if they be adults.

<p>The remaining <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> may be compared to one another in several ways. For on the ground of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is the greatest of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>; while from the point of view of perfection, order comes first; while Confirmation holds a middle place. The <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of Penance and <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> are on a degree inferior to those mentioned above; because, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), they are ordained to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life, not directly, but <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, as it were, that is to say, as remedies against supervening defects. And among these, <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> is compared to Penance, as Confirmation to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>; in such a way, that Penance is more <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, whereas <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> is more perfect.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Matrimony is ordained to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as regards the body. But the common <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is contained substantially in the sacrament itself of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> By order and Confirmation the faithful of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> are deputed to certain special duties; and this can be done by the prince alone. Consequently the conferring of these <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> belongs exclusively to a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who is, as it were, a prince in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But a man is not deputed to any <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> by the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, rather is this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> the end of all duties, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The sacramental character, as stated above (Question 63, Article 3), is a kind of participation in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. Wherefore the sacrament that unites <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself, is greater than a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> that imprints Christ's character.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> This argument proceeds on the ground of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. For thus <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, being of the greatest <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, is the greatest of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, just as order and Confirmation have a certain excellence considered in their administration; and Matrimony by reason of its signification. For there is no reason why a thing should not be greater from a certain point of view which is not greater absolutely speaking.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether all the sacraments are necessary for salvation?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For what is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> seems to be superfluous. But no sacrament is superfluous, because "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does nothing without a purpose" (De Coelo et Mundo i). Therefore all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as it is said of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse5">John 3:5</a>): "Unless a man be born again of water and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, he cannot enter in to the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>," so of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is it said (<a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse54">John 6:54</a>): "Except you eat of the flesh of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, and drink of His blood, you shall not have life in you." Therefore, just as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> sacrament, so is the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a man can be saved without the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a>, provided that some unavoidable obstacle, and not his contempt for religion, debar him from the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as we shall state further on (68, 2). But contempt of religion in any sacrament is a hindrance to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Therefore, in like manner, all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Children are saved by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> alone without the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">Necessity</a> of end, of which we speak now, is twofold. First, a thing may be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> so that without it the end cannot be attained; thus food is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life. And this is simple <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of end. Secondly, a thing is said to be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, if, without it, the end cannot be attained so becomingly: thus a horse is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for a journey. But this is not simple <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of end.

<p>In the first way, three <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Two of them are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>; <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, simply and absolutely; Penance, in the case of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>; while the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacrament of order</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, since "where there is no governor the people shall fall" (<a href="../bible/pro011.htm#verse14">Proverbs 11:14</a>).

<p>But in the second way the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. For in a sense Confirmation perfects <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>; <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> perfects Penance; while Matrimony, by multiplying them, preserves the numbers in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> For a thing not to be superfluous it is enough if it be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> either in the first or the second way. It is thus that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> These words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> are to be understood of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, and not of merely sacramental, eating, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> explains (Tract. xxvi super Joan.).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although contempt of any of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> is a hindrance to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, yet it does not amount to contempt of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, if anyone does not trouble to receive a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> that is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Else those who do not receive orders, and those who do not contract Matrimony, would be guilty of contempt of those <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.
