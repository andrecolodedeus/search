<h1>Question 65. The work of creation of corporeal creatures</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1065.htm#article1"> Are corporeal creatures from God?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1065.htm#article2"> Were they created on account of God's goodness?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1065.htm#article3"> Were they created by God through the medium of the angels?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1065.htm#article4"> Are the forms of bodies from the angels or immediately from God?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether corporeal creatures are from God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that corporeal creatures are not from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For it is said (<a href="../bible/ecc003.htm#verse14">Ecclesiastes 3:14</a>): "I have learned that all the works which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath made, continue for ever." But visible bodies do not continue for ever, for it is said (<a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse18">2 Corinthians 4:18</a>): "The things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> did not make visible bodies.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is said (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse31">Genesis 1:31</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> saw all things that He had made, and they were very <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." But corporeal creatures are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, since we find them harmful in many ways; as may be seen in serpents, in the sun's heat, and other things. Now a thing is called <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, in so far as it is harmful. Corporeal creatures, therefore, are not from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, what is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not withdraw us from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but leads us to Him. But corporeal creatures withdraw us from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse18">2 Corinthians 4:18</a>): "While we look not at the things which are seen." Corporeal creatures, therefore, are not from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/psa145.htm#verse6">Psalm 145:6</a>): "Who made <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth, the sea, and all things that are in them."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Certain <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> maintain that visible things are not <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but by an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> principle, and allege in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> the words of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse4">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>), "The god of this world hath blinded the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of unbelievers." But this position is altogether untenable. For, if things that differ agree in some point, there must be some <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for that agreement, since things diverse in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> cannot be united of themselves. Hence whenever in different things some one thing common to all is found, it must be that these different things receive that one thing from some one <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as different bodies that are hot receive their heat from fire. But being is found to be common to all things, however otherwise different. There must, therefore, be one principle of being from which all things in whatever way <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> have their being, whether they are invisible and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, or visible and corporeal. But the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is called the god of this world, not as having <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> it, but because worldlings serve him, of whom also the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says, speaking in the same sense, "Whose god is their belly" (<a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse19">Philippians 3:19</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> All the creatures of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in some respects continue for ever, at least as to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, since what is <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> will never be annihilated, even though it be corruptible. And the nearer a creature approaches <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is immovable, the more it also is immovable. For corruptible creatures endure for ever as regards their <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, though they change as regards their <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form. But incorruptible creatures endure with respect to their <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, though they are mutable in other respects, such as place, for instance, the heavenly bodies; or the affections, as <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> creatures. But the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle's</a> words, "The things which are seen are temporal," though <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> even as regards such things considered in themselves (in so far as every visible creature is subject to time, either as to being or as to movement), are intended to apply to visible things in so far as they are offered to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as rewards. For such rewards, as consist in these visible things, are temporal; while those that are invisible endure for ever. Hence he said before (<a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse17">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>): "It worketh for us . . . an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> weight of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Corporeal creatures according to their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, though this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is not universal, but partial and limited, the consequence of which is a certain opposition of contrary <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>, though each <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in itself. To those, however, who estimate things, not by the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> thereof, but by the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> they themselves can derive therefrom, everything which is harmful to themselves seems simply <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For they do not reflect that what is in some way injurious to one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, to another is beneficial, and that even to themselves the same thing may be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in some respects, but <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in others. And this could not be, if bodies were <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and harmful.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Creatures of themselves do not withdraw us from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but lead us to Him; for "the invisible things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made" (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse20">Romans 1:20</a>). If, then, they withdraw men from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is the fault of those who use them foolishly. Thus it is said (<a href="../bible/wis014.htm#verse11">Wisdom 14:11</a>): "Creatures are turned into a snare to the feet of the unwise." And the very fact that they can thus withdraw us from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> proves that they came from Him, for they cannot lead the foolish away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> except by the allurements of some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that they have from Him.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether corporeal things were made on account of God's goodness?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that corporeal creatures were not made on account of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. For it is said (<a href="../bible/wis001.htm#verse14">Wisdom 1:14</a>) that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "<a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> all things that they might be." Therefore all things were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> for their own being's sake, and not on account of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an end; therefore the greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in things is the end of the lesser <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> creatures are related to corporeal creatures, as the greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the lesser. Corporeal creatures, therefore, are <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> for the sake of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> creatures, and not on account of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> does not give unequal things except to the unequal. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is just: therefore inequality not <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> must precede all inequality <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by Him. But an inequality not <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can only arise from <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, and consequently all inequality results from the different movements of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. Now, corporeal creatures are unequal to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> creatures. Therefore the former were made on account of movements of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, and not on account of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/pro016.htm#verse4">Proverbs 16:4</a>): "The Lord hath made all things for Himself."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> laid down [Peri Archon ii.] that corporeal creatures were not made according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> original purpose, but in punishment of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> creatures. For he maintained that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the beginning made <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> creatures only, and all of equal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; but that of these by the use of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> some turned to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and, according to the measure of their conversion, were given an higher or a lower rank, retaining their simplicity; while others turned from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and became bound to different kinds of bodies according to the degree of their turning away. But this position is <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>. In the first place, because it is contrary to <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>, which, after narrating the production of each kind of corporeal creatures, subjoins, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> saw that it was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm">Genesis 1</a>), as if to say that everything was brought into being for the reason that it was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for it to be. But according to <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> opinion, the corporeal creature was made, not because it was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that it should be, but that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in another might be punished.

<p>Secondly, because it would follow that the arrangement, which now <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>, of the corporeal world would arise from mere chance. For it the sun's body was made what it is, that it might serve for a punishment suitable to some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> creature, it would follow, if other <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> creatures had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in the same way as the one to punish whom the sun had been <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>, that many suns would <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the world; and so of other things. But such a consequence is altogether inadmissible. Hence we must set aside this theory as <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, and consider that the entire <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is constituted by all creatures, as a whole consists of its parts.

<p>Now if we wish to assign an end to any whole, and to the parts of that whole, we shall find, first, that each and every part <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> for the sake of its proper act, as the eye for the act of seeing; secondly, that less honorable parts <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> for the more honorable, as the senses for the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, the lungs for the heart; and, thirdly, that all parts are for the perfection of the whole, as the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> for the form, since the parts are, as it were, the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the whole. Furthermore, the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is on account of an extrinsic end, that end being the fruition of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. So, therefore, in the parts of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> also every creature <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> for its own proper act and perfection, and the less noble for the nobler, as those creatures that are less noble than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> for the sake of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, whilst each and every creature <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> for the perfection of the entire <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. Furthermore, the entire <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, with all its parts, is ordained towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as its end, inasmuch as it imitates, as it were, and shows forth the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Reasonable creatures, however, have in some special and higher manner <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as their end, since they can attain to Him by their own operations, by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> Him. Thus it is plain that the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is the end of all corporeal things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In the very fact of any creature possessing being, it represents the Divine being and Its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. And, therefore, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> all things, that they might have being, does not exclude that He <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> them for His own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The proximate end does not exclude the ultimate end. Therefore that corporeal creatures were, in a manner, made for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, does not prevent their being made on account of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Equality of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> has its place in retribution, since equal rewards or punishments are due to equal <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> or demerit. But this does not apply to things as at first instituted. For just as an architect, without <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, places stones of the same kind in different parts of a building, not on account of any antecedent difference in the stones, but with a view to securing that perfection of the entire building, which could not be obtained except by the different positions of the stones; even so, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from the beginning, to secure perfection in the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, has set therein creatures of various and unequal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, according to His wisdom, and without <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, since no diversity of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> is presupposed.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether corporeal creatures were produced by God through the medium of the angels?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that corporeal creatures were produced by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through the medium of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For, as all things are governed by the Divine wisdom, so by it were all things made, according to <a href="../bible/psa103.htm#verse24">Psalm 103:24</a> "Thou hast made all things in wisdom." But "it belongs to wisdom to ordain," as stated in the beginning of the Metaphysics (i, 2). Hence in the government of things the lower is ruled by the higher in a certain fitting order, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iii, 4). Therefore in the production of things it was ordained that the corporeal should be produced by the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, as the lower by the higher.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, diversity of effects shows diversity of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, since like always produces like. It then all creatures, both <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and corporeal, were produced immediately by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, there would be no diversity in creatures, for one would not be further removed from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than another. But this is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>; for the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says that some things are corruptible because they are far removed from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (De Gen. et Corrup. ii, text. 59).

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power is not required to produce a finite effect. But every corporeal thing is finite. Therefore, it could be, and was, produced by the finite power of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> creatures: for in suchlike beings there is no distinction between what is and what is possible: especially as no dignity befitting a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is denied to that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, unless it be in punishment of a fault.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse1">Genesis 1:1</a>): "In the beginning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth"; by which are understood corporeal creatures. These, therefore, were produced immediately by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some have maintained that creatures proceeded from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by degrees, in such a way that the first creature proceeded from Him immediately, and in its turn produced another, and so on until the production of corporeal creatures. But this position is untenable, since the first production of corporeal creatures is by creation, by which <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> itself is produced: for in the act of coming into being the imperfect must be made before the perfect: and it is impossible that anything should be <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>, save by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> whereof it must be borne in mind that the higher the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, the more numerous the objects to which its causation extends. Now the underlying principle in things is always more universal than that which informs and restricts it; thus, being is more universal than living, living than understanding, <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> than form. The more widely, then, one thing underlies others, the more directly does that thing proceed from a higher <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Thus the thing that underlies primarily all things, belongs properly to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> of the supreme <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Therefore no secondary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> can produce anything, unless there is presupposed in the thing produced something that is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by a higher <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But creation is the production of a thing in its entire <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, nothing being presupposed either uncreated or <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>. Hence it remains that nothing can create except <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, Who is the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Therefore, in order to show that all bodies were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> immediately by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said: "In the beginning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In the production of things an order <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>, but not such that one creature is <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by another, for that is impossible; but rather such that by the Divine wisdom diverse grades are constituted in creatures.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, though one, has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of many and different things without detriment to the simplicity of His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as has been shown above (Question 15, Article 2); so that by His wisdom He is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of diverse things as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by Him, even as an artificer, by apprehending diverse forms, produces diverse works of art.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The amount of the power of an agent is measured not only by the thing made, but also by the manner of making it; for one and the same thing is made in one way by a higher power, in another by a lower. But the production of finite things, where nothing is presupposed as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a>, is the work of <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power, and, as such, can belong to no creature.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the forms of bodies are from the angels?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the forms of bodies come from the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Trin. i): "From forms that are without <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> come the forms that are in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>." But forms that are without <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> are <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, and forms that are in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> are the forms of bodies. Therefore, the forms of bodies are from <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, all that is such by participation is reduced to that which is such by its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. But <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> are forms <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, whereas corporeal creatures have forms by participation. Therefore the forms of corporeal things are derived from <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> have more power of causation than the heavenly bodies. But the heavenly bodies give form to things here below, for which reason they are said to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> generation and corruption. Much more, therefore, are material forms derived from <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iii, 8): "We must not suppose that this corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> serves the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> at their nod, but rather that it obeys <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> thus." But corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> may be said thus to serve that from which it receives its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Corporeal forms, then, are not from the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It was the opinion of some that all corporeal forms are derived from <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, which we call the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. And there are two ways in which this has been stated. For <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> held that the forms of corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> are derived from, and formed by, forms immaterially subsisting, by a kind of participation. Thus he held that there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> an immaterial <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and an immaterial horse, and so forth, and that from such the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> sensible things that we see are constituted, in so far as in corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> there abides the impression received from these separate forms, by a kind of assimilation, or as he calls it, "participation" (Phaedo xlix). And, according to the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a>, the order of forms corresponds to the order of those separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>; for example, that there is a single separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, which is horse and the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all horses, whilst above this is separate life, or "per se" life, as they term it, which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all life, and that above this again is that which they call being itself, which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all being. <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a>, however, and certain others, have maintained that the forms of corporeal things do not subsist "per se" in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> only. Thus they say that from forms <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> creatures (called "intelligences" by them, but "<a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>" by us) proceed all the forms of corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as the form of his handiwork proceeds from the forms in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the craftsman. This theory seems to be the same as that of certain <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> of modern times, who say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> indeed <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> all things, but that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> formed corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and differentiated it into <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p>But all these opinions seem to have a common origin; they all, in fact, sought for a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of forms as though the form were of itself brought into being. Whereas, as <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> (Metaph. vii, text. 26,27,28), proves, what is, properly speaking, made, is the "composite." Now, such are the forms of corruptible things that at one time they <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> and at another <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> not, without being themselves generated or corrupted, but by reason of the generation or corruption of the "composite"; since even forms have not being, but composites have being through forms: for, according to a thing's mode of being, is the mode in which it is brought into being. Since, then, like is produced from like, we must not look for the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of corporeal forms in any immaterial form, but in something that is composite, as this fire is generated by that fire. Corporeal forms, therefore, are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a>, not as emanations from some immaterial form, but by <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> being brought from <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> into act by some composite agent. But since the composite agent, which is a body, is moved by a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iii, 4,5), it follows further that even corporeal forms are derived from <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, not emanating from them, but as the term of their movement. And, further still, the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which are, as it were, the seminal types of corporeal forms, must be referred to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But in the first production of corporeal creatures no transmutation from <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to act can have taken place, and accordingly, the corporeal forms that bodies had when first produced came immediately form <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose bidding alone <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> obeys, as its own proper <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. To signify this, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> prefaces each work with the words, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> said, Let this thing be," or "that," to denote the formation of all things by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, from Whom, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [Tract. i. in Joan. and Gen. ad lit. i. 4, is "all form and fitness and concord of parts."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> By immaterial forms <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> understands the types of things in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Thus the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse3">Hebrews 11:3</a>): "By <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> we understand that the world was framed by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>; that from invisible things visible things might be made." But if by immaterial forms he understands the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, we say that from them come material forms, not by emanation, but by motion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Forms received into <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> are to be referred, not to self-subsisting forms of the same type, as the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a> held, but either to intelligible forms of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, from which they proceed by movement, or, still higher, to the types in the Divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, by which the seeds of forms are implanted in <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things, that they may be able to be brought by movement into act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The heavenly bodies inform earthly ones by movement, not by emanation.
