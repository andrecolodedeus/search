<h1>Question 66. Bigamy and of the irregularity contracted thereby</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5066.htm#article1"> Does irregularity attach to the bigamy that consists in having two successive wives?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5066.htm#article2"> Is irregularity contracted by one who has two wives at once?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5066.htm#article3"> Is irregularity contracted by marrying one who is not a virgin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5066.htm#article4"> Is bigamy removed by Baptism?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5066.htm#article5"> Can a dispensation be granted to a bigamous person?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether irregularity attaches to bigamy?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a> is not attached to the <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">bigamy</a> that consists in having two wives successively. For multitude and unity are consequent upon being. Since then non-being does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> plurality, a man who has two wives successively, the one in being, the other in non-being, does not thereby become the husband of more than one wife, so as to be debarred, according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse2">1 Timothy 3:2</a>; <a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse6">Titus 1:6</a>), from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopate</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a man who commits fornication with several <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> gives more evidence of incontinence than one who has several wives successively. Yet in the first case a man does not become <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregular</a>. Therefore neither in the second should he become <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregular</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">bigamy</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a>, this is either because of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, or because of the carnal intercourse. Now it is not on account of the former, for if a man had contracted marriage by words of the present and, his wife dying before the consummation of the marriage, he were to marry another, he would become <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregular</a>, which is against the decree of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> (cap. Dubium, De bigamia). Nor again is it on account of the second, for then a man who had committed fornication with several <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> would become <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregular</a>: which is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">bigamy</a> nowise <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> By the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacrament of order</a> a man is appointed to the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>; and he who has to administer the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> to others must suffer from no defect in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Now there is a defect in a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> when the entire signification of the sacrament is not found therein. And the sacrament of marriage signifies the union of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which is the union of one with one. Therefore the perfect signification of the sacrament requires the husband to have only one wife, and the wife to have but one husband; and consequently <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">bigamy</a>, which does away with this, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a>. And there are four kinds of <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">bigamy</a>: the first is when a man has several lawful wives successively; the second is when a man has several wives at once, one in <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, the other in fact; the third, when he has several successively, one in <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, the other in fact; the fourth, when a man marries a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>. Accordingly <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a> attaches to all of these.

<p>There is another consequent reason assigned, since those who receive the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacrament of order</a> should be signalized by the greatest spirituality, both because they administer <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, namely the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and because they teach <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, and should be occupied in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> matters. Wherefore since <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is most incompatible with spirituality, inasmuch as it makes a man to be wholly carnal, they should give no sign of persistent <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, which does indeed show itself in <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">bigamous</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, seeing that they were unwilling to be content with one wife. The first reason however is the better.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The multitude of several wives at the same time is a multitude simply, wherefore a multitude of this kind is wholly inconsistent with the signification of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, so that the sacrament is voided on that account. But the multitude of several successive wives is a multitude relatively, wherefore it does not entirely destroy the signification of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, nor does it void the sacrament in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> but in its perfection, which is required of those who are the dispensers of <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although those who are guilty of fornication give <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of greater <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, theirs is not a so persistent <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, since by fornication one party is not bound to the other for ever; and consequently no defect attaches to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above, <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">bigamy</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a>, because it destroys the perfect signification of the sacrament: which signification is seated both in the union of minds, as expressed by the consent, and in the union of bodies. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">bigamy</a> must affect both of these at the same time in order to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a>. Hence the decree of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> disposes of the statement of the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> (Sent. iv, D, 27), namely that consent alone by words of the present is sufficient to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether irregularity results from bigamy, when one husband has two wives, one in law, the other in fact?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a> does not result from <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">bigamy</a> when one husband has two wives at the same time, one in <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and one in fact. For when the sacrament is void there can be no defect in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Now when a man marries a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in fact but not in <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> there is no sacrament, since such a union does not signify the union of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Therefore since <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a> does not result from <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">bigamy</a> except on account of a defect in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, it would seem that no <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a> attaches to <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">bigamy</a> of this kind.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if a man has intercourse with a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> whom he has <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> in fact and not in <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, he commits fornication if he has not a lawful wife, or <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> if he has. But a man does not become <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregular</a> by dividing his flesh among several <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> by fornication or <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. Therefore neither does he by the aforesaid kind of <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">bigamy</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it may happen that a man, before <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> carnally the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> he has <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> in <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, marries another in fact and not in <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> her carnally, whether the former <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> be living or dead. Now this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has contracted marriage with several <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> either in <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> or in fact, and yet he is not <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregular</a>, since he has not divided his flesh among several <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a> is not contracted by reason of the aforesaid kind of <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">bigamy</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">Irregularity</a> is contracted in the two second kinds of <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">bigamy</a>, for although in the one there is no sacrament, there is a certain likeness to a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Wherefore these two kinds are secondary, and the first is the principal kind in <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although there is no sacrament in this case there is a certain likeness to a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, whereas there is no such likeness in fornication or <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. Hence the comparison fails.

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the Second Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In this case the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not reckoned a <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">bigamist</a>, because the first marriage lacked its perfect signification. Nevertheless if, by the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he be compelled to return to his first wife and carnally to know her, he becomes <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregular</a> forthwith, because the <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a> is the result not of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> but of imperfect signification.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether irregularity is contracted by marrying one who is not a virgin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a> is not contracted by marrying one who is not a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. For a man's own defect is a greater impediment to him than the defect of another. But if the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> himself who marries is not a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> he does not become <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregular</a>. Therefore much less does he if his wife is not a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it may happen that a man marries a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> after corrupting her. Now, seemingly, such a man does not become <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregular</a>, since he has not divided his flesh among several, nor has his wife done so, and yet he marries a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who is not a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. Therefore this kind of <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">bigamy</a> does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can become <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregular</a> except <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>. But sometimes a man marries involuntarily one who is not a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, for instance when he thinks her a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> and afterwards, by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> her carnally, finds that she is not. Therefore this kind does not always <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, unlawful intercourse after marriage is more guilty than before marriage. Now if a wife, after the marriage has been consummated, has intercourse with another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, her husband does not become <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregular</a>, otherwise he would be punished for his wife's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Moreover, it might happen that, after <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> of this, he pays her the debt at her asking, before she is accused and convicted of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. Therefore it would seem that this kind of <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">bigamy</a> does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Regist. ii, ep. 37): "We command thee never to make unlawful ordinations, nor to admit to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> orders a <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">bigamist</a>, or one who has <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that is not a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, or one who is unlettered, or one who is deformed in his limbs, or bound to do penance or to perform some civil <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, or who is in any state of subjection."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In the union of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> unity is found on either side. Consequently whether we find division of the flesh on the part of the husband, or on the part of the wife, there is a defect of sacrament. There is, however, a difference, because on the part of the husband it is required that he should not have <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> another wife, but not that he should be a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, whereas on the part of the wife it is also required that she be a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. The reason assigned by those versed in the Decretals is because the bridegroom signifies the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> militant which is entrusted to the care of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and in which there are many corruptions, while the spouse signifies <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Who was a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>: wherefore <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> on the part of the spouse, but not on the part of the bridegroom, is required in order that a man be made a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. This reason, however, is expressly contrary to the words of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse25">Ephesians 5:25</a>): "Husbands, love your wives, as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> also loved the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>," which show that the bride signifies the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the bridegroom <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; and again he says (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse23">Ephesians 5:23</a>): "Because the husband is the head of the wife, as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>." Wherefore others say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is signified by the bridegroom, and that the bride signifies the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> triumphant in which there is no stain. Also that the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> was first united to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as a <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubine</a>; so that the sacrament loses nothing of its signification if the bridegroom previously had a <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubine</a>. But this is most absurd, since just as the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of ancients and of moderns is one, so is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> one. Wherefore those who served <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> at the time of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> belonged to the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in which we serve <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Moreover this is expressly contrary to <a href="../bible/jer003.htm#verse14">Jeremiah 3:14</a>, <a href="../bible/eze016.htm#verse8">Ezekiel 16:8</a>, <a href="../bible/hos002.htm#verse16">Hosea 2:16</a>, where the espousals of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> are mentioned explicitly: so that she was not as a <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubine</a> but as a wife. Again, according to this, fornication would be the sacred sign [sacramentum] of that union, which is absurd. Wherefore heathendom, before being espoused to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, was corrupted by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> through <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. Hence we must say otherwise that <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by a defect in the sacrament itself. Now when corruption of the flesh occurs outside wedlock on account of a preceding marriage, it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> no defect in the sacrament on the part of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> corrupted, but it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a defect in the other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, because the act of one who contracts marriage terminates not in himself, but in the other party, wherefore it takes its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from its term, which, moreover, in regard to that act, is the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> as it were of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Consequently if a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> were able to receive orders, just as her husband becomes <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregular</a> through marrying one who is not a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, but not through his not being a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> when he marries, so also would a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> become <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregular</a> if she were to marry a man who is not a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, but not if she were no longer a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> when she <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> --unless she had been corrupted by reason of a previous marriage.

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In this case opinions differ. It is, however, more probable that he is not <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregular</a>, because he has not divided his flesh among several <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">Irregularity</a> is not the infliction of a punishment, but the defect of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Consequently it is not always <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">bigamy</a> to be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> in order to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a>. Hence a man who marries a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, thinking her to be a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, whereas she is not, becomes <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregular</a> by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> her carnally.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> If a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> commits fornication after being <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a>, her husband does not become <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregular</a> on that account, unless he again <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> her carnally after she has been corrupted by <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, since otherwise the corruption of the wife nowise affects the marriage act of the husband. But though he be compelled by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to pay her the debt, or if he do so at her request, being compelled by his own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, even before she is convicted of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, he becomes <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregular</a>, albeit opinions differ on this point. However, what we have said is more probable, since here it is not a question of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but of signification only.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether bigamy is removed by Baptism?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">bigamy</a> is removed by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says in his commentary on the <a href="../cathen/14727b.htm">Epistle to Titus</a> (<a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse6">1:6</a>, "the husband of one wife") that if a man has had several wives before receiving <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, or one before and another after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, he is not a <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">bigamist</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">bigamy</a> is removed by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, he who does what is more, does what is less. Now <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> removes all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a greater thing than <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a>. Therefore it removes <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> takes away all punishment resulting from an act. Now such is the <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a> of <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">bigamy</a>. Therefore, etc.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">bigamist</a> is <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregular</a> because he is deficient in the representation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Now by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> we are fully conformed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore this <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a> is removed.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> are more efficacious than the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> removed irregularities according to the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master's</a> statement (Sent. iv,). Therefore <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> also, being the most efficacious of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, removes the <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a> consequent upon <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">bigamy</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Bono Conjug. xviii): "Those understand the question more correctly who maintain that a man who has <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> a second wife, though he was a <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumen</a> or even a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> at the time, cannot be ordained, because it is a question of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, not of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>."

<p>Further, according to the same authority (De Bono Conjug. xviii) "a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who has been corrupted while a <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumen</a> or a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> cannot after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> among <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>." Therefore in like manner one who was a <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">bigamist</a> before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> cannot be ordained.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> removes <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but does not dissolve marriage. Wherefore since <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a> results from marriage, it cannot be removed by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Bono Conjug. xviii).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In this case <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome's</a> opinion is not followed: unless perhaps he wished to explain that he means that a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> should be more easily granted.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It does not follow that what does a greater thing, does a lesser, unless it be directed to the latter. This is not so in the case in point, because <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is not directed to the removal of an <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This must be understood of punishments consequent upon actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which are, or have yet to be, inflicted: for one does not recover <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, nor again undivision of the flesh.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> conforms a man to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as regards the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, but not as to the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the body, which is effected by <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> or division of the flesh.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Those irregularities were contracted through slight and temporary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, and consequently they could be removed by those <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Moreover the latter were ordained for that purpose, whereas <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is not.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether it is lawful for a bigamist to receive a dispensation?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem unlawful for a <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">bigamist</a> to be granted a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>. For it is said (Extra, De bigamis, cap. Nuper): "It is not lawful to grant a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> to <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> who, as far as they could do so, have taken to themselves a second wife."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is not lawful to grant a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>. Now whatever is in the canonical writings belongs to the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>. Since then in canonical <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse2">1 Timothy 3:2</a>): "It behooveth . . . a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to be . . . the husband of one wife," it would seem that a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> cannot be granted in this matter.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no one can receive a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> in what is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. But it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacrament of order</a> that the recipient be not <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregular</a>, since the signification which is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is lacking in one who is <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregular</a>. Therefore he cannot be granted a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> in this.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, what is reasonably done cannot be reasonably undone. If, therefore, a <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">bigamist</a> can lawfully receive a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>, it was unreasonable that he should be <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregular</a>: which is inadmissible.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/09412b.htm">Pope Lucius</a> granted a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Palermo who was a <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">bigamist</a>, as stated in the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on can. Lector, dist. 34.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/09723c.htm">Pope Martin</a> [<a href="../cathen/09731b.htm">Martinus Bracarensis</a>: cap. xliii] says: "If a Reader marry a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, let him remain a Reader, or if there be need for it, he may receive the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">Subdiaconate</a>, but no higher order: and the same applies if he should be a <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">bigamist</a>." Therefore he may at least receive a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> as far as the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">Subdiaconate</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">Irregularity</a> attaches to <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">bigamy</a> not by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, but by positive <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; nor again is it one of the essentials of order that a man be not a <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">bigamist</a>, which is evident from the fact that if a <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">bigamist</a> present himself for orders, he receives the character. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a> can dispense altogether from such an <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a>; but a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, only as regards the <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>, though some say that in order to prevent religious wandering abroad he can dispense therefrom as regards the major orders in those who wish to serve <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in religion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a> shows that there is the same difficulty against granting a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> in those who have <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> several wives in fact, as if they had <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> them in <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; but it does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a> has no power to grant a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> in such cases.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> as regards things belonging to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, and those which are <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But in those which owe their institution to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has the same power now as then of setting up and of putting down, she can grant a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> through him who holds the <a href="../cathen/12423a.htm">primacy</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Not every signification is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but that alone which belongs to the sacramental effect,* and this is not removed by <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a>. [Leonine edition reads "officium," some read "effectum"; the meaning is the same, and is best rendered as above.]

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> In particular cases there is no ratio that applies to all equally, on account of their variety. Hence what is reasonably established for all, in consideration of what happens in the majority of cases, can be with equal reason done away in a certain definite case.
