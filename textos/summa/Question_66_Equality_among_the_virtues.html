<h1>Question 66. Equality among the virtues</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2066.htm#article1"> Can one virtue be greater or less than another?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2066.htm#article2"> Are all the virtues existing together in one subject equal?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2066.htm#article3"> Moral virtue in comparison with intellectual virtue</a> <li><a href="../summa/2066.htm#article4"> The moral virtues as compared with one another</a> <li><a href="../summa/2066.htm#article5"> The intellectual virtues in comparison with one another</a> <li><a href="../summa/2066.htm#article6"> The theological virtues in comparison with one another</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether one virtue can be greater or less than another?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> cannot be greater or less than another. For it is written (<a href="../bible/rev021.htm#verse16">Apocalypse 21:16</a>) that the sides of the city of Jerusalem are equal; and a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says that the sides denote the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Therefore all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are equal; and consequently one cannot be greater than another.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a thing that, by its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, consists in a maximum, cannot be more or less. Now the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> consists in a maximum, for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is "the limit of power," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (De Coelo i, text. 116); and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Lib. Arb. ii, 19) that "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are very great boons, and no one can use them to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> purpose." Therefore it seems that one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> cannot be greater or less than another.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of an effect is measured by the power of the agent. But perfect, viz. infused <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, are from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Whose power is uniform and <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. Therefore it seems that one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> cannot be greater than another.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Wherever there can be increase and greater abundance, there can be inequality. Now <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> admit of greater abundance and increase: for it is written (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse20">Matthew 5:20</a>): "Unless your <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> abound more than that of the Scribes and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, you shall not enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>": and (<a href="../bible/pro015.htm#verse5">Proverbs 15:5</a>): "In abundant <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> there is the greatest strength [virtus]." Therefore it seems that a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> can be greater or less than another.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> When it is asked whether one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> can be greater than another, the question can be taken in two senses. First, as applying to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. In this sense it is clear that one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is greater than another; since a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is always more excellent than its effect; and among effects, those nearest to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> are the most excellent. Now it is clear from what has been said (18, 5; 61, 2) that the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and root of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is the reason. Hence <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> which perfects the reason, surpasses in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> the other moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which perfect the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, in so far as it partakes of reason. And among these, one is better than another, according as it approaches nearer to the reason. Consequently <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which is in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, excels the remaining moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, which is in the irascible part, stands before <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, which is in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>, which has a smaller share of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, as stated in Ethic. vii, 6.

<p>The question can be taken in another way, as referring to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. In this way, according to what was said above (Question 52, Article 1), when we were treating of the intensity of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> may be said to be greater or less in two ways: first, in itself; secondly with regard to the subject that partakes of it. If we consider it in itself, we shall call it greater or little, according to the things to which it extends. Now whosoever has a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, e.g. <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, has it in respect of whatever <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> extends to. But this does not apply to science and art: for every grammarian does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> everything relating to grammar. And in this sense the Stoics said rightly, as Simplicius states in his Commentary on the Predicaments, that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> cannot be more or less, as science and art can; because the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> consists in a maximum.

<p>If, however, we consider <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> on the part of the subject, it may then be greater or less, either in relation to different times, or in different men. Because one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is better disposed than another to attain to the mean of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which is defined by right reason; and this, on account of either greater habituation, or a better <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> disposition, or a more discerning judgment of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, or again a greater <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which is given to each one "according to the measure of the giving of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>," as stated in <a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse9">Ephesians 4:9</a>. And here the Stoics <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erred</a>, for they held that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be deemed <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, unless he were, in the highest degree, disposed to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Because the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> does not require that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should reach the mean of right reason as though it were an indivisible point, as the Stoics thought; but it is enough that he should approach the mean, as stated in Ethic. ii, 6. Moreover, one same indivisible mark is reached more nearly and more readily by one than by another: as may be seen when several arches aim at a fixed target.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This equality is not one of absolute <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, but of proportion: because all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> grow in a man proportionately, as we shall see further on (2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This "limit" which belongs to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, can have the character of something "more" or "less" <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, in the ways explained above: since, as stated, it is not an indivisible limit.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not work by <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but according to the order of His wisdom, whereby He bestows on men various measures of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, according to <a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse7">Ephesians 4:7</a>: "To every one of you [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'us'] is given <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> according to the measure of the giving of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether all the virtues that are together in one man, are equal?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in one same <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> are not all equally intense. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse7">1 Corinthians 7:7</a>): "Everyone hath his proper <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; one after this manner, and another after that." Now one <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> would not be more proper than another to a man, if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> infused all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> equally into each <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not all equal in one and the same <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> were equally intense in one and the same <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, it would follow that whoever surpasses another in one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, would surpass him in all the others. But this is clearly not the case: since various <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are specially praised for different <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; e.g. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> for <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (<a href="../bible/rom004.htm">Romans 4</a>), <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> for his meekness (<a href="../bible/num007.htm#verse3">Numbers 7:3</a>), <a href="../cathen/08413a.htm">Job</a> for his patience (<a href="../bible/tob002.htm#verse12">Tobit 2:12</a>). This is why of each Confessor the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> sings: "There was not found his like in keeping the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">most High</a>," [See Lesson in the Mass Statuit (Dominican Missal)], since each one was remarkable for some <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> or other. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not all equal in one and the same <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the more intense a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is, the greater one's pleasure and readiness in making use of it. Now experience shows that a man is more pleased and ready to make use of one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than of another. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not all equal in one and the same <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. vi, 4) that "those who are equal in <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> are equal in <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>," and so on. Now it would not be so, unless all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> were equal. Therefore all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are equal in one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As explained above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), the comparative greatness of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> can be understood in two ways. First, as referring to their specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: and in this way there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that in a man one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is greater than another, for example, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, than <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope. Secondly, it may be taken as referring to the degree of participation by the subject, according as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> becomes intense or remiss in its subject. In this sense all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> are equal with an equality of proportion, in so far as their growth in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is equal: thus the fingers are unequal in size, but equal in proportion, since they grow in proportion to one another.

<p>Now the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of this equality is to be explained in the same way as the connection of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; for equality among <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> is their connection as to greatness. Now it has been stated above (Question 65, Article 1) that a twofold connection of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> may be assigned. The first is according to the opinion of those who understood these four <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> to be four general properties of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, each of which is found together with the other in any <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. In this way <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> cannot be said to be equal in any <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> unless they have all these properties equal. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> alludes to this kind of equality (De Trin. vi, 4) when he says: "If you say these men are equal in <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, but that one is more <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> than the other; it follows that the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> of the latter is less <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>. Consequently they are not really equal in <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, since the former's <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is more <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>. You will find that this applies to the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> if you run over them all in the same way."

<p>The other kind of connection among <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> followed the opinion of those who hold these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> to have their own proper respective matters (65, A1,2). In this way the connection among moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> results from <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and, as to the infused <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and not from the inclination, which is on the part of the subject, as stated above (Question 65, Article 1). Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the equality among <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> can also be considered on the part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, in regard to that which is formal in all the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: for in one and the same <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, so long as his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> has the same degree of perfection, the mean will be proportionately defined according to right reason in each <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p>But in regard to that which is material in the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, viz. the inclination to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> act, one may be readier to perform the act of one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, than the act of another <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and this either from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, or from habituation, or again by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This saying of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> may be taken to refer to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which are not common to all, nor are all of them equal in the one same subject. We might also say that it refers to the measure of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, by reason of which one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in greater abundance than another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, on account of his greater abundance of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, or also of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, in which all the infused <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are connected.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> One <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> is praised chiefly for one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, another <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> for another <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, on account of his more admirable readiness for the act of one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than for the act of another <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the Third Objection.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the moral virtues are better than the intellectual virtues?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are better than the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>. Because that which is more <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, and more lasting, is better. Now the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are "more lasting even than the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>" (Ethic. i) which are <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: and, moreover, they are more <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life. Therefore they are preferable to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is defined as "that which makes its possessor <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is said to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in respect of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and art in respect of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, except perhaps in respect of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> alone. Therefore moral is better than <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the end is more excellent than the means. But according to Ethic. vi, 12, "moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> gives right <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the end; whereas <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> gives right choice of the means." Therefore moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is more excellent than <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that regards moral matters.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is in that part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is rational by participation; while <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> rational part, as stated in Ethic. i, 13. Now rational by <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is more excellent than rational by participation. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is better than moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing may be said to be greater or less in two ways: first, simply; secondly, relatively. For nothing hinders something from being better simply, e.g. "learning than <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>," and yet not better relatively, i.e. "for one who is in want" [Aristotle, Topic. iii.]. Now to consider a thing simply is to consider it in its proper specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Accordingly, a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> takes its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from its object, as explained above (54, 2; 60, 1). Hence, speaking simply, that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is more excellent, which has the more excellent object. Now it is evident that the object of the reason is more excellent than the object of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>: since the reason apprehends things in the universal, while the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> tends to things themselves, whose being is restricted to the particular. Consequently, speaking simply, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, which perfect the reason, are more excellent than the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, which perfect the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p>But if we consider <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in its relation to act, then moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which perfects the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, whose function it is to move the other powers to act, as stated above (Question 9, Article 1), is more excellent. And since <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is so called from its being a principle of action, for it is the perfection of a power, it follows again that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> agrees more with moral than with <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, though the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are more excellent <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, simply speaking.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are more lasting than the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, because they are practised in matters pertaining to the life of the community. Yet it is evident that the objects of the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, which are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> and invariable, are more lasting than the objects of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which are certain particular matters of action. That the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are more <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, proves that they are more excellent, not simply, but relatively. Indeed, the speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, from the very fact that they are not referred to something else, as a useful thing is referred to an end, are more excellent. The reason for this is that in them we have a kind of beginning of that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> which consists in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as stated above (Question 3, Article 6).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The reason why <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is said to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> simply, in respect of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but not in respect of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, is because the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> moves the other powers to their acts, as stated above (Question 56, Article 3). Wherefore this argument, too, proves merely that moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is better relatively.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">Prudence</a> directs the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> not only in the choice of the means, but also in appointing the end. Now the end of each moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is to attain the mean in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> proper to that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; which mean is appointed according to the right ruling of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, as stated in Ethic. ii, 6; vi, 13.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether justice is the chief of the moral virtues?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is not the chief of the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For it is better to give of one's own than to pay what is due. Now the former belongs to liberality, the latter to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Therefore liberality is apparently a greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the chief <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of a thing is, seemingly, that in which it is most perfect. Now, according to <a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse4">James 1:4</a>, "Patience hath a perfect work." Therefore it would seem that patience is greater than <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "Magnanimity has a great influence on every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>," as stated in Ethic. iv, 3. Therefore it magnifies even <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Therefore it is greater than <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. v, 1) that "<a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is the most excellent of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> considered in its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> may be greater or less, either simply or relatively. A <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is said to be greater simply, whereby a greater rational <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> shines forth, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). In this way <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is the most excellent of all the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as being most akin to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. This is made evident by considering its subject and its object: its subject, because this is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the rational <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, as stated above (8, 1; 26, 1): its object or <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, because it is about operations, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is set in order not only in himself, but also in regard to another. Hence "<a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is the most excellent of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>" (Ethic. v, 1). Among the other moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, which are about the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, the more excellent the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in which the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> movement is subjected to reason, so much the more does the rational <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> shine forth in each. Now in things touching <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the chief of all is life, on which all other things depend. Consequently <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> which subjects the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> movement to reason in matters of life and death, holds the first place among those moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> that are about the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, but is subordinate to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. 1) that "those <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> must needs be greatest which receive the most praise: since <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a power of doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Hence the brave <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and the just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> more than others; because the former," i.e. <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, "is useful in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and the latter," i.e. <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, "both in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and in peace." After <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> comes <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, which subjects the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> to reason in matters directly relating to life, in the one <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, or in the one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, viz. in matters of food and of sex. And so these three <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, together with <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, are called principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, in excellence also.

<p>A <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is said to be greater relatively, by reason of its helping or adorning a principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: even as <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is more excellent simply than <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>: and yet relatively some particular <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> is more excellent than <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> in so far as it perfects <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> in some <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> mode of being.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The act of liberality needs to be founded on an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, for "a man is not liberal in giving, unless he gives of his own" (Polit. ii, 3). Hence there could be no liberality apart from <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which discerns between "meum" and "tuum": whereas <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> can be without liberality. Hence <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is simply greater than liberality, as being more universal, and as being its foundation: while liberality is greater relatively since it is an ornament and an addition to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Patience is said to have "a perfect work," by enduring <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, wherein it excludes not only <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> revenge, which is also excluded by <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; not only <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, which is also suppressed by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; nor only <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, which is calmed by gentleness; but also inordinate sorrow, which is the root of all the above. Wherefore it is more perfect and excellent through plucking up the root in this matter. It is not, however, more perfect than all the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> simply. Because <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> not only endures trouble without being disturbed, but also fights against it if <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Hence whoever is brave is patient; but the converse does not hold, for patience is a part of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There can be no magnanimity without the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as stated in Ethic. iv, 3. Hence it is compared to them as their ornament, so that relatively it is greater than all the others, but not simply.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether wisdom is the greatest of the intellectual virtues?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that wisdom is not the greatest of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Because the commander is greater than the one commanded. Now <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> seems to command wisdom, for it is stated in Ethic. i, 2 that political science, which belongs to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> (Ethic. vi, 8), "orders that <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> should be cultivated in states, and to which of these each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> should devote himself, and to what extent." Since, then, wisdom is one of the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, it seems that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is greater than wisdom.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to direct <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>: because <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is "the disposition of a perfect thing to that which is best," as stated in Phys. vii, text. 17. Now <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is "right reason about things to be done," whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is brought to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>: whereas wisdom takes no notice of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> attains <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is a greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than wisdom.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the more perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is, the greater it seems to be. Now we can have more perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, which are the subject of science, than of Divine things, which are the object of wisdom, which is the distinction given by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. xii, 14): because Divine things are incomprehensible, according to <a href="../bible/job026.htm#verse26">Job 26:26</a>: "Behold <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is great, exceeding our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>." Therefore science is a greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than wisdom.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of principles is more excellent than <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of conclusions. But wisdom draws conclusions from indemonstrable principles which are the object of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of understanding, even as other <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> do. Therefore understanding is a greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than wisdom.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vi, 7) that wisdom is "the head" among "the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), the greatness of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as to its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, is taken from its object. Now the object of wisdom surpasses the objects of all the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: because wisdom considers the Supreme Cause, which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated at the beginning of the Metaphysics. And since it is by the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that we judge of an effect, and by the higher <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that we judge of the lower effects; hence it is that wisdom exercises judgment over all the other <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, directs them all, and is the architect of them all.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is about <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, and wisdom about the Supreme Cause, it is impossible for <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> to be a greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than wisdom, "unless," as stated in Ethic. vi, 7, "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> were the greatest thing in the world." Wherefore we must say, as stated in the same book (Ethic. vi), that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> does not command wisdom, but vice versa: because "the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> judgeth all things; and he himself is judged by no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" (<a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse15">1 Corinthians 2:15</a>). For <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> has no business with supreme matters which are the object of wisdom: but its command covers things directed to wisdom, viz. how men are to obtain wisdom. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, or political science, is, in this way, the servant of wisdom; for it leads to wisdom, preparing the way for her, as the doorkeeper for the king.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">Prudence</a> considers the means of acquiring <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, but wisdom considers the very object of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, viz. the Supreme Intelligible. And if indeed the consideration of wisdom were perfect in respect of its object, there would be perfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> in the act of wisdom: but as, in this life, the act of wisdom is imperfect in respect of its principal object, which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it follows that the act of wisdom is a beginning or participation of future <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, so that wisdom is nearer than <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima i, text. 1), "one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is preferable to another, either because it is about a higher object, or because it is more <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>." Hence if the objects be equally <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and sublime, that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> will be greater which possesses more <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. But a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which is less certain about a higher and better object, is preferable to that which is more <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> about an object of inferior degree. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Coelo ii, text. 60) that "it is a great thing to be able to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> something about celestial beings, though it be based on weak and probable reasoning"; and again (De Part. Animal. i, 5) that "it is better to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> a little about sublime things, than much about mean things." Accordingly wisdom, to which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> pertains, is beyond the reach of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, especially in this life, so as to be his possession: for this "belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone" (Metaph. i, 2): and yet this little <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> which we can have through wisdom is preferable to all other <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of indemonstrable principles depends on the meaning of the terms: for as soon as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is a whole, and what is a part, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> at once that every whole is greater than its part. Now to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the meaning of being and non-being, of whole and part, and of other things consequent to being, which are the terms whereof indemonstrable principles are constituted, is the function of wisdom: since universal being is the proper effect of the Supreme Cause, which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And so wisdom makes use of indemonstrable principles which are the object of understanding, not only by drawing conclusions from them, as other <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> do, but also by passing its judgment on them, and by vindicating them against those who deny them. Hence it follows that wisdom is a greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than understanding.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether charity is the greatest of the theological virtues?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not the greatest of the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Because, since <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, while hope and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> are in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, it seems that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is compared to hope and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> to moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is greater than moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as was made evident above (Question 62, Article 3). Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is greater than hope and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, when two things are added together, the result is greater than either one. Now hope results from something added to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; for it presupposes love, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion viii), and it adds a certain movement of stretching forward to the beloved. Therefore hope is greater than <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is more noble than its effect. Now <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: for a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse3">Matthew 1:3</a> says that "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> begets hope, and hope <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope are greater than <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse13">1 Corinthians 13:13</a>): "Now there remain <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, these three; but the greatest of these is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), the greatness of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as to its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, is taken from its object. Now, since the three theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> look at <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as their proper object, it cannot be said that any one of them is greater than another by reason of its having a greater object, but only from the fact that it approaches nearer than another to that object; and in this way <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is greater than the others. Because the others, in their very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, imply a certain distance from the object: since <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is of what is not seen, and hope is of what is not possessed. But the love of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is of that which is already possessed: since the beloved is, in a manner, in the lover, and, again, the lover is drawn by desire to union with the beloved; hence it is written (<a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse16">1 John 4:16</a>): "He that abideth in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, abideth in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in him."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> and hope are not related to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> in the same way as <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> to moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and for two reasons. First, because the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> have an object surpassing the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: whereas <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are about things beneath <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Now in things that are above <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, to love them is more excellent than to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them. Because <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is perfected by the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> being in the knower: whereas love is perfected by the lover being drawn to the beloved. Now that which is above <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is more excellent in itself than in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: since a thing is contained according to the mode of the container. But it is the other way about in things beneath <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Secondly, because <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> moderates the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> movements pertaining to the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, whereas <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> does not moderate the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> movement tending to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which movement belongs to the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: it only shows the object. And this <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> movement towards its object surpasses <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, according to <a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse19">Ephesians 3:19</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> which surpasseth all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Hope presupposes love of that which a man hopes to obtain; and such love is love of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, whereby he who desires <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, loves himself rather than something else. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> implies love of friendship, to which we are led by hope, as stated above (Question 62, Article 4).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> An efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is more noble than its effect: but not a disposing <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. For otherwise the heat of fire would be more noble than the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, to which the heat disposes the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. It is in this way that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> begets hope, and hope <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: in the sense, to wit, that one is a disposition to the other.
