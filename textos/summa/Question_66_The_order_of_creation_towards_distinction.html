<h1>Question 66. The order of creation towards distinction</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1066.htm#article1"> Did formlessness of created matter precede in time its formation?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1066.htm#article2"> Is the matter of all corporeal things the same?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1066.htm#article3"> Was the empyrean heaven created contemporaneously with formless matter?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1066.htm#article4"> Was time created simultaneously with it?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether formlessness of created matter preceded in time its formation?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that formlessness of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> preceded in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> its formation. For it is said (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse2">Genesis 1:2</a>): "The earth was void and empty," or "invisible and shapeless," according to another version [<a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>]; by which is understood the formlessness of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. xii, 12). Therefore <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> was formless until it received its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in its working imitates the working of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as a secondary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> imitates a first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But in the working of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> formlessness precedes form in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. It does so, therefore, in the Divine working.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is higher than <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, for <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is part of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can effect that <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> without <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, as in the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Sacrament of the Altar</a>. He could, therefore, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> without form.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> An imperfect effect proves imperfection in the agent. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is an agent absolutely perfect; wherefore it is said of Him (<a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse4">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>): "The works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are perfect." Therefore the work of His creation was at no time formless. Further, the formation of corporeal creatures was effected by the work of distinction. But confusion is opposed to distinction, as formlessness to form. It, therefore, formlessness preceded in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> the formation of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, it follows that at the beginning confusion, called by the ancients chaos, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in the corporeal creation.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> On this point <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men differ in opinion. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> for instance (Gen. ad lit. i, 15), <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> that the formlessness of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> was not prior in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> to its formation, but only in origin or the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, whereas others, as <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a> (Hom. ii In Hexaem.), <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> (In Hexaem. i), and <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> (Hom. ii In Gen.), hold that formlessness of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> preceded in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> its formation. And although these opinions seem mutually contradictory, in reality they differ but little; for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> takes the formlessness of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in a different sense from the others. In his sense it means the absence of all form, and if we thus understand it we cannot say that the formlessness of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> was prior in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> either to its formation or to its distinction. As to formation, the argument is clear. For it formless <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> preceded in duration, it already <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>; for this is implied by duration, since the end of creation is being in act: and act itself is a form. To say, then, that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> preceded, but without form, is to say that being <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> actually, yet without act, which is a contradiction in terms. Nor can it be said that it possessed some common form, on which afterwards supervened the different forms that distinguish it. For this would be to hold the opinion of the ancient <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, who maintained that primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> was some corporeal thing in act, as fire, air, water, or some intermediate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Hence, it followed that to be made means merely to be changed; for since that preceding form bestowed actual <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> being, and made some particular thing to be, it would result that the supervening form would not simply make an actual being, but 'this' actual being; which is the proper effect of an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> form. Thus the consequent forms would be merely <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, implying not generation, but alteration. Hence we must assert that primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> was not <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> altogether formless, nor under any one common form, but under distinct forms. And so, if the formlessness of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> be taken as referring to the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, which in itself is formless, this formlessness did not precede in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> its formation or distinction, but only in origin and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says; in the same way as <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> is prior to act, and the part to the whole. But the other <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> writers understand by formlessness, not the exclusion of all form, but the absence of that beauty and comeliness which are now apparent in the corporeal creation. Accordingly they say that the formlessness of corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> preceded its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> in duration. And so, when this is considered, it appears that <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> agrees with them in some respects, and in others disagrees, as will be shown later (69, 1; 74, 2).

<p>As far as may be gathered from the text of Genesis a threefold beauty was wanting to corporeal creatures, for which reason they are said to be without form. For the beauty of light was wanting to all that transparent body which we call the heavens, whence it is said that "darkness was upon the fact of the deep." And the earth lacked beauty in two ways: first, that beauty which it acquired when its watery veil was withdrawn, and so we read that "the earth was void," or "invisible," inasmuch as the waters covered and concealed it from view; secondly, that which it derives from being adorned by herbs and plants, for which reason it is called "empty," or, according to another reading [<a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>], "shapeless"--that is, unadorned. Thus after mention of two <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and the earth, the formlessness of the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is indicated by the words, "darkness was upon the face of the deep," since the air is included under <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>; and the formlessness of the earth, by the words, "the earth was void and empty."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The word earth is taken differently in this passage by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, and by other writers. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> holds that by the words "earth" and "water," in this passage. primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> itself is signified on account of its being impossible for <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> to make the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of such <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> intelligible to an <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> people, except under the similitude of well-<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> objects. Hence he uses a variety of figures in speaking of it, calling it not water only, nor earth only, lest they should think it to be in very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> water or earth. At the same time it has so far a likeness to earth, in that it is susceptible of form, and to water in its adaptability to a variety of forms. In this respect, then, the earth is said to be "void and empty," or "invisible and shapeless," that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by means of form. Hence, considered in itself, it is called "invisible" or "void," and its <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> is completed by form; thus <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> says that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is "place" [Timaeus, quoted by <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, Phys. iv, text. 15. But other <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> writers understand by earth the element of earth, and we have said (1) how, in this sense, the earth was, according to them, without form.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> produces effect in act from being in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>; and consequently in the operations of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> must precede act in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, and formlessness precede form. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> produces being in act out of nothing, and can, therefore, produce a perfect thing in an instant, according to the greatness of His power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Accident, inasmuch as it is a form, is a kind of act; whereas <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as such, is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> being in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. Hence it is more repugnant that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> should be in act without form, than for <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> to be without subject.

<p>In reply to the first argument in the contrary sense, we say that if, according to some <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> writers, formlessness was prior in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> to the informing of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, this arose, not from want of power on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> part, but from His wisdom, and from the design of preserving due order in the disposition of creatures by developing perfection from imperfection.

<p>In reply to the second argument, we say that certain of the ancient <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> maintained confusion devoid of all distinction; except Anaxagoras, who taught that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> alone was distinct and without admixture. But previous to the work of distinction <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Scripture</a> enumerates several kinds of differentiation, the first being that of the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> from the earth, in which even a material distinction is expressed, as will be shown later (3; 68, 1). This is signified by the words, "In the beginning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth." The second distinction mentioned is that of the elements according to their forms, since both earth and water are named. That air and fire are not mentioned by name is due to the fact that the corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of these would not be so evident as that of earth and water, to the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> people to whom <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> spoke. <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> (Timaeus xxvi), nevertheless, understood air to be signified by the words, "<a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>," since spirit is another name for air, and considered that by the word <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is meant fire, for he held <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> to be composed of fire, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> relates (De Civ. Dei viii, 11). But <a href="../cathen/09540b.htm">Rabbi Moses</a> (Perplex. ii), though otherwise agreeing with <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, says that fire is signified by the word darkness, since, said he, fire does not shine in its own sphere. However, it seems more reasonable to hold to what we stated above; because by the words "<a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>" <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> usually means the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, Who is said to "move over the waters," not, indeed, in bodily shape, but as the craftsman's will may be said to move over the material to which he intends to give a form. The third distinction is that of place; since the earth is said to be under the waters that rendered it invisible, whilst the air, the subject of darkness, is described as being above the waters, in the words: "Darkness was upon the face of the deep." The remaining distinctions will appear from what follows (71).

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the formless matter of all corporeal things is the same?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the formless <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of all corporeal things is the same. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. xii, 12): "I find two things Thou hast made, one formed, the other formless," and he says that the latter was the earth invisible and shapeless, whereby, he says, the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of all corporeal things is designated. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of all corporeal things is the same.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. v, text. 10): "Things that are one in genus are one in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>." But all corporeal things are in the same genus of body. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of all bodies is the same.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, different acts befit different potentialities, and the same act befits the same <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. But all bodies have the same form, corporeity. Therefore all bodies have the same <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, considered in itself, is only in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. But distinction is due to form. Therefore <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> considered in itself is the same in all corporeal things.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Things of which the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is the same are mutually interchangeable and mutually active or passive, as is said (De Gener. i, text. 50). But heavenly and earthly bodies do not act upon each other mutually. Therefore their <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is not the same.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> On this question the opinions of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> have differed. <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> and all who preceded <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> held that all bodies are of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the four elements. Hence because the four elements have one common <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as their mutual generation and corruption <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>, it followed that the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of all bodies is the same. But the fact of the incorruptibility of some bodies was ascribed by <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, not to the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the artificer, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Whom he represents as saying to the heavenly bodies: "By your own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> you are subject to dissolution, but by My will you are indissoluble, for My <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is more powerful than the link that binds you together." But this theory <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> (De Caelo i, text. 5) disproves by the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> movements of bodies. For since, he says, the heavenly bodies have a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> movement, different from that of the elements, it follows that they have a different <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> from them. For movement in a circle, which is proper to the heavenly bodies, is not by contraries, whereas the movements of the elements are mutually opposite, one tending upwards, another downwards: so, therefore, the heavenly body is without contrariety, whereas the elemental bodies have contrariety in their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. And as generation and corruption are from contraries, it follows that, whereas the elements are corruptible, the heavenly bodies are incorruptible. But in spite of this difference of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> corruption and incorruption, Avicebron taught unity of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in all bodies, arguing from their unity of form. And, indeed, if corporeity were one form in itself, on which the other forms that distinguish bodies from each other supervene, this argument would <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; for this form of corporeity would inhere in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> immutably and so far all bodies would be incorruptible. But corruption would then be merely <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> through the disappearance of successive forms--that is to say, it would be corruption, not pure and simple, but partial, since a being in act would subsist under the transient form. Thus the ancient <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> taught that the substratum of bodies was some actual being, such as air or fire. But supposing that no form <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in corruptible bodies which remains subsisting beneath generation and corruption, it follows <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> that the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of corruptible and incorruptible bodies is not the same. For <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as it is in itself, is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to form.

<p>Considered in itself, then, it is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> in respect to all those forms to which it is common, and in receiving any one form it is in act only as regards that form. Hence it remains in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to all other forms. And this is the case even where some forms are more perfect than others, and contain these others virtually in themselves. For <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> in itself is indifferent with respect to perfection and imperfection, so that under an imperfect form it is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to a perfect form, and "vice versa." Matter, therefore, whilst <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> under the form of an incorruptible body, would be in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to the form of a corruptible body; and as it does not actually possess the latter, it has both form and the privation of form; for want of a form in that which is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> thereto is privation. But this <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> implies corruptibility. It is therefore impossible that bodies by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> corruptible, and those by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> incorruptible, should possess the same <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p>Neither can we say, as <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Averroes</a> [De Substantia Orbis ii.] imagines, that a heavenly body itself is the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>--beings in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> with regard to place, though not to being, and that its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> is a separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> united to it as its motive force. For it is impossible to suppose any being in act, unless in its totality it be act and form, or be something which has act or form. Setting aside, then, in thought, the separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> stated to be endowed with motive power, if the heavenly body is not something having form--that is, something composed of a form and the subject of that form--it follows that in its totality it is form and act. But every such thing is something actually understood, which the heavenly bodies are not, being sensible. It follows, then, that the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the heavenly bodies, considered in itself, is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to that form alone which it actually possesses. Nor does it concern the point at issue to inquire whether this is a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> or any other thing. Hence this form perfects this matter in such a way that there remains in it no <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> with respect to being, but only to place, as <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> [De Coelo i, text. 20 says. So, then, the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the heavenly bodies and of the elements is not the same, except by analogy, in so far as they agree in the character of <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> follows in this the opinion of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, who does not admit a fifth <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Or we may say that formless <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is one with the unity of order, as all bodies are one in the order of corporeal creatures.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> If genus is taken in a physical sense, corruptible and incorruptible things are not in the same genus, on account of their different modes of <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, as is said in Metaph. x, text. 26. Logically considered, however, there is but one genus of all bodies, since they are all included in the one notion of corporeity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The form of corporeity is not one and the same in all bodies, being no other than the various forms by which bodies are distinguished, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> is directed towards act, <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a> beings are differentiated by their different acts, as sight is by color, hearing by sound. Therefore for this reason the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the celestial bodies is different from that of the elemental, because the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the celestial is not in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to an elemental form.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the empyrean heaven was created at the same time as formless matter?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the empyrean <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> was not <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> at the same time as formless <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. For the empyrean, if it is anything at all, must be a sensible body. But all sensible bodies are movable, and the empyrean <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is not movable. For if it were so, its movement would be ascertained by the movement of some visible body, which is not the case. The empyrean <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, then, was not <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> contemporaneously with formless <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iii, 4) that "the lower bodies are governed by the higher in a certain order." If, therefore, the empyrean <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is the highest of bodies, it must <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> exercise some influence on bodies below it. But this does not seem to be the case, especially as it is presumed to be without movement; for one body cannot move another unless itself also be moved. Therefore the empyrean <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> was not <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> together with formless <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if it is held that the empyrean <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is the place of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, and not ordained to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> effects; on the contrary, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iv, 20): "In so far as we <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mentally</a> apprehend <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> things, so far are we not of this world"; from which it is clear that <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> lifts the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> above the things of this world. Corporeal place, therefore, cannot be the seat of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, among the heavenly bodies <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> a body, partly transparent and partly luminous, which we call the sidereal heaven. There <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> also a <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> wholly transparent, called by some the aqueous or crystalline <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. If, then, there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> a still higher <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, it must be wholly luminous. But this cannot be, for then the air would be constantly illuminated, and there would be no night. Therefore the empyrean <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> was not <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> together with formless <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Strabus says that in the passage, "In the beginning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth," <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> denotes not the visible <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a>, but the empyrean or fiery <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The empyrean <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> rests only on the authority of Strabus and <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>, and also of <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a>; all of whom agree in one respect, namely, in holding it to be the place of the blessed. Strabus and <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> say that as soon as <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> it was filled with <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; and <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a> [Hom. ii. in Hexaem.] says: "Just as the lost are driven into the lowest darkness, so the reward for worthy <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> is laid up in the light beyond this world, where the just shall obtain the abode of rest." But they differ in the reasons on which they base their statement. Strabus and <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> teach that there is an empyrean <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a>, which they take to mean the sidereal <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, is said to have been made, not in the beginning, but on the second day: whereas the reason given by <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a> is that otherwise <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would seem to have made darkness His first work, as the Manicheans <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> assert, when they call the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of darkness. These reasons, however, are not very cogent. For the question of the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a>, said to have been made on the second day, is solved in one way by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, and in another by other <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> writers. But the question of the darkness is explained according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [Gen. ad lit. i; vii.], by supposing that formlessness, signified by darkness, preceded form not by duration, but by origin. According to others, however, since darkness is no creature, but a privation of light, it is a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of Divine wisdom, that the things it <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> from nothing it produced first of all in an imperfect state, and afterwards brought them to perfection. But a better reason can be drawn from the state of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> itself. For in the reward to come a two-fold <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is looked for, <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and corporeal, not only in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body to be glorified, but in the whole world which is to be made new. Now the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> began with the beginning of the world, in the blessedness of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, equality with whom is promised to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. It was fitting, then, that even from the beginning, there should be made some beginning of bodily <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in something corporeal, free at the very outset from the servitude of corruption and change, and wholly luminous, even as the whole bodily creation, after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">Resurrection</a>, is expected to be. So, then, that <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is called the empyrean, i.e. fiery, not from its heat, but from its brightness. It is to be noticed, however, that <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei x, 9,27) says that Porphyry sets the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> apart from the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> by supposing that the former inhabit the air, the latter the ether, or empyrean. But Porphyry, as a <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonist</a>, held the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as sidereal, to be fiery, and therefore called it empyrean or ethereal, taking ethereal to denote the burning of flame, and not as <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> understands it, swiftness of movement (De Coel. i, text. 22). This much has been said to prevent anyone from supposing that <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> maintained an empyrean <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> in the sense understood by modern writers.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Sensible corporeal things are movable in the present state of the world, for by the movement of corporeal creatures is secured by the multiplication of the elements. But when <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is finally consummaed, the movement of bodies will cease. And such must have been from the beginning the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the empyrean.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is sufficiently probable, as some assert, that the empyrean <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, having the state of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for its ordained end, does not influence inferior bodies of another order--those, namely, that are directed only to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> ends. Yet it seems still more probable that it does influence bodies that are moved, though itself motionless, just as <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of the highest rank, who assist [Infra, 112, 3], influence those of lower degree who act as messengers, though they themselves are not sent, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> teaches (Coel. Hier. xii). For this reason it may be said that the influence of the empyrean upon that which is called the first <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and is moved, produces therein not something that comes and goes as a result of movement, but something of a fixed and stable <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as the power of conservation or causation, or something of the kind pertaining to dignity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Corporeal place is assigned to <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, not as <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, but as congruous, that the splendor without may correspond to that which is within. Hence <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a> (Hom. ii in Hexaem.) says: "The ministering spirit could not live in darkness, but made his <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> dwelling in light and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a> says (Hom. ii in Hexaem.): "It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> spherical in shape, of dense body, and sufficiently strong to separate what is outside it from what it encloses. On this account it darkens the region external to it, the light by which itself is lit up being shut out from that region. "But since the body of the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a>, though solid, is transparent, for that it does not exclude light (as is clear from the fact that we can see the stars through the intervening heavens), we may also say that the empyrean has light, not condensed so as to emit rays, as the sun does, but of a more subtle <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Or it may have the brightness of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which differs from mere <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> brightness.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether time was created simultaneously with formless matter?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that time was not <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> simultaneously with formless <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. xii, 12): "I find two things that Thou didst create before time was, the primary corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." Therefore time was not <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> with formless <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, time is divided by day and night. But in the beginning there was neither day nor night, for these began when "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> divided the light from the darkness." Therefore in the beginning time was not.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, time is the measure of the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament's</a> movement; and the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> is said to have been made on the second day. Therefore in the beginning time was not.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, movement precedes time, and therefore should be reckoned among the first things <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>, rather than time.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, as time is the extrinsic measure of <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things, so is place. Place, then, as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> as time, must be reckoned among the things first <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. i, 3): "Both <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and corporeal creatures were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> at the beginning of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is commonly said that the first things <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> were these four--the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the empyrean <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, formless corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and time. It must be observed, however, that this is not the opinion of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>. For he (Confess. xii, 12) specifies only two things as first <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>--the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>--making no mention of the empyrean <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. But these two, namely, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and formless <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, precede the formation, by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> only, and not by duration; and therefore, as they precede formation, so do they precede movement and time. <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">Time</a>, therefore, cannot be included among them. But the enumeration above given is that of other <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> writers, who hold that the formlessness of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> preceded by duration its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, and this view postulates the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of time as the measure of duration: for otherwise there would be no such measure.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The teaching of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> rests on the opinion that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and formless <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> precede time by origin or <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As in the opinion of some <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> writers <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> was in some measure formless before it received its full form, so time was in a manner formless before it was fully formed and distinguished into day and night.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If the movement of the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> did not begin immediately from the beginning, then the time that preceded was the measure, not of the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament's</a> movement, but of the first movement of whatsoever kind. For it is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to time to be the measure of the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament's</a> movement, in so far as this is the first movement. But if the first movement was another than this, time would have been its measure, for everything is measured by the first of its kind. And it must be granted that forthwith from the beginning, there was movement of some kind, at least in the succession of concepts and affections in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> mind: while movement without time cannot be conceived, since time is nothing else than "the measure of priority and succession in movement."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Among the first <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things are to be reckoned those which have a general relationship to things. And, therefore, among these time must be included, as having the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a common measure; but not movement, which is related only to the movable subject.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Place is implied as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the empyrean <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, this being the boundary of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. And since place has reference to things permanent, it was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> at once in its totality. But time, as not being permanent, was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in its beginning: even as actually we cannot lay hold of any part of time save the "now."
