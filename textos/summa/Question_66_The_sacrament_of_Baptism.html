<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether Baptism is the mere washing?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is not the mere washing. For the washing of the body is something transitory: but <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is something permanent. Therefore <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is not the mere washing; but rather is it "the regeneration, the seal, the safeguarding, the enlightenment," as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iv).

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugh of St. Victor</a> says (De Sacram. ii) that "<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is water sanctified by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> word for the blotting out of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." But the washing itself is not water, but a certain use of water.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. lxxx super Joan.): "The word is added to the element, and this becomes a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>." Now, the element is the water. Therefore <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is the water and not the washing.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/sir034.htm#verse30">Sirach 34:30</a>): "He that washeth himself [baptizatur] after touching the dead, if he touch him again, what does his washing avail?" It seems, therefore, that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is the washing or bathing.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a>, three things may be considered: namely, that which is "sacrament only"; that which is "reality and sacrament"; and that which is "reality only." That which is sacrament only, is something visible and outward; the sign, namely, of the inward effect: for such is the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. And this outward something that can be perceived by the sense is both the water itself and its use, which is the washing. Hence some have thought that the water itself is the sacrament: which seems to be the meaning of the passage quoted from <a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugh of St. Victor</a>. For in the general definition of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> he says that it is "a material element": and in defining <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> he says it is "water."

<p>But this is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. For since the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> effect a certain sanctification, there the sacrament is completed where the sanctification is completed. Now, the sanctification is not completed in water; but a certain sanctifying instrumental <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, not permanent but transient, passes from the water, in which it is, into <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who is the subject of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sanctification. Consequently the sacrament is not completed in the very water, but in applying the water to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, i.e. in the washing. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> (iv, 3) says that "<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is the outward washing of the body done together with the prescribed form of words."

<p>The Baptismal character is both reality and sacrament: because it is something real signified by the outward washing; and a sacramental sign of the inward <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>: and this last is the reality only, in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>--namely, the reality signified and not signifying.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> That which is both sacrament and reality--i.e. the character--and that which is reality only--i.e. the inward <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>--remain: the character remains and is indelible, as stated above (Question 63, Article 5); the justification remains, but can be lost. Consequently <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> defined <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, not as to that which is done outwardly, and is the sacrament only; but as to that which is inward. Hence he sets down two things as pertaining to the character--namely, "seal" and "safeguarding"; inasmuch as the character which is called a seal, so far as itself is concerned, safeguards the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. He also sets down two things as pertaining to the ultimate reality of the sacrament--namely, "regeneration" which refers to the fact that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> begins the new life of righteousness; and "enlightenment," which refers especially to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, by which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> receives <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life, according to <a href="../bible/hab002.htm">Habakkuk 2</a> (<a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse38">Hebrews 10:38</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/hab002.htm#verse4">Habakkuk 2:4</a>): "But (My) just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> liveth by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>"; and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is a sort of protestation of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; whence it is called the "Sacrament of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>." Likewise <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> defined <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> by its relation to the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, saying (Eccl. Hier. ii) that it is "the principle that forms the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> for the reception of those most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> words and <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>"; and again by its relation to heavenly <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, which is the universal end of all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, when he adds, "preparing the way for us, whereby we mount to the repose of the heavenly kingdom"; and again as to the beginning of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life, when he adds, "the conferring of our most sacred and Godlike regeneration."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As already stated, the opinion of <a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugh of St. Victor</a> on this question is not to be followed. Nevertheless the saying that "<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is water" may be verified in so far as water is the material principle of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>: and thus there would be "<a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causal</a> predication."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> When the words are added, the element becomes a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, not in the element itself, but in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, to whom the element is applied, by being used in washing him. Indeed, this is signified by those very words which are added to the element, when we say: "I <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> thee," etc.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether Baptism was instituted after Christ's Passion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> was instituted after <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> precedes the effect. Now <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> operates in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> precedes the institution of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>: especially the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> since the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse3">Romans 6:3</a>): "All we, who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in His death," etc.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> derive their efficacy from the mandate of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> gave the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> the mandate of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> after His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> and <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, when He said: "Going, teach ye all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> them in the name of the Father," etc. (<a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew 28:19</a>). Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> was instituted after <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> sacrament, as stated above ([65], 4): wherefore, seemingly, it must have been binding on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as soon as it was instituted. But before <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> men were not bound to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>: for Circumcision was still in force, which was supplanted by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> was not instituted before <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a sermon on the Epiphany (Append. Serm., clxxxv): "As soon as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was plunged into the waters, the waters washed away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of all." But this was before <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> was instituted before <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 62, Article 1), <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> derive from their institution the power of conferring <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Wherefore it seems that a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is then instituted, when it receives the power of producing its effect. Now <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> received this power when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. Consequently <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> instituted then, if we consider it as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of receiving this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> was proclaimed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> after the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> and <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>. First, because <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> put an end to the figurative <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, which were supplanted by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> and the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>. Secondly, because by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is "made conformable" to <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> and <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, in so far as he dies to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and begins to live anew unto righteousness. Consequently it behooved <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to suffer and to rise again, before proclaiming to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> his <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of conforming himself to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Death and <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Even before <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, inasmuch as it foreshadowed it, derived its efficacy therefrom; but not in the same way as the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. For these were mere figures: whereas <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> derived the power of justifying from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself, to Whose power the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> itself owed its saving <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It was not meet that men should be restricted to a number of figures by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who came to fulfil and replace the figure by His reality. Therefore before His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> He did not make <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> obligatory as soon as it was instituted; but wished men to become accustomed to its use; especially in regard to the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, to whom all things were figurative, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Faust. iv). But after His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> and <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> He made <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> obligatory, not only on the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, but also on the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, when He gave the commandment: "Going, teach ye all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Sacraments are not obligatory except when we are commanded to receive them. And this was not before the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, as stated above. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> words to Nicodemus (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse5">John 3:5</a>), "Unless a man be born again of water and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, he cannot enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, seem to refer to the future rather than to the present."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether water is the proper matter of Baptism?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that water is not the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Eccl. Hier. v) and <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. iv), has a power of enlightening. But enlightenment is a special characteristic of fire. Therefore <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> should be conferred with fire rather than with water: and all the more since <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a> said when foretelling <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> (<a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse11">Matthew 3:11</a>): "He shall <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> you in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and fire."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the washing away of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is signified in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. But many other things besides water are employed in washing, such as wine, oil, and such like. Therefore <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> can be conferred with these also; and consequently water is not the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> flowed from the side of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> hanging on the cross, as stated above (Question 62, Article 5). But not only water flowed therefrom, but also blood. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> can also be conferred with blood. And this seems to be more in keeping with the effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, because it is written (<a href="../bible/rev001.htm#verse5">Apocalypse 1:5</a>): "(Who) washed us from our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in His own blood."

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (cf. <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master of the Sentences</a>, iv, 3) and <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> (Exposit. in Luc. iii, 21) say, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by "the touch of His most pure flesh, endowed the waters with a regenerating and cleansing <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>." But all waters are not connected with the waters of the Jordan which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> touched with His flesh. Consequently it seems that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> cannot be conferred with any water; and therefore water, as such, is not the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, if water, as such, were the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, there would be no need to do anything to the water before using it for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. But in <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> the water which is used for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>, is exorcized and blessed. Therefore it seems that water, as such, is not the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse5">John 3:5</a>): "Unless a man be born again of water and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, he cannot enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> By Divine institution water is the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>; and with reason. First, by reason of the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, which is a regeneration unto <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life. And this answers to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of water in a special degree; wherefore seeds, from which all living things, viz. plants and animals are generated, are moist and akin to water. For this reason certain <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> held that water is the first principle of all things.

<p>Secondly, in regard to the effects of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, to which the properties of water correspond. For by reason of its moistness it cleanses; and hence it fittingly signifies and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the cleansing from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. By reason of its coolness it tempers superfluous heat: wherefore it fittingly mitigates the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the fomes. By reason of its transparency, it is susceptive of light; hence its adaptability to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> as the "sacrament of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>."

<p>Thirdly, because it is suitable for the signification of the mysteries of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by which we are justified. For, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. xxv in Joan.) on <a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse5">John 3:5</a>, "Unless a man be born again," etc., "When we dip our heads under the water as in a kind of tomb our old <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is buried, and being submerged is hidden below, and thence he rises again renewed."

<p>Fourthly, because by being so universal and abundant, it is a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> suitable to our need of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>: for it can easily be obtained everywhere.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Fire enlightens actively. But he who is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> does not become an enlightener, but is enlightened by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which "cometh by hearing" (<a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse17">Romans 10:17</a>). Consequently water is more suitable, than fire, for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p>But when we find it said: "He shall <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> you in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and fire," we may understand fire, as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (In Matth. ii), to mean the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, Who appeared above the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> under the form of fiery tongues (<a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse3">Acts 2:3</a>). Or we may understand it to mean tribulation, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. iii in Matth.): because tribulation washes away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and tempers <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. Or again, as <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (Super Matth. ii) that "when we have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>," we still have to be "perfected by the fire of the judgment."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Wine and oil are not so commonly used for washing, as water. Neither do they wash so efficiently: for whatever is washed with them, contracts a certain smell therefrom; which is not the case if water be used. Moreover, they are not so universal or so abundant as water.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Water flowed from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> side to wash us; blood, to redeem us. Wherefore blood belongs to the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, while water belongs to the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a>. Yet this latter sacrament derives its cleansing <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> from the power of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> blood.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> power flowed into all waters, by reason of, not connection of place, but likeness of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a sermon on the Epiphany (Append. Serm. cxxxv): "The <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> that flowed from the Saviour's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, like a mystic river, swelled the course of every stream, and filled the channels of every spring."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> of the water is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, but belongs to a certain <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a>, whereby the devotion of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> is aroused, and the cunning of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> hindered from impeding the baptismal effect.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether plain water is necessary for Baptism?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that plain water is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. For the water which we have is not plain water; as appears especially in sea-water, in which there is a considerable proportion of the earthly element, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> shows (Meteor. ii). Yet this water may be used for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Therefore plain and pure water is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> celebration of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, chrism is poured into the water. But this seems to take away the purity and plainness of the water. Therefore pure and plain water is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the water that flowed from the side of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> hanging on the cross was a figure of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, as stated above (3, ad 3). But that water, seemingly, was not pure, because the elements do not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> actually in a mixed body, such as Christ's. Therefore it seems that pure or plain water is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, lye does not seem to be pure water, for it has the properties of heating and drying, which are contrary to those of water. Nevertheless it seems that lye can be used for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>; for the water of the Baths can be so used, which has filtered through a sulphurous vein, just as lye percolates through ashes. Therefore it seems that plain water is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, rose-water is distilled from roses, just as chemical waters are distilled from certain bodies. But seemingly, such like waters may be used in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>; just as rain-water, which is distilled from vapors. Since, therefore, such waters are not pure and plain water, it seems that pure and plain water is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is water, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). But plain water alone has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of water. Therefore pure plain water is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Water may cease to be pure or plain water in two ways: first, by being mixed with another body; secondly, by alteration. And each of these may happen in a twofold manner; artificially and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>. Now art fails in the operation of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: because <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> gives the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form, which art cannot give; for whatever form is given by art is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>; except perchance when art applies a proper agent to its proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as fire to a combustible; in which manner animals are produced from certain things by way of putrefaction.

<p>Whatever artificial change, then, takes place in the water, whether by mixture or by alteration, the water's <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not changed. Consequently such water can be used for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>: unless perhaps such a small <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of water be mixed artificially with a body that the compound is something other than water; thus mud is earth rather than water, and diluted wine is wine rather than water.

<p>But if the change be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, sometimes it destroys the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the water; and this is when by a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> process water enters into the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of a mixed body: thus water changed into the juice of the grape is wine, wherefore it has not the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of water. Sometimes, however, there may be a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> change of the water, without destruction of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>: and this, both by alteration, as we may see in the case of water heated by the sun; and by mixture, as when the water of a river has become muddy by being mixed with particles of earth.

<p>We must therefore say that any water may be used for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, no matter how much it may be changed, as long as the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of water is not destroyed; but if the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of water be destroyed, it cannot be used for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The change in sea-water and in other waters which we have to hand, is not so great as to destroy the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of water. And therefore such waters may be used for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Chrism does not destroy the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the water by being mixed with it: just as neither is water changed wherein meat and the like are boiled: except the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> boiled be so dissolved that the liquor be of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> foreign to water; in this we may be guided by the specific gravity [spissitudine]. If, however, from the liquor thus thickened plain water be strained, it can be used for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>: just as water strained from mud, although mud cannot be used for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The water which flowed from the side of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> hanging on the cross, was not the phlegmatic humor, as some have supposed. For a liquid of this kind cannot be used for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, as neither can the blood of an animal, or wine, or any liquid extracted from plants. It was pure water gushing forth <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> like the blood from a dead body, to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the reality of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> body, and confute the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichees</a>: water, which is one of the four elements, showing <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body to be composed of the four elements; blood, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proving</a> that it was composed of the four humors.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> may be conferred with lye and the waters of Sulphur Baths: because such like waters are not incorporated, artificially or <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, with certain mixed bodies, and suffer only a certain alteration by passing through certain bodies.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Rose-water is a liquid distilled from roses: consequently it cannot be used for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. For the same reason chemical waters cannot be used, as neither can wine. Nor does the comparison hold with rain-water, which for the most part is formed by the condensing of vapors, themselves formed from water, and contains a minimum of the liquid <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> from mixed bodies; which liquid <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> by the force of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which is stronger than art, is transformed in this process of condensation into real water, a result which cannot be produced artificially. Consequently rain-water retains no properties of any mixed body; which cannot be said of rose-water or chemical waters.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether this be a suitable form of Baptism: "I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost"?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that this is not a suitable form of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>: "I <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." For action should be ascribed to the principal agent rather than to the minister. Now the minister of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> acts as an instrument, as stated above (Question 64, Article 1); while the principal agent in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse33">John 1:33</a>, "He upon Whom thou shalt see the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> descending and remaining upon Him, He it is that baptizeth." It is therefore unbecoming for the minister to say, "I <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> thee": the more so that "Ego" [I] is understood in the word "baptizo" [I <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, so that it seems redundant.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, there is no need for a man who does an action, to make mention of the action done; thus he who teaches, need not say, "I teach you." Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> gave at the same time the precepts both of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> and of teaching, when He said (<a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew 28:19</a>): "Going, teach ye all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>," etc. Therefore there is no need in the form of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> to mention the action of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> sometimes does not understand the words; for instance, if he be deaf, or a child. But it is useless to address such a one; according to <a href="../bible/sir032.htm#verse6">Sirach 32:6</a>: "Where there is no hearing, pour not out words." Therefore it is unfitting to address the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with these words: "I <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> thee."

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it may happen that several are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by several at the same time; thus the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> on one day <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> three thousand, and on another, five thousand (<a href="../bible/act002.htm">Acts 2</a>, <a href="../bible/act004.htm">4</a>). Therefore the form of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> should not be limited to the singular number in the words, "I <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> thee": but one should be able to say, "We <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> you."

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> derives its power from <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>. But <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is sanctified by the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> should be mentioned in the form of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, a name signifies a thing's property. But there are three Personal Properties of the Divine Persons, as stated in I, 32, 3. Therefore we should not say, "in the name," but "in the names of the Father, and of the Son, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 7.</strong> Further, the Person of the Father is designated not only by the name Father, but also by that of "Unbegotten and Begetter"; and the Son by those of "Word," "Image," and "Begotten"; and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> by those of "Gift," "Love," and the "Proceeding One." Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is valid if conferred in these names.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew 28:19</a>): "Going . . . teach ye all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> receives its <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> from its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, according to <a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse26">Ephesians 5:26</a>: "Cleansing it by the laver of water in the word of life." And <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Unico Baptismo iv) that "<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the words of the Gospel." Consequently the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> needs to be expressed in the baptismal form. Now this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is twofold; the principal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> from which it derives its <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and this is the Blessed <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>; and the instrumental <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, viz. the minister who confers the sacrament outwardly. Wherefore both <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> should be expressed in the form of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Now the minister is designated by the words, "I <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> thee"; and the principal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> in the words, "in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." Therefore this is the suitable form of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>: "I <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Action is attributed to an instrument as to the immediate agent; but to the principal agent inasmuch as the instrument acts in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> thereof. Consequently it is fitting that in the baptismal form the minister should be mentioned as performing the act of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>, in the words, "I <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> thee"; indeed, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> attributed to the ministers the act of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>, when He said: "Baptizing them," etc. But the principal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is indicated as conferring the sacrament by His own power, in the words, "in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>": for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> does not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> without the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p>The Greeks, however, do not attribute the act of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> to the minister, in order to avoid the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of those who in the past ascribed the baptismal power to the baptizers, saying (<a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 1:12</a>): "I am of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> . . . and I of <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Cephas</a>." Wherefore they use the form: "May the servant of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, N . . ., be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, in the name of the Father," etc. And since the action performed by the minister is expressed with the invocation of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, the sacrament is validly conferred. As to the addition of "Ego" in our form, it is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a>; but it is added in order to lay greater stress on the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Since a man may be washed with water for several reasons, the purpose for which it is done must be expressed by the words of the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. And this is not done by saying: "In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>"; because we are bound to do all things in that Name (<a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse17">Colossians 3:17</a>). Wherefore unless the act of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> be expressed, either as we do, or as the Greeks do, the sacrament is not valid; according to the decretal of <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>: "If anyone dip a child thrice in the water in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, without saying, I <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, the child is not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The words which are uttered in the sacramental forms, are said not merely for the purpose of signification, but also for the purpose of efficiency, inasmuch as they derive efficacy from that Word, by Whom "all things were made." Consequently they are becomingly addressed not only to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but also to insensible creatures; for instance, when we say: "I exorcize thee, creature salt" (Roman Ritual).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Several cannot <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> one at the same time: because an action is multiplied according to the number of the agents, if it be done perfectly by each. So that if two were to combine, of whom one were mute, and unable to utter the words, and the other were without hands, and unable to perform the action, they could not both <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> at the same time, one saying the words and the other performing the action.

<p>On the other hand, in a case of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, several could be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> at the same time; for no single one of them would receive more than one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. But it would be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, in that case, to say: "I <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> ye." Nor would this be a change of form, because "ye" is the same as "thee and thee." Whereas "we" does not mean "I and I," but "I and thou"; so that this would be a change of form.

<p>Likewise it would be a change of form to say, "I <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> myself": consequently no one can <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> himself. For this reason did <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> choose to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by John (Extra, De Baptismo et ejus effectu, cap. Debitum).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> is the principal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> as compared to the minister, yet it is an instrumental <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> as compared to the Blessed <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>. For this reason the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> is mentioned rather than <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> Although there are three personal names of the three Persons, there is but one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> name. Now the Divine power which works in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, pertains to the Essence; and therefore we say, "in the name," and not, "in the names."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 7.</strong> Just as water is used in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, because it is more commonly employed in washing, so for the purpose of designating the three Persons, in the form of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, those names are chosen, which are generally used, in a particular language, to signify the Persons. Nor is the sacrament valid if conferred in any other names.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether Baptism can be conferred in the name of Christ?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> can be conferred in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For just as there is "one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>," so is there "one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>" (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse5">Ephesians 4:5</a>). But it is related (<a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse12">Acts 8:12</a>) that "in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> they were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, both men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>." Therefore now also can <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> be conferred in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Spir. Sanct. i): "If you mention <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, you designate both the Father by Whom He was anointed, and the Son Himself, Who was anointed, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> with Whom He was anointed." But <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> can be conferred in the name of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>: therefore also in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, Pope Nicholas I, answering questions put to him by the Bulgars, said: "Those who have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, or only in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as we read in the <a href="../cathen/01117a.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a> (it is all the same, as <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Blessed Ambrose</a> saith), must not be rebaptized." But they would be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again if they had not been validly <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with that form. Therefore <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> can be celebrated in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by using this form: "I <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> thee in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Pope Pelagius II wrote to the Bishop Gaudentius: "If any people living in your Worship's neighborhood, avow that they have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of the Lord only, without any hesitation <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> them again in the name of the Blessed <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, when they come in quest of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>." Didymus, too, says (De Spir. Sanct.): "If indeed there be such a one with a mind so foreign to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> while omitting one of the aforesaid names," viz. of the three Persons, "he baptizes invalidly."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 64, Article 3), the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> derive their efficacy from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> institution. Consequently, if any of those things be omitted which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> instituted in regard to a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, it is invalid; save by special dispensation of Him Who did not bind His power to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> commanded the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> to be given with the invocation of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>. And consequently whatever is lacking to the full invocation of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, destroys the integrity of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p>Nor does it matter that in the name of one Person another is implied, as the name of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is implied in that of the Father, or that he who mentions the name of only one Person may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> aright in the Three; because just as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> requires sensible <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, so does it require a sensible form. Hence, for the validity of the sacrament it is not enough to imply or to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, unless the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> be expressed in sensible words. For this reason at <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, wherein was the source of the sanctification of our <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> was present in sensible signs: viz. the Father in the voice, the Son in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> in the dove.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It was by a special <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> that in the primitive Church the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; in order that the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which was hateful to <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, might become an object of veneration, in that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was given in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> at the invocation of that Name.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> here gives this reason why exception could, without inconsistency, be allowed in the primitive <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; namely, because the whole <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> is implied in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and therefore the form prescribed by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in the Gospel was observed in its integrity, at least implicitly.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Pope Nicolas confirms his words by quoting the two authorities given in the preceding objections: wherefore the answer to this is clear from the two solutions given above.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether immersion in water is necessary for Baptism?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that immersion in water is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Because it is written (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse5">Ephesians 4:5</a>): "One <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>." But in many parts of the world the ordinary way of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> is by immersion. Therefore it seems that there can be no <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> without immersion.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse3">Romans 6:3-4</a>): "All we who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in His death: for we are buried together with Him, by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> into death." But this is done by immersion: for <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says on <a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse5">John 3:5</a>: "Unless a man be born again of water and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>," etc.: "When we dip our heads under the water as in a kind of tomb, our old <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is buried, and being submerged, is hidden below, and thence he rises again renewed." Therefore it seems that immersion is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is valid without total immersion of the body, it would follow that it would be equally sufficient to pour water over any part of the body. But this seems unreasonable; since <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, to remedy which is the principal purpose of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, is not in only one part of the body. Therefore it seems that immersion is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, and that mere sprinkling is not enough.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse22">Hebrews 10:22</a>): "Let us draw near with a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> heart in fulness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, having our hearts sprinkled from an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and our bodies washed with clean water."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> water is put to the use of a washing of the body, whereby to signify the inward washing away of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Now washing may be done with water not only by immersion, but also by sprinkling or pouring. And, therefore, although it is safer to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> by immersion, because this is the more ordinary fashion, yet <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> can be conferred by sprinkling or also by pouring, according to <a href="../bible/eze036.htm#verse25">Ezekiel 36:25</a>: "I will pour upon you clean water," as also the Blessed Lawrence is related to have <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. And this especially in cases of urgency: either because there is a great number to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, as was clearly the case in <a href="../bible/act002.htm">Acts 2</a> and <a href="../bible/act004.htm">4</a>, where we read that on one day three thousand <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and on another five thousand: or through there being but a small supply of water, or through feebleness of the minister, who cannot hold up the candidate for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>; or through feebleness of the candidate, whose life might be endangered by immersion. We must therefore conclude that immersion is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> What is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to a thing does not diversify its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Now bodily washing with water is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>: wherefore <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is called a "laver," according to <a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse26">Ephesians 5:26</a>: "Cleansing it by the laver of water in the word of life." But that the washing be done this or that way, is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. And consequently such diversity does not destroy the oneness of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> burial is more clearly represented by immersion: wherefore this manner of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> is more frequently in use and more commendable. Yet in the other ways of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> it is represented after a fashion, albeit not so clearly; for no matter how the washing is done, the body of a man, or some part thereof, is put under water, just as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was put under the earth.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The principal part of the body, especially in relation to the exterior members, is the head, wherein all the senses, both interior and exterior, flourish. And therefore, if the whole body cannot be covered with water, because of the scarcity of water, or because of some other reason, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to pour water over the head, in which the principle of animal life is made manifest.

<p>And although <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is transmitted through the members that serve for procreation, yet those members are not to be sprinkled in preference to the head, because by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> the transmission of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> to the offspring by the act of procreation is not deleted, but the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is freed from the stain and debt of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which it has contracted. Consequently that part of the body should be washed in preference, in which the works of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are made manifest.

<p>Nevertheless in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> the remedy against <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> was affixed to the member of procreation; because He through Whom <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> was to be removed, was yet to be born of the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was signified by <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> according to <a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse11">Romans 4:11</a>.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether trine immersion is essential to Baptism?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that trine immersion is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a sermon on the Symbol, addressed to the Neophytes: "Rightly were you dipped three times, since you were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of the Trinity. Rightly were you dipped three times, because you were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, Who on the third day rose again from the dead. For that thrice repeated immersion reproduces the burial of the Lord by which you were buried with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>." Now both seem to be <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, namely, that in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> of Persons should be signified, and that we should be conformed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> burial. Therefore it seems that trine immersion is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> derive their efficacy from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> mandate. But trine immersion was commanded by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: for Pope Pelagius II wrote to Bishop Gaudentius: "The Gospel precept given by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, our Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, admonishes us to confer the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> to each one in the name of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> and also with trine immersion." Therefore, just as it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> to call on the name of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, so is it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> by trine immersion.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if trine immersion be not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, it follows that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> is conferred at the first immersion; so that if a second or third immersion be added, it seems that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is conferred a second or third time. which is absurd. Therefore one immersion does not suffice for the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a>, and trine immersion is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> thereto.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> wrote to the Bishop Leander: "It cannot be in any way reprehensible to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> an infant with either a trine or a single immersion: since the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> can be represented in the three immersions, and the unity of the Godhead in one immersion."

<p><strong>I answer that</strong> As stated above (7, ad 1), washing with water is of itself required for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, being <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the sacrament: whereas the mode of washing is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Consequently, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> in the words above quoted explains, both single and trine immersion are lawful considered in themselves; since one immersion signifies the oneness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death and of the Godhead; while trine immersion signifies the three days of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> burial, and also the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> of Persons.

<p>But for various reasons, according as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has ordained, one mode has been in practice, at one time, the other at another time. For since from the very earliest days of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> some have had <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> notions concerning the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, holding that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is a mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and that He is not called the "<a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>" or "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" except by reason of His <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, which was chiefly in His death; for this reason they did not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> in the name of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, but in memory of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death, and with one immersion. And this was condemned in the early Church. Wherefore in the Apostolic Canons (xlix) we read: "If any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> confer <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> not with the trine immersion in the one administration, but with one immersion, which <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is said to be conferred by some in the death of the Lord, let him be deposed": for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> did not say, "Baptize ye in My death," but "In the name of the Father and of the Son, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>."

<p>Later on, however, there arose the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of certain schismatics and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who rebaptized: as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Super. Joan., cf. De Haeres. lxix) relates of the Donatists. Wherefore, in detestation of their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, only one immersion was ordered to be made, by the (fourth) council of Toledo, in the acts of which we read: "In order to avoid the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> or the practice of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> teaching let us hold to the single baptismal immersion."

<p>But now that this motive has ceased, trine immersion is universally observed in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>: and consequently anyone <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> otherwise would <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> gravely, through not following the ritual of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It would, however, be valid <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> acts as principal agent in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Now the likeness of the agent enters into the effect, in regard to the form and not in regard to the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> is signified in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> by the words of the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Nor is it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> for the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> to be signified by the manner in which the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is used; although this is done to make the signification clearer.

<p>In like manner <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death is sufficiently represented in the one immersion. And the three days of His burial were not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, because even if He had been buried or dead for one day, this would have been enough to consummate our redemption: yet those three days were ordained unto the manifestation of the reality of His death, as stated above (Question 53, Article 2). It is therefore clear that neither on the part of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, nor on the part of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, is the trine immersion <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Pope Pelagius understood the trine immersion to be ordained by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in its equivalent; in the sense that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> commanded <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> to be conferred "in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." Nor can we argue from the form to the use of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as stated above (ad 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (Question 64, Article 8), the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Consequently, one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> results from the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> minister, who intends to confer one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> by a trine immersion. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on <a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse5">Ephesians 4:5-6</a>: "Though the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>," i.e. the immersion, "be thrice repeated, on account of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, yet it is reputed as one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>." If, however, the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> were to confer one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> at each immersion together with the repetition of the words of the form, it would be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in itself, because it would be a repetition of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether Baptism may be reiterated?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> may be reiterated. For <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> was instituted, seemingly, in order to wash away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are reiterated. Therefore much more should <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> be reiterated: because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> mercy surpasses <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> guilt.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a> received special commendation from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who said of him (<a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse11">Matthew 11:11</a>): "There hath not risen among them that are born of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, a greater than <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a>." But those whom John had <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again, according to <a href="../bible/act019.htm#verse1">Acts 19:1-7</a>, where it is stated that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> rebaptized those who had received the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of John. Much more, therefore, should those be rebaptized, who have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> or sinners.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it was decreed in the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a> (Can. xix) that if "any of the Paulianists or Cataphrygians should be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Church, they were to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>": and this seemingly should be said in regard to other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Therefore those whom the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. But sometimes there is a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of those who really have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. Therefore it seems that they should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is a more perfect sacrament than <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, as stated above (Question 65, Article 3). But the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is reiterated. Much more reason, therefore, is there for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> to be reiterated.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written, (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse5">Ephesians 4:5</a>): "One <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> cannot be reiterated.

<p>First, because <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> regeneration; inasmuch as a man dies to the old life, and begins to lead the new life. Whence it is written (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse5">John 3:5</a>): "Unless a man be born again of water and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, He cannot see [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'enter into'] the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>." Now one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can be begotten but once. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> cannot be reiterated, just as neither can carnal generation. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says on <a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse4">John 3:4</a>: "'Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born again': So thou," says he, "must understand the birth of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, as Nicodemus understood the birth of the flesh . . . . As there is no return to the womb, so neither is there to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>."

<p>Secondly, because "we are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death," by which we die unto <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and rise again unto "newness of life" (cf. <a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse3">Romans 6:3-4</a>). Now "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> died" but "once" (<a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse10">Romans 6:10</a>). Wherefore neither should <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> be reiterated. For this reason (<a href="../bible/heb006.htm#verse6">Hebrews 6:6</a>) is it said against some who wished to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again: "Crucifying again to themselves the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>"; on which the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> observes: "Christ's one death hallowed the one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>."

<p>Thirdly, because <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> imprints a character, which is indelible, and is conferred with a certain <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. Wherefore, just as other consecrations are not reiterated in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, so neither is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. This is the view expressed by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, who says (Contra Epist. Parmen. ii) that "the military character is not renewed": and that "the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not less enduring than this bodily mark, since we see that not even apostates are deprived of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, since when they repent and return they are not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> anew."

<p>Fourthly, because <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is conferred principally as a remedy against <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. Wherefore, just as <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is not renewed, so neither is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> reiterated, for as it is written (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse18">Romans 5:18</a>), "as by the offense of one, unto all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to condemnation, so also by the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of one, unto all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to justification of life."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> derives its efficacy from <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, as stated above (2, ad 1). Wherefore, just as subsequent <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> do not cancel the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, so neither do they cancel <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, so as to call for its repetition. on the other hand the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which hindered the effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is blotted out on being submitted to Penance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says on <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse33">John 1:33</a>: "'And I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him not': Behold; after John had <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> was administered; after a murderer has <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, it is not administered: because John gave his own <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>; the murderer, Christ's; for that sacrament is so sacred, that not even a murderer's administration contaminates it."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The Paulianists and Cataphrygians used not to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> in the name of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, writing to the Bishop Quiricus, says: "Those <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who are not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, such as the Bonosians and Cataphrygians" (who were of the same mind as the Paulianists), "since the former <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (holding Him to be a mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>), "while the latter," i.e. the Cataphrygians, "are so perverse as to deem a mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," viz. Montanus, "to be the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: all these are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> when they come to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church, for the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which they received while in that state of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> was no <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> at all, not being conferred in the name of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>." On the other hand, as set down in De Eccles. Dogm. xxii: "Those <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the confession of the name of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> are to be received as already <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> when they come to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a> of <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>: "Those about whose <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> there is a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> are to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with these words prefixed to the form: 'If thou art <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, I do not rebaptize thee; but if thou art not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, I <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> thee,' etc.: for that does not appear to be repeated, which is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to have been done."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Both <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, viz. <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, are a representation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> death and <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, but not in the same way. For <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is a commemoration of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death in so far as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> dies with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that he may be born again into a new life. But the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is a commemoration of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death, in so far as the suffering <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself is offered to us as the Paschal banquet, according to <a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse7">1 Corinthians 5:7-8</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> our pasch is sacrificed; therefore let us feast." And forasmuch as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is born once, whereas he eats many times, so is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> given once, but the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> frequently.

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether the Church observes a suitable rite in baptizing?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> observes an unsuitable rite in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>. For as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> (Chromatius, in Matth. 3:15) says: "The waters of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> would never avail to purge the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, had they not been hallowed by the touch of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> body." Now this took place at <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, which is commemorated in the Feast of the Epiphany. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> should be celebrated at the Feast of the Epiphany rather than on the eves of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> and Whitsunday.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it seems that several matters should not be used in the same sacrament. But water is used for washing in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Therefore it is unfitting that the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> should be anointed thrice with <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> oil first on the breast, and then between the shoulders, and a third time with chrism on the top of the head.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a> . . . there is neither male nor female" (<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse23">Galatians 3:23</a>) . . . "neither Barbarian nor Scythian" (<a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse11">Colossians 3:11</a>), nor, in like manner, any other such like distinctions. Much less, therefore can a difference of clothing have any efficacy in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. It is consequently unfitting to bestow a white garment on those who have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> can be celebrated without such like ceremonies. Therefore it seems that those mentioned above are superfluous; and consequently that they are unsuitably inserted by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the baptismal rite.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The Church is ruled by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, Who does nothing inordinate.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> something is done which is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, and something which belongs to a certain <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Essential indeed, to the sacrament are both the form which designates the principal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the sacrament; and the minister who is the instrumental <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; and the use of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, namely, washing with water, which designates the principal sacramental effect. But all the other things which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> observes in the baptismal rite, belong rather to a certain <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p>And these, indeed, are used in conjunction with the sacrament for three reasons. First, in order to arouse the devotion of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, and their reverence for the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. For if there were nothing done but a mere washing with water, without any <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a>, some might easily think it to be an ordinary washing.

<p>Secondly, for the instruction of the faithful. Because simple and unlettered folk need to be taught by some sensible signs, for instance, pictures and the like. And in this way by means of the sacramental ceremonies they are either instructed, or urged to seek the signification of such like sensible signs. And consequently, since, besides the principal sacramental effect, other things should be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> about <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, it was fitting that these also should be represented by some outward signs.

<p>Thirdly, because the power of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is restrained, by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, blessings, and the like, from hindering the sacramental effect.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> on the Epiphany with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of John, as stated above (Question 39, Article 2), with which <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, indeed, the faithful are not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, rather are they <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. This has its efficacy from the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion of Christ</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse3">Romans 6:3</a>: "We who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in His death"; and in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse5">John 3:5</a>: "Unless a man be born again of water and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." Therefore it is that <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is held in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, both on <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> Eve, when we commemorate our Lord's burial and <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>; for which reason <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> gave His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> the commandment concerning <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> as related by Matthew (28:19): and on Whitsun-eve, when the celebration of the Feast of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> begins; for which reason the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> are said to have <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> three thousand on the very day of Pentecost when they had received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The use of water in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is part of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the sacrament; but the use of oil or chrism is part of the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a>. For the candidate is first of all anointed with Holy oil on the breast and between the shoulders, as "one who wrestles for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," to use <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose's</a> expression (De Sacram. i): thus are prize-fighters wont to besmear themselves with oil. Or, as <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> says in a decretal on the Holy Unction: "The candidate is anointed on the breast, in order to receive the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, to cast off <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and to acknowledge the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, since 'the just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> liveth by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>'; while he is anointed between the shoulders, that he may be clothed with the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, lay aside indifference and sloth, and become active in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works; so that the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> may purify the thoughts of his heart, and strengthen his shoulders for the burden of labor." But after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, as <a href="../cathen/12617a.htm">Rabanus</a> says (De Sacram. iii), "he is forthwith anointed on the head by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> with Holy Chrism, who proceeds at once to offer up a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> that the neophyte may have a share in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> kingdom, and be called a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> after <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." Or, as <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Sacram. iii), his head is anointed, because "the senses of a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> are in his head" (<a href="../bible/ecc002.htm#verse14">Ecclesiastes 2:14</a>): to wit, that he may "be ready to satisfy everyone that asketh" him to give "a reason of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>" (cf. <a href="../bible/1pe003.htm#verse15">1 Peter 3:15</a>; <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a> on Holy Unction).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This white garment is given, not as though it were unlawful for the neophyte to use others: but as a sign of the glorious <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, unto which men are born again by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>; and in order to designate the purity of life, to which he will be bound after being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse4">Romans 6:4</a>: "That we may walk in newness of life."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Although those things that belong to the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> are not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to it, yet are they not superfluous, since they pertain to the sacrament's wellbeing, as stated above.

<h2 id="article11">Article 11. Whether three kinds of Baptism are fittingly described--viz. Baptism of Water, of Blood, and of the Spirit?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the three kinds of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> are not fittingly described as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of Water, of Blood, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, i.e. of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Because the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse5">Ephesians 4:5</a>): "One <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>." Now there is but one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. Therefore there should not be three Baptisms.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as we have made clear above (Question 65, Article 1). Now none but <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of Water is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Therefore we should not reckon two other Baptisms.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. iv) distinguishes several other kinds of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Therefore we should admit more than three Baptisms.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> on <a href="../bible/heb006.htm#verse2">Hebrews 6:2</a>, "Of the doctrine of Baptisms," the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "He uses the plural, because there is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of Water, of Repentance, and of Blood."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 62, Article 5), <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of Water has its efficacy from <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, to which a man is conformed by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, and also from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Now although the effect depends on the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> far surpasses the effect, nor does it depend on it. Consequently, a man may, without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of Water, receive the sacramental effect from <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, in so far as he is conformed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by suffering for Him. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/rev007.htm#verse14">Apocalypse 7:14</a>): "These are they who are come out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes and have made them white in the blood of the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a>." In like manner a man receives the effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> by the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, not only without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of Water, but also without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of Blood: forasmuch as his heart is moved by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in and love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to repent of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: wherefore this is also called <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of Repentance. Of this it is written (<a href="../bible/isa004.htm#verse4">Isaiah 4:4</a>): "If the Lord shall wash away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall wash away the blood of Jerusalem out of the midst thereof, by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning." Thus, therefore, each of these other Baptisms is called <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, forasmuch as it takes the place of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Unico Baptismo Parvulorum iv): "The <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Blessed Cyprian</a> argues with considerable reason from the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a> to whom, though not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, it was said: 'Today shalt thou be with Me in Paradise' that suffering can take the place of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Having weighed this in my mind again and again, I perceive that not only can suffering for the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> supply for what was lacking in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, but even <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and conversion of heart, if perchance on account of the stress of the times the celebration of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is not practicable."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The other two Baptisms are included in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of Water, which derives its efficacy, both from <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> and from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Consequently for this reason the unity of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is not destroyed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above (Question 60, Article 1), a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is a kind of sign. The other two, however, are like the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of Water, not, indeed, in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of sign, but in the baptismal effect. Consequently they are not <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> enumerates certain figurative Baptisms. For instance, "the <a href="../cathen/04702a.htm">Deluge</a>" was a figure of our <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, in respect of the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the faithful in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; since then "a few . . . <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> were saved in the ark [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'by water'," according to <a href="../bible/1pe003.htm#verse20">1 Peter 3:20</a>. He also mentions "the crossing of the Red Sea": which was a figure of our <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, in respect of our delivery from the bondage of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse2">1 Corinthians 10:2</a>) that "all . . . were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the cloud and in the sea." And again he mentions "the various washings which were customary under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>," which were figures of our <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, as to the cleansing from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: also "the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of John," which prepared the way for our <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<h2 id="article12">Article 12. Whether the Baptism of Blood is the most excellent of these?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of Blood is not the most excellent of these three. For the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of Water impresses a character; which the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of Blood cannot do. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of Blood is not more excellent than the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of Water.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of Blood is of no avail without the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, which is by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; for it is written (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse3">1 Corinthians 13:3</a>): "If I should deliver my body to be burned, and have not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, it profiteth me nothing." But the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> avails without the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of Blood; for not only the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> are saved. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of Blood is not the most excellent.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of Water derives its efficacy from <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, to which, as stated above (<a href="#11">Article 11</a>), the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of Blood corresponds, so <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> derives its efficacy from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, according to <a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse14">Hebrews 9:14</a>: "The Blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> offered Himself unspotted unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, shall cleanse our <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> from dead works," etc. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> is more excellent than the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of Blood. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of Blood is not the most excellent.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Ad Fortunatum) speaking of the comparison between Baptisms says: "The newly <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> confesses his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>: the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutor</a>. The former is sprinkled with water, after he has confessed; the latter with his blood. The former receives the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> by the imposition of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> hands; the latter is made the temple of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#11">Article 11</a>), the shedding of blood for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake, and the inward operation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, are called baptisms, in so far as they produce the effect of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of Water. Now the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of Water derives its efficacy from <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> and from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as already stated (11). These two <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> act in each of these three Baptisms; most excellently, however, in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of Blood. For <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> acts in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of Water by way of a figurative representation; in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> or of Repentance, by way of desire. but in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of Blood, by way of imitating the (Divine) act. In like manner, too, the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> acts in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of Water through a certain hidden power. in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of Repentance by moving the heart; but in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of Blood by the highest degree of fervor of dilection and love, according to <a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse13">John 15:13</a>: "Greater love than this no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hath that a man lay down his life for his friends."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A character is both reality and a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. And we do not say that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of Blood is more excellent, considering the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; but considering the sacramental effect.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The shedding of blood is not in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> if it be without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Hence it is clear that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of Blood includes the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, but not conversely. And from this it is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be more perfect.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> owes its pre-eminence not only to <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, but also to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as stated above.
