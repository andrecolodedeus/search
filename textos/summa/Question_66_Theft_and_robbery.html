<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether it is natural for man to possess external things?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to possess external things. For no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should ascribe to himself that which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a>. Now the dominion over all creatures is proper to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa023.htm#verse1">Psalm 23:1</a>, "The earth is the Lord's," etc. Therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to possess external things.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a> in expounding the words of the rich <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> (<a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse18">Luke 12:18</a>), "I will gather all things that are grown to me, and my goods," says [Hom. in Luc. xii, 18]: "Tell me: which are thine? where did you take them from and bring them into being?" Now whatever <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> possesses <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, he can fittingly call his own. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> possess external things.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> (De Trin. i [De Fide, ad Gratianum, i, 1) "dominion denotes power." But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has no power over external things, since he can work no change in their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore the possession of external things is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa008.htm#verse8">Psalm 8:8</a>): "Thou hast subjected all things under his feet."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> External things can be considered in two ways. First, as regards their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and this is not subject to the power of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but only to the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Whose mere will all things obey. Secondly, as regards their use, and in this way, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> dominion over external things, because, by his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> and will, he is able to use them for his own profit, as they were made on his account: for the imperfect is always for the sake of the perfect, as stated above (Question 64, Article 1). It is by this argument that the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proves (Polit. i, 3) that the possession of external things is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Moreover, this <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> dominion of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> over other creatures, which is competent to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in respect of his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> wherein <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> image resides, is shown forth in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> creation (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis 1:26</a>) by the words: "Let us make <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to our image and likeness: and let him have dominion over the fishes of the sea," etc.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has sovereign dominion over all things: and He, according to His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, directed certain things to the sustenance of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> body. For this reason <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> dominion over things, as regards the power to make use of them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The rich <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is reproved for deeming external things to belong to him principally, as though he had not received them from another, namely from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument considers the dominion over external things as regards their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Such a dominion belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, as stated above.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether it is lawful for a man to possess a thing as his own?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem unlawful for a man to possess a thing as his own. For whatever is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> is unlawful. Now according to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> all things are common property: and the possession of property is contrary to this community of goods. Therefore it is unlawful for any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to appropriate any external thing to himself.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a> in expounding the words of the rich <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> quoted above (1, Objection 2), says: "The rich who deem as their own property the common goods they have seized upon, are like to those who by going beforehand to the play prevent others from coming, and appropriate to themselves what is intended for common use." Now it would be unlawful to prevent others from obtaining possession of common goods. Therefore it is unlawful to appropriate to oneself what belongs to the community.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says [Serm. lxiv, de temp.], and his words are quoted in the Decretals [Dist. xlvii., Can. Sicut hi.]: "Let no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> call his own that which is common property": and by "common" he means external things, as is clear from the context. Therefore it seems unlawful for a man to appropriate an external thing to himself.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Haeres., haer. 40): "The 'Apostolici' are those who with extreme arrogance have given themselves that name, because they do not admit into their communion <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> or possess anything of their own, such as both <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> who in considerable number are to be found in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Church." Now the reason why these people are <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> was because severing themselves from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, they think that those who enjoy the use of the above things, which they themselves lack, have no hope of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Therefore it is <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> to maintain that it is unlawful for a man to possess property.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Two things are competent to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in respect of exterior things. One is the power to procure and dispense them, and in this regard it is lawful for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to possess property. Moreover this is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life for three reasons. First because every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is more careful to procure what is for himself alone than that which is common to many or to all: since each one would shirk the labor and leave to another that which concerns the community, as happens where there is a great number of servants. Secondly, because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs are conducted in more orderly fashion if each <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is charged with taking care of some particular thing himself, whereas there would be confusion if everyone had to look after any one thing indeterminately. Thirdly, because a more peaceful state is ensured to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> if each one is contented with his own. Hence it is to be observed that quarrels arise more frequently where there is no division of the things possessed.

<p>The second thing that is competent to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with regard to external things is their use. On this respect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ought to possess external things, not as his own, but as common, so that, to wit, he is ready to communicate them to others in their need. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse17">1 Timothy 6:17-18</a>): "Charge the rich of this world . . . to give easily, to communicate to others," etc.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Community of goods is ascribed to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, not that the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> dictates that all things should be possessed in common and that nothing should be possessed as one's own: but because the division of possessions is not according to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, but rather arose from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> agreement which belongs to positive <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, as stated above (57, 2,3). Hence the ownership of possessions is not contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, but an addition thereto devised by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would not act unlawfully if by going beforehand to the play he prepared the way for others: but he acts unlawfully if by so doing he hinders others from going. On like manner a rich <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not act unlawfully if he anticipates someone in taking possession of something which at first was common property, and gives others a share: but he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> if he excludes others indiscriminately from using it. Hence <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a> says (Hom. in Luc. xii, 18): "Why are you rich while another is poor, unless it be that you may have the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> stewardship, and he the reward of patience?"

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> When <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says: "Let no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> call his own that which is common," he is speaking of ownership as regards use, wherefore he adds: "He who spends too much is a robber."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the essence of theft consists in taking another's thing secretly?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> to take another's thing secretly. For that which diminishes a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, does not, apparently, belong to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> secretly tends to diminish a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, just as, on the contrary, it is written as indicating an aggravating circumstance of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of some (<a href="../bible/isa003.htm#verse9">Isaiah 3:9</a>): "They have proclaimed abroad their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as Sodom, and they have not hid it." Therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> that it should consist in taking another's thing secretly.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says [Serm. lxiv, de temp., 2, Objection 3, Can. Sicut hi.]: and his words are embodied in the Decretals [Dist. xlvii]: "It is no less a crime to take from him that has, than to refuse to succor the needy when you can and are well off." Therefore just as <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> consists in taking another's thing, so does it consist in keeping it back.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a man may take by stealth from another, even that which is his own, for instance a thing that he has deposited with another, or that has been taken away from him <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>. Therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> that it should consist in taking another's thing secretly.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. x): "'Fur' [<a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a>] is derived from 'furvus' and so from 'fuscus' [dark], because he takes advantage of the night."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Three things combine together to constitute <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>. The first belongs to <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> as being contrary to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which gives to each one that which is his, so that it belongs to <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> to take possession of what is another's. The second thing belongs to <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> as distinct from those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are committed against the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, such as <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> and <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, and in this respect it belongs to <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> to be about a thing possessed: for if a man takes what is another's not as a possession but as a part (for instance, if he amputates a limb), or as a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> connected with him (for instance, if he carry off his daughter or his wife), it is not strictly speaking a case of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>. The third difference is that which completes the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>, and consists in a thing being taken secretly: and in this respect it belongs properly to <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> that it consists in "taking another's thing secretly."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Secrecy is sometimes a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as when a man employs secrecy in order to commit a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for instance in <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> and guile. On this way it does not diminish <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but constitutes a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and thus it is in <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>. On another way secrecy is merely a circumstance of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and thus it diminishes <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, both because it is a sign of shame, and because it removes <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> To keep back what is due to another, inflicts the same kind of injury as taking a thing <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>: wherefore an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> detention is included in an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> taking.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Nothing prevents that which belongs to one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> simply, from belonging to another in some respect: thus a deposit belongs simply to the depositor, but with regard to its custody it is the depositary's, and the thing stolen is the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a>'s, not simply, but as regards its custody.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether theft and robbery are sins of different species?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> and robbery are not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. For <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> and robbery differ as "secret" and "manifest": because <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> is taking something secretly, while robbery is to take something violently and openly. Now in the other kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, the secret and the manifest do not differ specifically. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> and robbery are not different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, moral actions take their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the end, as stated above (I-II, 01, 3; 18, 6). Now <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> and robbery are directed to the same end, viz. the possession of another's property. Therefore they do not differ specifically.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as a thing is taken by force for the sake of possession, so is a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> taken by force for pleasure: wherefore <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. x) that "he who commits a rape is called a corrupter, and the victim of the rape is said to be corrupted." Now it is a case of rape whether the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> be carried off publicly or secretly. Therefore the thing appropriated is said to be taken by force, whether it be done secretly or publicly. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> and robbery do not differ.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. v, 2) distinguishes <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> from robbery, and states that <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> is done in secret, but that robbery is done openly.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Theft and robbery are <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> contrary to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, in as much as one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does another an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>. Now "no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> suffers an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> willingly," as stated in Ethic. v, 9. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> and robbery derive their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, through the taking being involuntary on the part of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> from whom something is taken. Now the involuntary is twofold, namely, through <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, as stated in Ethic. iii, 1. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> aspect of robbery differs from that of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>: and consequently they differ specifically.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In the other kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not derived from something involuntary, as in the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> opposed to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: and so where there is a different kind of involuntary, there is a different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The remote end of robbery and <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> is the same. But this is not enough for identity of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, because there is a difference of proximate ends, since the robber wishes to take a thing by his own power, but the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a>, by cunning.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The robbery of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> cannot be secret on the part of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who is taken: wherefore even if it be secret as regards the others from whom she is taken, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of robbery remains on the part of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to whom <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> is done.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether theft is always a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> is not always a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is commanded by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since it is written (<a href="../bible/sir015.htm#verse21">Sirach 15:21</a>): "He hath commanded no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to do wickedly." Yet we find that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> commanded <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>, for it is written (<a href="../bible/exo012.htm#verse35">Exodus 12:35-36</a>): "And the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> did as the Lord had commanded <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> had commanded']. . . and they stripped the Egyptians." Therefore <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> is not always a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if a man finds a thing that is not his and takes it, he seems to commit a <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>, for he takes another's property. Yet this seems lawful according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> equity, as the jurists hold. [See loc. cit. in Reply.] Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> is not always a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, he that takes what is his own does not seem to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because he does not act against <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, since he does not destroy its equality. Yet a man commits a <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> even if he secretly take his own property that is detained by or in the safe-keeping of another. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> is not always a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse15">Exodus 20:15</a>): "Thou shalt not steal."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> If anyone consider what is meant by <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>, he will find that it is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> on two counts. First, because of its opposition to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which gives to each one what is his, so that for this reason <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> is contrary to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, through being a taking of what belongs to another. Secondly, because of the guile or <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> committed by the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a>, by laying hands on another's property secretly and cunningly. Wherefore it is evident that every <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is no <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> for a man to take another's property either secretly or openly by order of a judge who has commanded him to do so, because it becomes his due by the very fact that it is adjudicated to him by the sentence of the court. Hence still less was it a <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> for the Israelites to take away the spoils of the Egyptians at the command of the Lord, Who ordered this to be done on account of the ill-treatment accorded to them by the Egyptians without any <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: wherefore it is written significantly (<a href="../bible/wis010.htm#verse19">Wisdom 10:19</a>): "The just took the spoils of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> With regard to treasure-trove a distinction must be made. For some there are that were never in anyone's possession, for instance precious stones and jewels, found on the seashore, and such the finder is allowed to keep [Dig. I, viii, De divis. rerum: Inst. II, i, De rerum divis.]. The same applies to treasure hidden underground long since and belonging to no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, except that according to <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> the finder is bound to give half to the owner of the land, if the treasure trove be in the land of another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> [Inst. II, i, 39: Cod. X, xv, De Thesauris]. Hence in the parable of the Gospel (<a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse44">Matthew 13:44</a>) it is said of the finder of the treasure hidden in a field that he bought the field, as though he purposed thus to acquire the right of possessing the whole treasure. On the other Land the treasure-trove may be nearly in someone's possession: and then if anyone take it with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, not of keeping it but of returning it to the owner who does not look upon such things as unappropriated, he is not guilty of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>. On like manner if the thing found appears to be unappropriated, and if the finder <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> it to be so, although he keep it, he does not commit a <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> [Inst. II, i, 47]. In any other case the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> is committed [Dig. XLI, i, De acquirend, rerum dominio, 9: Inst. II, i, 48]: wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> (Serm. clxxviii; De Verb. Apost.): "If thou hast found a thing and not returned it, thou hast stolen it" (Dig. xiv, 5, can. Si quid invenisti).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> He who by stealth takes his own property which is deposited with another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> burdens the depositary, who is bound either to restitution, or to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> himself innocent. Hence he is clearly guilty of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and is bound to ease the depositary of his burden. On the other hand he who, by stealth, takes his own property, if this be <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> detained by another, he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> indeed; yet not because he burdens the retainer, and so he is not bound to restitution or compensation: but he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against general <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> by disregarding the order of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and usurping judgment concerning his own property. Hence he must make satisfaction to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and endeavor to allay whatever <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> he may have given his neighbor by acting this way.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether theft is a mortal sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/pro006.htm#verse30">Proverbs 6:30</a>): "The fault is not so great when a man hath stolen." But every mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a great fault. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> deserves to be punished with death. But in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> is punished not by death but by indemnity, according to <a href="../bible/exo022.htm#verse1">Exodus 22:1</a>, "If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> steal an ox or a sheep . . . he shall restore five oxen for one ox, and four sheep for one sheep." Therefore <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> can be committed in small even as in great things. But it seems unreasonable for a man to be punished with <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> death for the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> of a small thing such as a needle or a quill. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is condemned by the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">Divine judgment</a> save for a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Yet a man is condemned for <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>, according to <a href="../bible/zec005.htm#verse3">Zechariah 5:3</a>, "This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the earth; for every <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a> shall be judged as is there written." Therefore <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above, (<a href="../summa/3059.htm#article4">Question 59, Article 4</a> and <a href="../summa/2072.htm#article5">Prima Secundae Partis, Question 72, Article 5</a>), a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is one that is contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> as the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> consists principally in the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and secondarily in the love of our neighbor, which is shown in our wishing and doing him well. But <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> is a means of doing harm to our neighbor in his belongings; and if men were to rob one another <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> society would be undone. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>, as being opposed to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The statement that <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> is not a great fault is in view of two cases. First, when a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is led to thieve through <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. This <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> diminishes or entirely removes <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as we shall show further on (<a href="../summa/3066.htm#article7">Question 66, Article 7</a>). Hence the text continues: "For he stealeth to fill his hungry <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>." Secondly, <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> is stated not to be a great fault in comparison with the guilt of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, which is punished with death. Hence the text goes on to say of the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a> that "if he be taken, he shall restore sevenfold . . . but he that is an adulterer . . . shall destroy his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The punishments of this life are medicinal rather than retributive. For retribution is reserved to the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">Divine judgment</a> which is pronounced against sinners "according to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>" (Rom. ii, 2). Wherefore, according to the judgment of the present life the death punishment is inflicted, not for every mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but only for such as inflict an irreparable harm, or again for such as contain some horrible deformity. Hence according to the present judgment the pain of death is not inflicted for <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> which does not inflict an irreparable harm, except when it is aggravated by some grave circumstance, as in the case of <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> which is the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> of a sacred thing, of peculation, which is <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> of common property, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (<em>Tract.</em> 1, <em>super Joan.</em>), and of kidnaping which is stealing a man, for which the pain of death is inflicted (<a href="../bible/exo021.htm#verse16">Exodus 21:16</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason</a> accounts as nothing that which is little: so that a man does not consider himself injured in very little matters: and the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who takes such things can presume that this is not against the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the owner. And if a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> take such like very little things, he may be proportionately excused from mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Yet if his <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is to rob and injure his neighbor, there may be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> even in these very little things, even as there may be through consent in a mere thought.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether it is lawful to steal through stress of need?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem unlawful to steal through stress of need. For penance is not imposed except on one who has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>. Now it is stated (Extra, De furtis, Cap. Si quis): "If anyone, through stress of hunger or nakedness, steal food, clothing or beast, he shall do penance for three weeks." Therefore it is not lawful to steal through stress of need.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 6) that "there are some actions whose very name implies <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>," and among these he reckons <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>. Now that which is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> in itself may not be done for a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> end. Therefore a man cannot lawfully steal in order to remedy a need.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a man should love his neighbor as himself. Now, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Contra Mendac. vii), it is unlawful to steal in order to succor one's neighbor by giving him an <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. Therefore neither is it lawful to steal in order to remedy one's own needs.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> In cases of need all things are common property, so that there would seem to be no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in taking another's property, for need has made it common.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Things which are of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> right cannot derogate from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> right or Divine right. Now according to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order established by Divine Providence, inferior things are ordained for the purpose of succoring <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> needs by their means. Wherefore the division and appropriation of things which are based on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, do not preclude the fact that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> needs have to be remedied by means of these very things. Hence whatever certain people have in superabundance is due, by <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, to the purpose of succoring the poor. For this reason <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> [Loc. cit., 2, Objection 3] says, and his words are embodied in the Decretals (Dist. xlvii, can. Sicut ii): "It is the hungry <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> bread that you withhold, the naked <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> cloak that you store away, the money that you bury in the earth is the price of the poor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> ransom and freedom."

<p>Since, however, there are many who are in need, while it is impossible for all to be succored by means of the same thing, each one is entrusted with the stewardship of his own things, so that out of them he may come to the aid of those who are in need. Nevertheless, if the need be so manifest and urgent, that it is evident that the present need must be remedied by whatever means be at hand (for instance when a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is in some imminent danger, and there is no other possible remedy), then it is lawful for a man to succor his own need by means of another's property, by taking it either openly or secretly: nor is this properly speaking <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> or robbery.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This decretal considers cases where there is no urgent need.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>, properly speaking, to take secretly and use another's property in a case of extreme need: because that which he takes for the support of his life becomes his own property by reason of that need.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In a case of a like need a man may also take secretly another's property in order to succor his neighbor in need.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether robbery may be committed without sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that robbery may be committed without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For spoils are taken by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, and this seems to belong to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of robbery, according to what has been said (4). Now it is lawful to take spoils from the enemy; for <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Patriarch. 4 [De <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> i, 3): "When the conqueror has taken possession of the spoils, military discipline demands that all should be reserved for the sovereign," in order, to wit, that he may distribute them. Therefore in certain cases robbery is lawful.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is lawful to take from a man what is not his. Now the things which unbelievers have are not theirs, for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. ad Vincent. Donat. xciii.): "You <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> call things your own, for you do not possess them <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>, and according to the laws of earthly kings you are commanded to forfeit them." Therefore it seems that one may lawfully rob unbelievers.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, earthly princes violently extort many things from their subjects: and this seems to savor of robbery. Now it would seem a grievous <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to say that they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in acting thus, for in that case nearly every prince would be damned. Therefore in some cases robbery is lawful.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Whatever is taken lawfully may be offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in sacrifice and oblation. Now this cannot be done with the proceeds of robbery, according to <a href="../bible/isa061.htm#verse8">Isaiah 61:8</a>, "I am the Lord that love judgment, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> robbery in a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>." Therefore it is not lawful to take anything by robbery.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Robbery implies a certain <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and coercion employed in taking <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> from a man that which is his. Now in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> society no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can exercise coercion except through public authority: and, consequently, if a private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> not having public authority takes another's property by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, he acts unlawfully and commits a robbery, as burglars do. As regards princes, the public power is entrusted to them that they may be the guardians of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: hence it is unlawful for them to use <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> or coercion, save within the bounds of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>--either by fighting against the enemy, or against the citizens, by punishing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>-doers: and whatever is taken by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of this kind is not the spoils of robbery, since it is not contrary to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. On the other hand to take other people's property violently and against <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, in the exercise of public authority, is to act unlawfully and to be guilty of robbery; and whoever does so is bound to restitution.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A distinction must be made in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of spoils. For if they who take spoils from the enemy, are waging a just <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, such things as they seize in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> become their own property. This is no robbery, so that they are not bound to restitution. Nevertheless even they who are engaged in a just <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> may <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in taking spoils through cupidity arising from an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, if, to wit, they fight chiefly not for <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> but for spoil. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Verb. Dom. xix; Serm. lxxxii) that "it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to fight for booty." If, however, those who take the spoil, are waging an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, they are guilty of robbery, and are bound to restitution.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Unbelievers possess their goods <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> in so far as they are ordered by the laws of earthly princes to forfeit those goods. Hence these may be taken violently from them, not by private but by public authority.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is no robbery if princes exact from their subjects that which is due to them for the safe-guarding of the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, even if they use <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> in so doing: but if they extort something unduly by means of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, it is robbery even as burglary is. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei iv, 4): "If <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> be disregarded, what is a king but a mighty robber? since what is a robber but a little king?" And it is written (<a href="../bible/eze022.htm#verse27">Ezekiel 22:27</a>): "Her princes in the midst of her, are like wolves ravening the prey." Wherefore they are bound to restitution, just as robbers are, and by so much do they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> more grievously than robbers, as their actions are fraught with greater and more universal danger to public <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> whose wardens they are.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether theft is a more grievous sin than robbery?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than robbery. For <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> adds <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> and guile to the taking of another's property: and these things are not found in robbery. Now <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> and guile are <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> in themselves, as stated above (55, 4,5). Therefore <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than robbery.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, shame is fear about a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, as stated in Ethic. iv, 9. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are more ashamed of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> than of robbery. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> is more <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> than robbery.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the more <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> injures the more grievous it would seem to be. Now the great and the lowly may be injured by <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>: whereas only the weak can be injured by robbery, since it is possible to use <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> towards them. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> seems to be more grievous than the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of robbery.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> According to the laws robbery is more severely punished than <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Robbery and <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> are <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, as stated above (A4,6), on account of the involuntariness on the part of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> from whom something is taken: yet so that in <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> the involuntariness is due to <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, whereas in robbery it is due to <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. Now a thing is more involuntary through <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> than through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, because <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> is more directly opposed to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> than <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. Therefore robbery is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>. There is also another reason, since robbery not only inflicts a loss on a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in his things, but also conduces to the ignominy and injury of his <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and this is of graver import than <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> or guile which belong to <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>.

<p>Hence the Reply to the First Objection is evident.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Men who adhere to sensible things think more of external strength which is evidenced in robbery, than of internal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which is forfeit through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: wherefore they are less ashamed of robbery than of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although more <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> may be injured by <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> than by robbery, yet more grievous injuries may be inflicted by robbery than by <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>: for which reason also robbery is more odious.
