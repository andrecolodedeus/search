<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether inseparableness of the wife is of natural law?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that inseparableness of the wife is not of <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> is the same for all. But no <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> save <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> has forbidden the <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorcing</a> of a wife. Therefore inseparableness of a wife is not of <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are not of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>. But the indissolubility of marriage is one of the marriage goods. Therefore it is not of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the union of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in marriage is chiefly directed to the begetting, rearing, and instruction of the offspring. But all things are complete by a certain time. Therefore after that time it is lawful to put away a wife without prejudice to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the offspring is the principal end of marriage. But the indissolubility of marriage is opposed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the offspring, because, according to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, a certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot beget offspring of a certain <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and yet he might beget of another, even though she may have had intercourse with another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore the indissolubility of marriage is against rather than according to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Those things which were assigned to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> when it was well established in its beginning belong especially to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now the indissolubility of marriage is one of these things according to <a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse4">Matthew 19:4-6</a>. Therefore it is of <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>.

<p>Further, it is of <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should not oppose himself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Yet <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would, in a way, oppose himself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> if he were to sunder "what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath joined together." Since then the indissolubility of marriage is gathered from this passage (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse6">Matthew 19:6</a>) it would seem that it is of <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> By the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> marriage is directed to the rearing of the offspring, not merely for a time, but throughout its whole life. Hence it is of <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> that parents should lay up for their children, and that children should be their parents' heirs (<a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse14">2 Corinthians 12:14</a>). Therefore, since the offspring is the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of husband and wife, the dictate of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> requires the latter to live together for ever inseparably: and so the indissolubility of marriage is of <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> alone brought <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> "to perfection" [Cf. <a href="../bible/heb007.htm#verse19">Hebrews 7:19</a> by bringing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> back to the state of the newness of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Wherefore neither Mosaic nor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laws could remove all that was contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, for this was reserved exclusively to "the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the spirit of life" [Cf. <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse2">Romans 8:2</a>].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Indissolubility belongs to marriage in so far as the latter is a sign of the perpetual union of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and in so far as it fulfills an office of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that is directed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the offspring, as stated above. But since <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> is more directly incompatible with the signification of the sacrament than with the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the offspring, with which it is incompatible consequently, as stated above (65, 2, ad 5), the indissolubility of marriage is implied in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the sacrament rather than in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the offspring, although it may be connected with both. And in so far as it is connected with the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the offspring, it is of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, but not as connected with the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p>The Reply to the Third Objection may be gathered from what has been said.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Marriage is chiefly directed to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in respect of its principal end, which is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the offspring; although in respect of its secondary end it is directed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the contracting party, in so far as it is by its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> a remedy for <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. Hence marriage laws consider what is expedient for all rather than what may be suitable for one. Therefore although the indissolubility of marriage hinder the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the offspring with regard to some <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, it is proportionate with the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the offspring absolutely speaking: and for this reason the argument does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether it may have been lawful by dispensation to put away a wife?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that it could not be lawful by dispensation to put away a wife. For in marriage anything that is opposed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the offspring is against the first precepts of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, which admit of no dispensation. Now such is the putting away of a wife, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore, etc.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubine</a> differs from a wife especially in the fact that she is not inseparably united. But by no dispensation could a man have a <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubine</a>. Therefore by no dispensation could he put his wife away.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, men are as fit to receive a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> now as of old. But now a man cannot receive a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> to <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> his wife. Neither, therefore, could he in olden times.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> carnally <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Agar with the disposition of a husband towards his wife, as stated above (65, 5, ad 2,3). Now by Divine command he sent her away, and yet <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> not. Therefore it could be lawful by dispensation for a man to put away his wife.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In the commandments, especially those which in some way are of <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> is like a change in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> course of things: and this course is subject to a twofold change. First, by some <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> whereby another <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is hindered from following its course: it is thus in all things that happen by chance less frequently in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. In this way, however, there is no variation in the course of those <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things which happen always, but only in the course of those which happen frequently. Secondly, by a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> altogether <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, as in the case of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>: and in this way there can be a variation in the course of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, not only in the course which is appointed for the majority of cases, but also in the course which is appointed for all cases, as instanced by the sun standing still at the time of <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Josue</a>, and by its turning back at the time of <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a>, and by the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> eclipse at the time of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> [<a href="../bible/jos010.htm#verse14">Joshua 10:14</a>; <a href="../bible/2ki020.htm#verse10">2 Kings 20:10</a>; <a href="../bible/isa038.htm#verse8">Isaiah 38:8</a>; <a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse15">Matthew 27:15</a>]. In like manner the reason for a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from a precept of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is sometimes found in the lower <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, and in this way a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> may bear upon the secondary precepts of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, but not on the first precepts because these are always existent as it were, as stated above (Question 65, Article 1) in reference to the plurality of wives and so forth. But sometimes this reason is found in the higher <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, and then a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> may be given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> even from the first precepts of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, for the sake of signifying or showing some Divine <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, as instanced in the dispensation vouchsafed to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> in the slaying of his innocent son. Such dispensations, however, are not granted to all generally, but to certain <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, as also happens in regard to <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. Accordingly, if the indissolubility of marriage is contained among the first precepts of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, it could only be a matter of dispensation in this second way; but, if it be one of the second precepts of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, it could be a matter of dispensation even in the first way. Now it would seem to belong rather to the secondary precepts of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>. For the indissolubility of marriage is not directed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the offspring, which is the principal end of marriage, except in so far as parents have to provide for their children for their whole life, by due preparation of those things that are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in life. Now this preparation does not pertain to the first <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, in respect of which all things are common. And therefore it would seem that to put away one's wife is not contrary to the first <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and consequently that it is contrary not to the first but to the second precepts of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>. Therefore, seemingly, it can be a matter of dispensation even in the first way.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the offspring, in so far as it belongs to the first intention of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, includes procreation, nourishment, and instruction, until the offspring comes to perfect age. But that provision be made for the children by bequeathing to them the inheritance or other goods belongs seemingly to the second intention of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> To have a <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubine</a> is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the offspring, in respect of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature's</a> first <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> in that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, namely the rearing and instruction of the child, for which purpose it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the parents remain together permanently; which is not the case with a <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubine</a>, since she is taken for a time. Hence the comparison fails. But in respect of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature's</a> second <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, even the having of a <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubine</a> may be a matter of dispensation as evidenced by <a href="../bible/hos001.htm">Hosea 1</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although indissolubility belongs to the second <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of marriage as fulfilling an office of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it belongs to its first <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Hence, from the moment it was made a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as long as it remains such it cannot be a matter of dispensation, except perhaps by the second kind of dispensation.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether it was lawful to divorce a wife under the Mosaic law?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it was lawful to <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> a wife under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic law</a>. For one way of giving consent is to refrain from prohibiting when one can prohibit. It is also unlawful to consent to what is unlawful. Since then the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic law</a> did not forbid the putting away of a wife and did no wrong by not forbidding it, for "the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> . . . is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse12">Romans 7:12</a>), it would seem that <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> was at one time lawful.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> spoke inspired by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, according to <a href="../bible/2pe001.htm#verse21">2 Peter 1:21</a>. Now it is written (<a href="../bible/mal002.htm#verse16">Malachi 2:16</a>): "When thou shalt <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> her, put her away." Since then that which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> inspires is not unlawful, it would seem that it was not always unlawful to <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> a wife.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> [Hom. xxxii in the Opus Imperfectum <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>] says that even as the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> permitted second marriages, so <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> allowed the bill of <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a>. But second marriages are not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. Therefore neither was it <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic law</a> to <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> a wife.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse8">Matthew 19:8</a>) that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> granted the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> the bill of <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> by reason of the hardness of their heart. But their hardness of heart did not excuse them from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Neither therefore did the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> about the bill of <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says [Hom. xxxii in the Opus Imperfectum <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>] that "<a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, by granting the bill of <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a>, did not indicate the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but deprived their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of its guilt, for while the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> acted as though they were keeping the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> seemed to be no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> on this point there are two opinions. For some say that under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> those who put away their wives, after giving them a bill of <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a>, were not excused from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, although they were excused from the punishment which they should have suffered according to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>: and that for this reason <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> is stated to have permitted the bill of <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a>. Accordingly they reckon four kinds of permission: one by absence of precept, so that when a greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is not prescribed, a lesser <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is said to be permitted: thus the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> by not prescribing <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, permitted marriage (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm">1 Corinthians 7</a>). The second is by absence of prohibition: thus venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are said to be permitted because they are not forbidden. The third is by absence of prevention, and thus all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are said to be permitted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in so far as He does not prevent them whereas He can. The fourth is by omission of punishment, and in this way the bill of <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> was permitted in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, not indeed for the sake of obtaining a greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as was the dispensation to have several wives, but for the sake of preventing a greater <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, namely wife-<a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> to which the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> were prone on account of the corruption of their irascible <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Even so they were allowed to lend money for usury to strangers, on account of corruption in their <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, lest they should exact usury of their brethren; and again on account of the corruption of suspicion in the reason they were allowed the sacrifice of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">jealousy</a>, lest mere suspicion should corrupt their judgment. But because the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, though it did not confer <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, was given that it might indicate <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are agreed in saying, others are of opinion that if it had been a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for a man to put away his wife, this ought to have been indicated to him, at least by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> or the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>: "Show My people their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> doings" (<a href="../bible/isa058.htm#verse1">Isaiah 58:1</a>): else they would seem to have been neglected, if those things which are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and which they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not were never made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to them: and this cannot be admitted, because the righteousness of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> observed at the time of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> would <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>. For this reason they say that although to put away one's wife is wrong in itself, it nevertheless became lawful by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> permitting it, and they confirm this by the authority of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>, who says [Hom. xxxii in the Opus Imperfectum <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>] that "the Lawgiver by permitting <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> removed the guilt from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." Although this opinion has some probability the former is more generally held: wherefore we must reply to the arguments on both sides [Cf. I-II, 105, 4, ad 8; I-II, 108, 3, ad 2; Contra Gentes iii, cap. 123.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> He who can forbid, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not by omitting to forbid if he has no hope of correcting, but <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> by forbidding to furnish the occasion of a greater <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Thus it happened to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: wherefore acting on Divine authority he did not forbid the bill of <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, inspired by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, said that a wife ought to be put away, not as though this were a command of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, but as being permitted lest greater <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> should be perpetrated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This likeness of permission must not be applied to every detail, but only to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> which was the same in both cases, since both permissions were granted in order to avoid some form of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Although their hardness of heart excused them not from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the permission given on account of that hardness excused them. For certain things are forbidden those who are healthy in body, which are not forbidden the sick, and yet the sick <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not by availing themselves of the permission granted to them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> may be omitted in two ways. First, in order to obtain a greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and then the omission of that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> becomes <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> by being directed to a greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; thus <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> rightly omitted to have only one wife, on account of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the offspring. In another way a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is omitted in order to avoid a greater <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and then if this is done with the authority of one who can grant a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>, the omission of that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, and yet it does not also become <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>. In this way the indissolubility of marriage was suspended in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in order to avoid a greater <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, namely wife-<a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says that "he removed the guilt from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." For though <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> remained inordinate, for which reason it is called a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it did not incur the debt of punishment, either temporal or <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, in so far as it was done by Divine permission: and thus its guilt was taken away from it. And therefore he says again [Hom. xxxii in the Opus Imperfectum <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>] that "<a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> was permitted, an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> indeed, yet lawful." Those who hold the first opinion understand by this only that <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> incurred the debt of temporal punishment.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether it was lawful for a divorced wife to have another husband?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it was lawful for a <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a> wife to have another husband. For in <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> the husband did a greater wrong by <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorcing</a> his wife than the wife by being <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a>. But the husband could, without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, marry another wife. Therefore the wife could without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, marry another husband.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, speaking about <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">bigamy</a>, says (De Bono Conjug. xv, xviii) that "when it was the manner it was no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." Now at the time of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> it was the custom for a wife after <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> to marry another husband: "When she is departed and marrieth another husband," etc. Therefore the wife <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> not by marrying another husband.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> showed that the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> is superabundant in comparison with the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm">Matthew 5</a>). Now He said that it belongs to the superabundant <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> that the <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a> wife marry not another husband (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse32">Matthew 5:32</a>). Therefore it was lawful in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong><strong>On the contrary,</strong> are the words of <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse32">Matthew 5:32</a>, "He that shall marry her that is put away committeth <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> was never permitted in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. Therefore it was not lawful for the <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a> wife to have another husband.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/deu024.htm#verse3">Deuteronomy 24:3</a>) that a <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who marries another husband "is defiled, and is become abominable before the Lord." Therefore she <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> by marrying another husband.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to the first above mentioned opinion (3), she <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> by marrying another husband after being <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a>, because her first marriage still held <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. For "the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> . . . whilst her husband liveth, is bound to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of her husband" (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse2">Romans 7:2</a>): and she could not have several husbands at one time. But according to the second opinion, just as it was lawful by virtue of the Divine dispensation for a husband to <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> his wife, so could the wife marry another husband, because the indissolubility of marriage was removed by reason of the divine dispensation: and as long as that indissolubility remains the saying of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> holds.

<p>Accordingly to reply to the arguments on either side:

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It was lawful for a husband to have several wives at one time by virtue of the divine dispensation: wherefore having put one away he could marry another even though the former marriage were not dissolved. But it was never lawful for a wife to have several husbands. Wherefore the comparison fails.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In this saying of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> manner [mos] does not signify custom but <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> manners; in the same sense a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is said to have manners [morigeratus] because he has <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> manners; and "moral" <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> takes its name from the same source.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> shows the superabundance of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> over the Old in respect of the counsels, not only as regards those things which the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> permitted, but also as regards those things which were forbidden in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, and yet were thought by many to be permitted on account of the precepts being incorrectly explained--for instance that of the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> towards our enemies. and so is it in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The saying of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> refers to the time of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, when the aforesaid permission was recalled. In the same way we are to understand the statement of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> [Hom. xii in the Opus Imperfectum <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>], who says that "a man who <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorces</a> his wife according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is guilty of four crimes: for in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sight he is a murderer," in so far as he has the purpose of killing his wife unless he <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> her; "and because he <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorces</a> her without her having committed fornication," in which case alone the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the Gospel allows a man to put away his wife; "and again, because he makes her an adulteress, and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whom she marries an adulterer."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> observes here: "She is defiled and abominable, namely in the judgment of him who first put her away as being defiled," and consequently it does not follow that she is defiled absolutely speaking; or she is said to be defiled just as a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who had touched a dead or <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprous</a> body was said to be <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> with the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>, not of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but of a certain legal <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a>. Wherefore a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> could not marry a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> or a <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether a husband could lawfully take back the wife he had divorced?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a husband could lawfully take back the wife he had <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a>. For it is lawful to undo what was ill done. But for the husband to <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> his wife was ill done. Therefore it was lawful for him to undo it, by taking back his wife.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it has always been lawful to be indulgent to the sinner, because this is a moral precept, which obtains in every <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Now the husband by taking back the wife he had <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a> was indulgent to one who had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>. Therefore this also was lawful.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the reason given (<a href="../bible/deu024.htm#verse4">Deuteronomy 24:4</a>) for its being unlawful to take back a <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a> wife was "because she is defiled." But the <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a> wife is not defiled except by marrying another husband. Therefore at least it was lawful to take back a <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a> wife before she <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> again.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/deu024.htm#verse4">Deuteronomy 24:4</a>) that "the former husband cannot take her again," etc.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> concerning the bill of <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> two things were permitted, namely for the husband to put away the wife, and for the <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a> wife to take another husband; and two things were commanded, namely that the bill of <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> should be written, and secondly that the husband who <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a> his wife could not take her back. According to those who hold the first opinion (3) this was done in punishment of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> again, and that it was by this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that she was defiled: but according to the others it was done that a husband might not be too ready to <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> his wife if he could nowise take her back afterwards.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In order to prevent the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> committed by a man in <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorcing</a> his wife, it was ordered that the husband could not take back his <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a> wife, as stated above: and for this reason it was ordered by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It was always lawful to be indulgent to the sinner as regards the unkindly feelings of the heart, but not as regards the punishment appointed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There are two opinions on this point. For some say that it was lawful for a <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a> wife to be reconciled to her husband, unless she were joined in marriage to another husband. For then, on account of the <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> to which she had <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> yielded, it was assigned to her in punishment that she should not return to her former husband. Since, however, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> makes no distinction in its prohibition, others say that from the moment that she was put away she could not be taken back, even before marrying again, because the defilement must be understood not in reference to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but as explained above (4, ad 3).

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the reason for divorce was hatred for the wife?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the reason for <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> was <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> for the wife. For it is written (<a href="../bible/mal002.htm#verse16">Malachi 2:16</a>): "When thou shalt <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> her put her away." Therefore, etc.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/deu024.htm#verse1">Deuteronomy 24:1</a>): "If . . . she find not favor in his eyes, for some <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>," etc. Therefore the same conclusion follows as before.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Barrenness and fornication are more opposed to marriage than <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. Therefore they ought to have been reasons for <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> rather than <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> may be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>. Therefore, if <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is a sufficient reason, a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> could be <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a> on account of her <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which is absurd.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, "If a man marry a wife and afterwards <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> her, and seek occasions to put her away"* alleging that she was not a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> when he <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> her, should he fail to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> this, he shall be beaten, and shall be condemned in a hundred sicles of silver, and he shall be unable to put her away all the days of his life (<a href="../bible/deu022.htm#verse13">Deuteronomy 22:13-19</a>). [The rest of the passage is apparently quoted from <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>.] Therefore <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is not a sufficient reason for <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is the general opinion of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men that the reason for permission being given to <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> a wife was the avoidance of wife-murder. Now the proximate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> is <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>: wherefore the proximate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> was <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. But <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> proceeds, like love, from a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Wherefore we must assign to <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> certain remote <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> which were a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in his <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 14): "In the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> there were many <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> for <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorcing</a> a wife: <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> admitted none but fornication: and He commands other grievances to be borne for conjugal fidelity and <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>." Such <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> are imperfections either of body, as sickness or some notable deformity, or in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as fornication or the like which amounts to moral depravity. Some, however, restrict these <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> within narrower limits, saying with sufficient probability that it was not lawful to <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> a wife except for some <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> subsequent to the marriage; and that not even then could it be done for any such <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but only for such as could hinder the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the offspring, whether in body as barrenness, or <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> and the like, or in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, for instance if she were a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> which her children through continual contact with her would imitate. There is however a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/deu024.htm#verse1">Deuteronomy 24:1</a>, "If . . . she find not favor in his eyes," which would seem to restrict them yet more, namely to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, by saying that there "<a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>" denotes <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: but "<a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>" in the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> refers not only to the <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> but also to the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the body. Accordingly we grant the first two objections.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Barrenness and other like things are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, and so they are remote <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> No one is hateful on account of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> as such, because <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of love. Wherefore the argument does not hold.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The husband was punished in that case by being unable to put away his wife for ever, just as in the case when he had corrupted a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">maid</a> (<a href="../bible/deu022.htm#verse28">Deuteronomy 22:28-30</a>).

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the causes of divorce had to be written in the bill?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> had to be written in the bill: because the husband was <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> from the punishment of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> by the written bill of <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a>. But this would seem altogether <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, unless sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> were alleged for a <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a>. Therefore it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for them to be written in the bill.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, seemingly this document was of no use except to show the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> for <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a>. Therefore, if they were not written down, the bill was delivered for no purpose.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> says that it was so in the text (Sent. iv, D, 33).

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> for <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> were either sufficient or not. If they were sufficient, the wife was debarred from a <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">second marriage</a>, though this was allowed her by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. If they were insufficient, the <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, and therefore could not be effected. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> for <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> were by no means particularized in the bill.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> for <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> were not particularized in the bill, but were indicated in a general way, so as to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a>. According to <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> (Antiq. iv, 6) this was in order that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, having the written bill of <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a>, might take another husband, else she would not have been <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. Wherefore according to him it was written in this wise: "I promise never to have thee with me again." But according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Contra Faust. xix, 26) the bill was put into writing in order to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a delay, and that the husband might be dissuaded by the counsel of the <a href="../cathen/11122a.htm">notaries</a> to refrain from his purpose of <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a>.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.
