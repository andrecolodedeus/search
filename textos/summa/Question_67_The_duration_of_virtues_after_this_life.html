<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the moral virtues remain after this life?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> doe not remain after this life. For in the future state of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> men will be like <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse30">Matthew 22:30</a>. But it is absurd to put moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> ["Whatever relates to moral action is petty, and unworthy of the gods" (Ethic. x, 8)], as stated in Ethic. x, 8. Therefore neither in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will there be moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> after this life.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> perfect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the active life. But the active life does not remain after this life: for <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. iv, 18): "The works of the active life pass away from the body." Therefore moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> do not remain after this life.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, which are moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, are in the irrational parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. iii, 10). Now the irrational parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are corrupted, when the body is corrupted: since they are acts of bodily organs. Therefore it seems that the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> do not remain after this life.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/wis001.htm#verse15">Wisdom 1:15</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is perpetual and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiv, 9), Cicero held that the cardinal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> do not remain after this life; and that, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiv, 9), "in the other life men are made <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> by the mere <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, than which nothing is better or more lovable, that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, to wit, which <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> all others." Afterwards he concludes that these four <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> remain in the future life, but after a different manner.

<p>In order to make this evident, we must note that in these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> there is a formal element, and a quasi-material element. The material element in these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> is a certain inclination of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> part to the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and operations according to a certain mode: and since this mode is fixed by reason, the formal element is precisely this order of reason.

<p>Accordingly we must say that these moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> do not remain in the future life, as regards their material element. For in the future life there will be no <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a> and pleasures in matters of food and sex; nor fear and daring about dangers of death; nor distributions and commutations of things employed in this present life. But, as regards the formal element, they will remain most perfect, after this life, in the Blessed, in as much as each one's reason will have most perfect rectitude in regard to things concerning him in respect of that state of life: and his <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power will be moved entirely according to the order of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, in things pertaining to that same state. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiv, 9) that "<a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> will be there without any danger of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, without the anxiety of bearing with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, without the rebellion of the desires: so that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> will neither prefer nor equal any <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> will adhere to Him most steadfastly; and <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> will delight in Him Who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> no imperfection." As to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, it is yet more evident what will be its act in that life, viz. "to be subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>": because even in this life subjection to a superior is part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> is speaking there of these moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as to their material element; thus he speaks of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as regards "commutations and distributions"; of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, as to "matters of terror and danger"; of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, in respect of "lewd desires."

<p>The same applies to the Second Objection. For those things that concern the active life, belong to the material element of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There is a twofold state after this life; one before the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, during which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will be separate from the body; the other, after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> will be reunited to their bodies. In this state of <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, the irrational powers will be in the bodily organs, just as they now are. Hence it will be possible for <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> to be in the irascible, and <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> part, in so far as each power will be perfectly disposed to obey the reason. But in the state preceding the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, the irrational parts will not be in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> actually, but only radically in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, as stated in the I, 77, 8. Wherefore neither will these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> be actually, but only in their root, i.e. in the reason and will, wherein are certain nurseries of these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as stated above (Question 63, Article 1). Justice, however, will remain because it is in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Hence of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> it is specially said that it is "perpetual and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>"; both by reason of its subject, since the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is incorruptible; and because its act will not change, as stated.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the intellectual virtues remain after this life?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> do not remain after this life. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse8">1 Corinthians 13:8-9</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> shall be destroyed," and he states the reason to be because "we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in part." Now just as the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of science is in part, i.e. imperfect; so also is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the other <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as long as this life lasts. Therefore all the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> will cease after this life.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Categor. vi) that since science is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, it is a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> difficult to remove: for it is not easily lost, except by reason of some great change or sickness. But no bodily change is so great as that of death. Therefore science and the other <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> do not remain after death.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> perfect the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> so that it may perform its proper act well. Now there seems to be no act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> after this life, since "the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> understands nothing without a phantasm" (De Anima iii, text. 30); and, after this life, the phantasms do not remain, since their only subject is an organ of the body. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> do not remain after this life.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of what is universal and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> is more constant than that of particular and contingent things. Now the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of contingent particulars remains in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> after this life; for instance, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of what one has done or suffered, according to <a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse25">Luke 16:25</a>: "Son, remember that thou didst receive <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things in thy life-time, and likewise <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things." Much more, therefore, does the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of universal and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> things remain, which belong to science and the other <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated in the I, 79, 6 some have held that the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> do not remain in the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> except when it actually understands; and that so long as actual consideration ceases, the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are not preserved save in the sensitive powers which are acts of bodily organs, viz. in the powers of <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> and <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>. Now these powers cease when the body is corrupted: and consequently, according to this opinion, neither science nor any other <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> will remain after this life when once the body is corrupted.

<p>But this opinion is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, who states (De Anima iii, text. 8) that "the possible <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is in act when it is identified with each thing as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it; and yet, even then, it is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to consider it actually." It is also contrary to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, because intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are contained by the "possible" <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> immovably, according to the mode of their container. Hence the "possible" <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is called "the abode of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>" (De Anima iii) because it preserves the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p>And yet the phantasms, by turning to which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> understands in this life, by applying the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> to them as stated in the I, 84, 7; I, 85, 1, ad 5, cease as soon as the body is corrupted. Hence, so far as the phantasms are concerned, which are the quasi-material element in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, these latter cease when the body is destroyed: but as regards the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, which are in the "possible" <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> remain. Now the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are the quasi-formal element of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Therefore these remain after this life, as regards their formal element, just as we have stated concerning the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> (1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The saying of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> is to be understood as referring to the material element in science, and to the mode of understanding; because, to it, neither do the phantasms remain, when the body is destroyed; nor will science be applied by turning to the phantasms.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Sickness destroys the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of science as to its material element, viz. the phantasms, but not as to the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, which are in the "possible" <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated in the I, 89, 1 the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has a mode of understanding, other than by turning to the phantasms. Consequently science remains, yet not as to the same mode of operation; as we have stated concerning the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> (1).

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether faith remains after this life?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> remains after this life. Because <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is more excellent than science. Now science remains after this life, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> remains also.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse11">1 Corinthians 3:11</a>): "Other foundation no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can lay, but that which is laid; which is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>," i.e. <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. Now if the foundation is removed, that which is built upon it remains no more. Therefore, if <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> remains not after this life, no other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> remains.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> differ as perfect from imperfect. Now imperfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is compatible with perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: thus in an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> there can be "evening" and "morning" <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> [Cf. I, 58, 6]; and a man can have science through a demonstrative syllogism, together with opinion through a probable syllogism, about one same conclusion. Therefore after this life <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> also is compatible with the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse6">2 Corinthians 5:6-7</a>): "While we are in the body, we are absent from the Lord: for we walk by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and not by sight." But those who are in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> are not absent from the Lord, but present to Him. Therefore after this life <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> does not remain in the life of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Opposition is of itself the proper <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of one thing being excluded from another, in so far, to wit, as wherever two things are opposite to one another, we find opposition of affirmation and negation. Now in some things we find opposition in respect of contrary forms; thus in colors we find white and black. In others we find opposition in respect of perfection and imperfection: wherefore in alterations, more and less are considered to be contraries, as when a thing from being less hot is made more hot (Phys. v, text. 19). And since perfect and imperfect are opposite to one another, it is impossible for perfection and imperfection to affect the same thing at the same time.

<p>Now we must take note that sometimes imperfection belongs to a thing's very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and belongs to its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>: even as lack of reason belongs to the very specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a horse and an ox. And since a thing, so long as it remains the same identically, cannot pass from one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> to another, it follows that if such an imperfection be removed, the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of that thing is changed: even as it would no longer be an ox or a horse, were it to be rational. Sometimes, however, the imperfection does not belong to the specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> by reason of something else; even as sometimes lack of reason is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to a man, because he is asleep, or because he is drunk, or for some like reason; and it is evident, that if such an imperfection be removed, the thing remains substantially.

<p>Now it is clear that imperfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> belongs to the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: for it is included in its definition; <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> being defined as "the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of things to be hoped for, the evidence of things that appear not" (<a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse1">Hebrews 11:1</a>). Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. xl in Joan.): "Where is <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? Believing without seeing." But it is an imperfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that is of things unapparent or unseen. Consequently imperfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> belongs to the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: therefore it is clear that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> cannot be perfect and remain identically the same.

<p>But we must also consider whether it is compatible with perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: for there is nothing to prevent some kind of imperfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from being sometimes with perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Accordingly we must observe that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> can be imperfect in three ways: first, on the part of the knowable object; secondly, on the part of the medium; thirdly, on the part of the subject. The difference of perfect and imperfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> on the part of the knowable object is seen in the "morning" and "evening" <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>: for the "morning" <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is about things according to the being which they have in the Word, while the "evening" <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is about things according as they have being in their own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, which being is imperfect in comparison with the First Being. On the part of the medium, perfect and imperfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> are exemplified in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of a conclusion through a demonstrative medium, and through a probable medium. On the part of the subject the difference of perfect and imperfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> applies to opinion, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and science. For it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to opinion that we assent to one of two opposite assertions with fear of the other, so that our adhesion is not firm: to science it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to have firm adhesion with <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> vision, for science possesses <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> which results from the understanding of principles: while <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> holds a middle place, for it surpasses opinion in so far as its adhesion is firm, but falls short of science in so far as it lacks vision.

<p>Now it is evident that a thing cannot be perfect and imperfect in the same respect; yet the things which differ as perfect and imperfect can be together in the same respect in one and the same other thing. Accordingly, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which is perfect on the part of the object is quite incompatible with imperfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> about the same object; but they are compatible with one another in respect of the same medium or the same subject: for nothing hinders a man from having at one and the same time, through one and the same medium, perfect and imperfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> about two things, one perfect, the other imperfect, e.g. about health and sickness, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. In like manner <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that is perfect on the part of the medium is incompatible with imperfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> through one and the same medium: but nothing hinders them being about the same subject or in the same subject: for one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the same conclusions through a probable and through a demonstrative medium. Again, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that is perfect on the part of the subject is incompatible with imperfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the same subject. Now <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, of its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, contains an imperfection on the part of the subject, viz. that the believer sees not what he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a>: whereas bliss, of its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, implies perfection on the part of the subject, viz. that the Blessed see that which makes them <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, as stated above (Question 3, Article 8). Hence it is manifest that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and bliss are incompatible in one and the same subject.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> is more excellent than science, on the part of the object, because its object is the First Truth. Yet science has a more perfect mode of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> its object, which is not incompatible with vision which is the perfection of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, as the mode of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is incompatible.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> is the foundation in as much as it is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: consequently when this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is perfected, the foundation will be perfected also.

<p>The Reply to the Third Objection is clear from what has been said.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether hope remains after death, in the state of glory?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that hope remains after death, in the state of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Because hope perfects the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> in a more excellent manner than the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. But the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> remain after this life, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> clearly states (De Trin. xiv, 9). Much more then does hope remain.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, fear is opposed to hope. But fear remains after this life: in the Blessed, filial fear, which abides for ever--in the lost, the fear of punishment. Therefore, in a like manner, hope can remain.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as hope is of future <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, so is desire. Now in the Blessed there is desire for future <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; both for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the body, which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the Blessed desire, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> declares (Gen. ad lit. xii, 35); and for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, according to <a href="../bible/sir024.htm#verse29">Sirach 24:29</a>: "They that eat me, shall yet hunger, and they that drink me, shall yet thirst," and <a href="../bible/1pe001.htm#verse12">1 Peter 1:12</a>: "On Whom the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> desire to look." Therefore it seems that there can be hope in the Blessed after this life is past.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse24">Romans 8:24</a>): "What a man seeth, why doth he hope for?" But the Blessed see that which is the object of hope, viz. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore they do not hope.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), that which, in its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, implies imperfection of its subject, is incompatible with the opposite perfection in that subject. Thus it is evident that movement of its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> implies imperfection of its subject, since it is "the act of that which is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> as such" (Phys. iii): so that as soon as this <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> is brought into act, the movement ceases; for a thing does not continue to become white, when once it is made white. Now hope denotes a movement towards that which is not possessed, as is clear from what we have said above about the passion of hope (40, A1,2). Therefore when we possess that which we hope for, viz. the enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it will no longer be possible to have hope.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Hope surpasses the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> as to its object, which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But the acts of the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not incompatible with the perfection of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, as the act of hope is; except perhaps, as regards their <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, in respect of which they do not remain. For moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> perfects the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, not only in respect of what is not yet possessed, but also as regards something which is in our actual possession.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Fear is twofold, servile and filial, as we shall state further on (II-II, 19, 2). Servile fear regards punishment, and will be impossible in the life of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, since there will no longer be possibility of being punished. Filial fear has two acts: one is an act of reverence to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and with regard to this act, it remains: the other is an act of fear lest we be separated from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and as regards this act, it does not remain. Because separation from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: and no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will be feared there, according to <a href="../bible/pro001.htm#verse33">Proverbs 1:33</a>: "He . . . shall enjoy abundance without fear of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>." Now fear is opposed to hope by opposition of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as stated above (23, 2; 40, 1), and therefore the fear which will remain in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is not opposed to hope. In the lost there can be fear of punishment, rather than hope of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the Blessed. Because in the lost there will be a succession of punishments, so that the notion of something future remains there, which is the object of fear: but the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> has no succession, by reason of its being a kind of participation of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, wherein there is neither past nor future, but only the present. And yet, properly speaking, neither in the lost is there fear. For, as stated above (Question 42, Article 2), fear is never without some hope of escape: and the lost have no such hope. Consequently neither will there be fear in them; except speaking in a general way, in so far as any expectation of future <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is called fear.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, there can be no desire in the Blessed, in so far as desire looks for something future, for the reason already given (ad 2). Yet hunger and thirst are said to be in them because they never weary, and for the same reason desire is said to be in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. With regard to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the body, there can be desire in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, but not hope, properly speaking; neither as a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, for thus its object is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; nor in its general signification. Because the object of hope is something difficult, as stated above (Question 40, Article 1): while a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> whose unerring <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> we already possess, is not compared to us as something difficult. Hence he that has money is not, properly speaking, said to hope for what he can buy at once. In like manner those who have the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are not, properly speaking, said to hope for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the body, but only to desire it.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether anything of faith or hope remains in glory?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that something of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope remains in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. For when that which is proper to a thing is removed, there remains what is common; thus it is stated in De Causis that "if you take away rational, there remains living, and when you remove living, there remains being." Now in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> there is something that it has in common with beatitude, viz. <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: and there is something proper to it, viz. darkness, for <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in a dark manner. Therefore, the darkness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> removed, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> still remains.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> light of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, according to <a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse17">Ephesians 1:17-18</a>: "The eyes of your heart enlightened . . . in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>"; yet this light is imperfect in comparison with the light of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, of which it is written (<a href="../bible/psa035.htm#verse10">Psalm 35:10</a>): "In Thy light we shall see light." Now an imperfect light remains when a perfect light supervenes: for a candle is not extinguished when the sun's rays appear. Therefore it seems that the light of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself remains with the light of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> does not cease through the withdrawal of its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: for a man may retain the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of liberality, though he have lost his money: yet he cannot exercise the act. Now the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the First Truth as unseen. Therefore when this ceases through being seen, the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> can still remain.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> is a simple <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. Now a simple thing is either withdrawn entirely, or remains entirely. Since therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> does not remain entirely, but is taken away as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), it seems that it is withdrawn entirely.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some have held that hope is taken away entirely: but that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is taken away in part, viz. as to its obscurity, and remains in part, viz. as to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of its <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. And if this be understood to mean that it remains the same, not identically but generically, it is absolutely <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; since <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is of the same genus, viz. <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a>. On the other hand, hope is not of the same genus as heavenly bliss: because it is compared to the enjoyment of bliss, as movement is to rest in the term of movement.

<p>But if it be understood to mean that in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> remains identically the same, this is absolutely impossible. Because when you remove a specific difference, the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the genus does not remain identically the same: thus if you remove the difference constituting whiteness, the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of color does not remain identically the same, as though the identical color were at one time whiteness, and, at another, blackness. The reason is that genus is not related to difference as <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to form, so that the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the genus remains identically the same, when the difference is removed, as the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> remains identically the same, when the form is changed: for genus and difference are not the parts of a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, else they would not be predicated of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But even as the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> denotes the whole, i.e. the compound of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> in material things, so does the difference, and likewise the genus; the genus denotes the whole by signifying that which is material; the difference, by signifying that which is formal; the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, by signifying both. Thus, in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the sensitive <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is as <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and animal is predicated of that which has a sensitive <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, rational of that which has an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of that which has both. So that the one same whole is denoted by these three, but not under the same aspect.

<p>It is therefore evident that, since the signification of the difference is confined to the genus if the difference be removed, the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the genus cannot remain the same: for the same animal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> does not remain, if another kind of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> constitute the animal. Hence it is impossible for the identical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which was previously obscure, to become clear vision. It is therefore evident that, in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, nothing remains of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, either identically or specifically the same, but only generically.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> If "rational" be withdrawn, the remaining "living" thing is the same, not identically, but generically, as stated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The imperfection of candlelight is not opposed to the perfection of sunlight, since they do not regard the same subject: whereas the imperfection of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the perfection of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> are opposed to one another and regard the same subject. Consequently they are incompatible with one another, just as light and darkness in the air.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> He that loses his money does not therefore lose the possibility of having money, and therefore it is reasonable for the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of liberality to remain. But in the state of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> not only is the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which is the unseen, removed actually, but even its possibility, by reason of the unchangeableness of heavenly bliss: and so such a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> would remain to no purpose.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether charity remains after this life, in glory?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> does not remain after this life, in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Because according to <a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse10">1 Corinthians 13:10</a>, "when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part," i.e. that which is imperfect, "shall be done away." Now the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of the wayfarer is imperfect. Therefore it will be done away when the perfection of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is attained.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> and acts are differentiated by their objects. But the object of love is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> apprehended. Since therefore the apprehension of the present life differs from the apprehension of the life to come, it seems that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not the same in both cases.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, things of the same kind can advance from imperfection to perfection by continuous increase. But the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of the wayfarer can never attain to equality with the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, however much it be increased. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of the wayfarer does not remain in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse8">1 Corinthians 13:8</a>): "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> never falleth away."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), when the imperfection of a thing does not belong to its specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, there is nothing to hinder the identical thing passing from imperfection to perfection, even as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is perfected by growth, and whiteness by intensity. Now <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is love, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of which does not include imperfection, since it may relate to an object either possessed or not possessed, either seen or not seen. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not done away by the perfection of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, but remains identically the same.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The imperfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to it; because imperfection is not included in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of love. Now although that which is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to a thing be withdrawn, the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> remains. Hence the imperfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> being done away, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> itself is not done away.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The object of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> itself; if it were, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of the wayfarer would not be the same as the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: its object is the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, which remains the same, viz. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The reason why <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of the wayfarer cannot attain to the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, is a difference on the part of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: for vision is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of love, as stated in Ethic. ix, 5: and the more perfectly we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the more perfectly we love Him.
