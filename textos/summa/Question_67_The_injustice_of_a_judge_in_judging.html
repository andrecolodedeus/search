<h1>Question 67. The injustice of a judge, in judging</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3067.htm#article1"> Can a man justly judge one who is not his subject?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3067.htm#article2"> Is it lawful for a judge, on account of the evidence, to deliver judgment in opposition to the truth which is known to him?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3067.htm#article3"> Can a judge justly sentence a man who is not accused?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3067.htm#article4"> Can he justly remit the punishment?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether a man can justly judge one who is not subject to his jurisdiction?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a man can <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> judge one who is not subject to his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. For it is stated (<a href="../bible/dan013.htm">Daniel 13</a>) that <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">Daniel</a> sentenced the ancients who were convicted of bearing <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> witness. But these ancients were not subject to <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">Daniel</a>; indeed they were judges of the people. Therefore a man may lawfully judge one that is not subject to his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> subject, indeed He was "King of kings and Lord of lords" (<a href="../bible/rev019.htm#verse16">Apocalypse 19:16</a>). Yet He submitted to the judgment of a man. Therefore it seems that a man may lawfully judge one that is not subject to his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> [Cap. Licet ratione, de Foro Comp.] a man is tried in this or that court according to his kind of offense. Now sometimes the defendant is not the subject of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whose business it is to judge in that particular place, for instance when the defendant belongs to another diocese or is exempt. Therefore it seems that a man may judge one that is not his subject.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> [Regist. xi, epist. 64 in commenting on <a href="../bible/deu023.htm#verse25">Deuteronomy 23:25</a>, "If thou go into thy friend's corn," etc. says: "Thou mayest not put the sickle of judgment to the corn that is entrusted to another."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A judge's sentence is like a particular <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> regarding some particular fact. Wherefore just as a general <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> should have coercive power, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. x, 9), so too the sentence of a judge should have coercive power, whereby either party is compelled to comply with the judge's sentence; else the judgment would be of no effect. Now coercive power is not exercised in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, save by those who hold public authority: and those who have this authority are accounted the superiors of those over whom they preside whether by ordinary or by delegated authority. Hence it is evident that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can judge others than his subjects and this in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> either of delegated or of ordinary authority.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In judging those ancients <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">Daniel</a> exercised an authority delegated to him by Divine instinct. This is indicated where it is said (<a href="../bible/dan013.htm#verse45">Daniel 13:45</a>) that "the Lord raised up the . . . spirit of a young boy."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs a man may submit of his own accord to the judgment of others although these be not his superiors, an example of which is when parties agree to a settlement by arbitrators. Wherefore it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the arbitrator should be upheld by a penalty, since the arbitrators through not exercising authority in the case, have not of themselves full power of coercion. Accordingly in this way did <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> of his own accord submit to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> judgment: and thus too did <a href="../cathen/09159a.htm">Pope Leo [Leo IV]</a> submit to the judgment of the emperor [Can. Nos si incompetenter, caus. ii, qu. 7.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the defendant's diocese becomes the latter's superior as regards the fault committed, even though he be exempt: unless perchance the defendant offend in a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> exempt from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> authority, for instance in administering the property of an exempt monastery. But if an exempt <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> commits a <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>, or a <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> or the like, he may be <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> condemned by the ordinary.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether it is lawful for a judge to pronounce judgment against the truth that he knows, on account of evidence to the contrary?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem unlawful for a judge to pronounce judgment against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, on account of evidence to the contrary. For it is written (<a href="../bible/deu017.htm#verse9">Deuteronomy 17:9</a>): "Thou shalt come to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the Levitical race, and to the judge that shall be at that time; and thou shalt ask of them, and they shall show thee the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the judgment." Now sometimes certain things are alleged against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as when something is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by means of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>. Therefore it is unlawful for a judge to pronounce judgment according to what is alleged and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in pronouncing judgment a man should conform to the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">Divine judgment</a>, since "it is the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/deu001.htm#verse17">Deuteronomy 1:17</a>). Now "the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is according to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse2">Romans 2:2</a>), and it was foretold of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse3">Isaiah 11:3-4</a>): "He shall not judge according to the sight of the eyes, nor reprove according to the hearing of the ears. But He shall judge the poor with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and shall reprove with equity for the meek of the earth." Therefore the judge ought not to pronounce judgment according to the evidence before him if it be contrary to what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> himself.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the reason why evidence is required in a court of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, is that the judge may have a faithful record of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, wherefore in matters of common <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> there is no need of judicial procedure, according to <a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse24">1 Timothy 5:24</a>, "Some men's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are manifest, going before to judgment." Consequently, if the judge by his personal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is aware of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, he should pay no heed to the evidence, but should pronounce sentence according to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the word "<a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>" denotes application of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to a matter of action as stated in I, 79, 13. Now it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to act contrary to one's <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Therefore a judge <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> if he pronounces sentence according to the evidence but against his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [<a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a>, Super Ps. 118, serm. 20 says in his commentary on the Psalter: "A <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> judge does nothing according to his private opinion but pronounces sentence according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and the right." Now this is to pronounce judgment according to what is alleged and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in court. Therefore a judge ought to pronounce judgment in accordance with these things, and not according to his private opinion.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1; 60, 2,6) it is the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of a judge to pronounce judgment in as much as he exercises public authority, wherefore his judgment should be based on information acquired by him, not from his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as a private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, but from what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> as a public <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Now the latter <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> comes to him both in general and in particular --in general through the public laws, whether Divine or <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, and he should admit no evidence that conflicts therewith--in some particular <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, through documents and <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>, and other legal means of information, which in pronouncing his sentence, he ought to follow rather than the information he has acquired as a private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. And yet this same information may be of use to him, so that he can more rigorously sift the evidence brought forward, and discover its weak points. If, however, he is unable to reject that evidence juridically, he must, as stated above, follow it in pronouncing sentence.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The reason why, in the passage quoted, it is stated that the judges should first of all be asked their reasons, is to make it clear that the judges ought to judge the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in accordance with the evidence.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> To judge belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in virtue of His own power: wherefore His judgment is based on the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which He Himself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, and not on <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> imparted by others: the same is to be said of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: whereas other judges do not judge in virtue of their own power, so that there is no comparison.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> refers to the case where something is well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> not to the judge alone, but both to him and to others, so that the guilty party can by no means deny his guilt (as in the case of <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> criminals), and is convicted at once from the evidence of the fact. If, on the other hand, it be well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the judge, but not to others, or to others, but not to the judge, then it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the judge to sift the evidence.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> In matters touching his own <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, a man must form his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> from his own <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but in matters concerning the public authority, he must form his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> attainable in the public judicial procedure.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether a judge may condemn a man who is not accused?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a judge may pass sentence on a man who is not accused. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is derived from Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> judges the sinner even though there be no accuser. Therefore it seems that a man may pass sentence of condemnation on a man even though there be no accuser.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, an accuser is required in judicial procedure in order that he may relate the crime to the judge. Now sometimes the crime may come to the judge's <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> otherwise than by accusation; for instance, by <a href="../cathen/04733b.htm">denunciation</a>, or by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> report, or through the judge himself being an eye-witness. Therefore a judge may condemn a man without there being an accuser.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are related in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>, as models of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> conduct. Now <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">Daniel</a> was at the same time the accuser and the judge of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> ancients (<a href="../bible/dan013.htm">Daniel 13</a>). Therefore it is not contrary to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> for a man to condemn anyone as judge while being at the same time his accuser.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> in his commentary on <a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse2">1 Corinthians 5:2</a>, expounding the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle's</a> sentence on the fornicator, says that "a judge should not condemn without an accuser, since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> did not banish <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a>, who was a <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a>, yet was not accused."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A judge is an interpreter of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Wherefore, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. v, 4), "men have recourse to a judge as to one who is the personification of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>." Now, as stated above (Question 58, Article 2), <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is not between a man and himself but between one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and another. Hence a judge must needs judge between two parties, which is the case when one is the prosecutor, and the other the defendant. Therefore in criminal cases the judge cannot sentence a man unless the latter has an accuser, according to <a href="../bible/act025.htm#verse16">Acts 25:16</a>: "It is not the custom of the Romans to condemn any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, before that he who is accused have his accusers present, and have liberty to make his answer, to clear himself of the crimes" of which he is accused.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in judging <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, takes the sinner's <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> as his accuser, according to <a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse15">Romans 2:15</a>, "Their thoughts between themselves accusing, or also defending one another"; or again, He takes the evidence of the fact as regards the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> itself, according to <a href="../bible/gen004.htm#verse10">Genesis 4:10</a>, "The voice of thy brother's blood crieth to Me from the earth."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Public disgrace takes the place of an accuser. Hence a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/gen004.htm#verse10">Genesis 4:10</a>, "The voice of thy brother's blood," etc. says: "There is no need of an accuser when the crime committed is <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a>." On a case of <a href="../cathen/04733b.htm">denunciation</a>, as stated above (Question 33, Article 07), the amendment, not the punishment, of the sinner is intended: wherefore when a man is denounced for a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, nothing is done against him, but for him, so that no accuser is required. The punishment that is inflicted is on account of his rebellion against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and since this rebellion is manifest, it stands instead of an accuser. The fact that the judge himself was an eye-witness, does not authorize him to proceed to pass sentence, except according to the order of judicial procedure.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in judging <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, proceeds from His own <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, whereas <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Hence a man cannot be accuser, witness and judge at the same time, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is. <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">Daniel</a> was at once accuser and judge, because he was the executor of the sentence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by whose instinct he was moved, as stated above (1, ad 1).

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the judge can lawfully remit the punishment?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the judge can lawfully remit the punishment. For it is written (<a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse13">James 2:13</a>): "Judgment without mercy" shall be done "to him that hath not done mercy." Now no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is punished for not doing what he cannot do lawfully. Therefore any judge can lawfully do mercy by remitting the punishment.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> judgment should imitate the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">Divine judgment</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> remits the punishment to sinners, because He desires not the death of the sinner, according to <a href="../bible/eze018.htm#verse23">Ezekiel 18:23</a>. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> judge also may lawfully remit the punishment to one who repents.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is lawful for anyone to do what is profitable to some one and harmful to none. Now the remission of his punishment profits the guilty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and harms nobody. Therefore the judge can lawfully loose a guilty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from his punishment.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/deu013.htm#verse8">Deuteronomy 13:8-9</a>) concerning anyone who would persuade a man to serve strange gods: "Neither let thy eye spare him to pity and conceal him, but thou shalt presently put him to death": and of the murderer it is written (<a href="../bible/deu019.htm#verse12">Deuteronomy 19:12-13</a>): "He shall die. Thou shalt not pity him."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As may be gathered from what has been said (A2,3), with regard to the question in point, two things may be observed in connection with a judge. One is that he has to judge between accuser and defendant, while the other is that he pronounces the judicial sentence, in virtue of his power, not as a private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> but as a public <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Accordingly on two counts a judge is hindered from loosing a guilty <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> from his punishment. First on the part of the accuser, whose right it sometimes is that the guilty party should be punished--for instance on account of some injury committed against the accuser--because it is not in the power of a judge to remit such punishment, since every judge is bound to give each <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> his right. Secondly, he finds a hindrance on the part of the commonwealth, whose power he exercises, and to whose <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> it belongs that evil-doers should be punished.

<p>Nevertheless in this respect there is a difference between judges of lower degree and the supreme judge, i.e. the sovereign, to whom the entire public authority is entrusted. For the inferior judge has no power to exempt a guilty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from punishment against the laws imposed on him by his superior. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> in <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse11">John 19:11</a>, "Thou shouldst not have any power against Me," says (Tract. cxvi in Joan.): "The power which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> was such that he was under the power of Caesar, so that he was by no means free to acquit the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> accused." On the other hand the sovereign who has full authority in the commonwealth, can lawfully remit the punishment to a guilty <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, provided the injured party consent to the remission, and that this do not seem detrimental to the public <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> There is a place for the judge's mercy in matters that are left to the judge's discretion, because in like matters a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is slow to punish as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. v, 10). But in matters that are determined in accordance with Divine or <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laws, it is not left to him to show mercy.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has supreme power of judging, and it concerns Him whatever is done sinfully against anyone. Therefore He is free to remit the punishment, especially since punishment is due to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> chiefly because it is done against Him. He does not, however, remit the punishment, except in so far as it becomes His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, which is the source of all laws.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If the judge were to remit punishment inordinately, he would inflict an injury on the community, for whose <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> it behooves ill-deeds to be punished, in order that. men may avoid <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Hence the text, after appointing the punishment of the seducer, adds (<a href="../bible/deu013.htm#verse11">Deuteronomy 13:11</a>): "That all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> hearing may fear, and may do no more anything like this." He would also inflict harm on the injured <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; who is compensated by having his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> restored in the punishment of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who has injured him.
