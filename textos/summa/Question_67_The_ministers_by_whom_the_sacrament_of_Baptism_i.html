<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether it is part of a deacon's duty to baptize?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that it is part of a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon's</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>. Because the duties of preaching and of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> were enjoined by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> at the same time, according to <a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew 28:19</a>: "Going . . . teach ye all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> them," etc. But it is part of a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon's</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to preach the gospel. Therefore it seems that it is also part of a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon's</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Eccl. Hier. v) to "cleanse" is part of the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon's</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. But cleansing from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is effected specially by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, according to <a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse26">Ephesians 5:26</a>: "Cleansing it by the laver of water in the word of life." Therefore it seems that it belongs to a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is told of Blessed Laurence, who was a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, that he <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> many. Therefore it seems that it belongs to <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06406a.htm">Pope Gelasius I</a> says (the passage is to be found in the Decrees, dist. 93): "We order the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> to keep within their own province"; and further on: "Without <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> they must not dare to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, except in cases of extreme urgency, when the aforesaid are a long way off."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Just as the properties and duties of the heavenly orders are gathered from their names, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. vi), so can we gather, from the names of the ecclesiastical orders, what belongs to each order. Now "<a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>" are so called from being "ministers"; because, to wit, it is not in the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon's</a> province to be the chief and official celebrant in conferring a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but to minister to others, his elders, in the sacramental dispensations. And so it does not belong to a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> to confer the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> officially as it were; but to assist and serve his elders in the bestowal of this and other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Epist. ad Ludifred.): "It is a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon's</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to assist and serve the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, in all the rites of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, viz. those of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, of the Chrism, of the Paten and Chalice."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon's</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to read the Gospel in church, and to preach it as one catechizing; hence <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. v) that a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon's</a> office involves power over the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> among whom he includes the catechumens. But to teach, i.e. to expound the Gospel, is the proper office of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, whose action is "to perfect," as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> teaches (Eccl. Hier. v); and "to perfect" is the same as "to teach." Consequently, it does not follow that the office of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. ii), <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> has a power not only of "cleansing" but also of "enlightening." Consequently, it is outside the province of the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> whose <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> it is to cleanse only: viz. either by driving away the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>, or by preparing them for the reception of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Because <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> sacrament, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> are allowed to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> in cases of urgency when their elders are not at hand; as appears from the authority of Gelasius quoted above. And it was thus that Blessed Laurence, being but a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether to baptize is part of the priestly office, or proper to that of bishops?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> is not part of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> office, but proper to that of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Because, as stated above (1, Objection 1), the duties of teaching and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> are enjoined in the same precept (<a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew 28:19</a>). But to teach, which is "to perfect," belongs to the office of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> declares (Eccl. Hier. v, vi). Therefore to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> also belongs to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> office.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> a man is admitted to the body of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people: and to do this seems consistent with no other than the princely office. Now the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> hold the position of princes in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> observes on <a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse1">Luke 10:1</a>: indeed, they even take the place of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, of whom it is written (<a href="../bible/psa044.htm#verse17">Psalm 44:17</a>): "Thou shalt make them princes over all the earth." Therefore it seems that to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> belongs exclusively to the office of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Epist. ad Ludifred.) that "it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> churches, to anoint altars, to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> [conficere] the <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>; he it is that confers the ecclesiastical orders, and blesses the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> is greater than all these. Therefore much more reason is there why to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> should belong exclusively to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> office.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (De Officiis. ii): "It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> was entrusted to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> alone."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Priests are <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> for the purpose of celebrating the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Body, as stated above (Question 65, Article 3). Now that is the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">ecclesiastical unity</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse17">1 Corinthians 10:17</a>): "We, being many, are one bread, one body, all that partake of one bread and one <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>." Moreover, by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> a man becomes a participator in <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">ecclesiastical unity</a>, wherefore also he receives the right to approach <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> Table. Consequently, just as it belongs to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, which is the principal purpose of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, so it is the proper office of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>: since it seems to belong to one and the same, to produce the whole and to dispose the part in the whole.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> enjoined on the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, whose place is taken by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, both duties, namely, of teaching and of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>, but in different ways. Because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> committed to them the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of teaching, that they might exercise it themselves as being the most important <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of all: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> themselves said (<a href="../bible/act006.htm#verse2">Acts 6:2</a>): "It is not reason that we should leave the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and serve tables." On the other hand, He entrusted the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> with the office of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>, to be exercised vicariously; wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse17">1 Corinthians 1:17</a>): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> sent me not to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, but to preach the Gospel." And the reason for this was that the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> and wisdom of the minister have no bearing on the baptismal effect, as they have in teaching, as may be seen from what we have stated above (64, 1, ad 2; 5,9). A <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this is found also in the fact that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> Himself did not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, but His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, as John relates (<a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse2">4:2</a>). Nor does it follow from this that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>; since what a lower power can do, that can also a higher power. Wherefore also the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse14">1 Corinthians 1:14-16</a>) that he had <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> some.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In every commonwealth minor affairs are entrusted to lower officials, while greater affairs are restricted to higher officials; according to <a href="../bible/exo018.htm#verse22">Exodus 18:22</a>: "When any great <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> soever shall fall out, let them refer it to thee, and let them judge the lesser matters only." Consequently it belongs to the lower officials of the state to decide matters concerning the lower orders; while to the highest it belongs to set in order those matters that regard the higher orders of the state. Now by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> a man attains only to the lowest rank among the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people: and consequently it belongs to the lesser officials of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, namely, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, who hold the place of the seventy-two <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says in the passage quoted from <a href="../bible/luk010.htm">Luke 10</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (Question 65, Article 3), the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> holds the first place in the order of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>; but in the order of perfection there are other greater <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which are reserved to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether a layman can baptize?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>. Because, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> belongs properly to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> order. But those things which belong to an order cannot be entrusted to one that is not ordained. Therefore it seems that a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, who has no orders, cannot <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is a greater thing to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, than to perform the other sacramental rites of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, such as to catechize, to exorcize, and to <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> the baptismal water. But these things cannot be done by laymen, but only by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Therefore it seems that much less can laymen <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> sacrament, so is Penance. But a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> in the tribunal of Penance. Neither, therefore, can he <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06406a.htm">Pope Gelasius I</a> and <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> say that "it is often permissible for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> laymen to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, in cases of urgent <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is due to the mercy of Him "Who will have all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to be saved" (<a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse4">1 Timothy 2:4</a>) that in those things which are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can easily find the remedy. Now the most <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> among all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> regeneration unto <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life: since for children there is no substitute, while adults cannot otherwise than by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> receive a full remission both of guilt and of its punishment. Consequently, lest <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should have to go without so <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> a remedy, it was ordained, both that the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> should be something common that is easily obtainable by all, i.e. water; and that the minister of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> should be anyone, even not in orders, lest from lack of being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should suffer loss of his <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> To <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> belongs to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> order by reason of a certain appropriateness and <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a>; but this is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Consequently, if a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> were to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> even outside a case of urgency; he would <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, yet he would confer the sacrament; nor would the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> thus <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> have to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> These sacramental rites of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> belong to the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> of, and are not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. And therefore they neither should nor can be done by a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, but only by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, whose office it is to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> solemnly.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (65, 3,4), Penance is not so <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>; since <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> can supply the defect of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> which does not free from the whole punishment, nor again is it given to children. Therefore the comparison with <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> does not stand, because its effect cannot be supplied by anything else.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether a woman can baptize?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>. For we read in the acts of the Council of Carthage (iv): "However learned and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> may be, she must not presume to teach men in the church, or to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>." But in no case is a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> allowed to teach in church, according to <a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse35">1 Corinthians 14:35</a>: "It is a shame for a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to speak in the church." Therefore it seems that neither is a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in any circumstances permitted to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> belongs to those having authority. wherefore <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> should be conferred by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> having charge of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. But <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are not qualified for this; according to <a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse12">1 Timothy 2:12</a>: "I suffer not a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to teach, nor to use authority over <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but to be subject to him [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'but to be in silence']." Therefore a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> regeneration water seems to hold the place of the mother's womb, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says on <a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse4">John 3:4</a>, "Can" a man "enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born again?" While he who baptizes seems to hold rather the position of father. But this is unfitting for a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Pope Urban II says (Decreta xxx): "In reply to the questions asked by your beatitude, we consider that the following answer should be given: that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is valid when, in cases of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> baptizes a child in the name of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the chief Baptizer, according to <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse33">John 1:33</a>: "He upon Whom thou shalt see the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> descending and remaining upon Him, He it is that baptizeth." For it is written in <a href="../bible/col003.htm">Colossians 3</a> (cf. <a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse28">Galatians 3:28</a>), that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there is neither male nor female. Consequently, just as a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> can <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, as Christ's minister, so can a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.

<p>But since "the head of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," and "the head of . . . <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, is Christ" (<a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse3">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>), a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> should not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> if a man be available for the purpose; just as neither should a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> in the presence of a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>, nor a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> in the presence of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. The last, however, can <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> in the presence of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, because it is part of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> office.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Just as a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is not suffered to teach in public, but is allowed to instruct and admonish privately; so she is not permitted to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> publicly and solemnly, and yet she can <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> in a case of urgency.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is celebrated solemnly and with due form, it should be conferred by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> having charge of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, or by one representing him. But this is not required in cases of urgency, when a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> may <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In carnal generation male and female co-operate according to the power of their proper <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; wherefore the female cannot be the active, but only the passive, principle of generation. But in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> generation they do not act, either of them, by their proper power, but only instrumentally by the power of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Consequently, on the same grounds either <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> can <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> in a case of urgency.

<p>If, however, a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> were to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> without any urgency for so doing. there would be no need of rebaptism: as we have said in regard to laymen (3, ad 1). But the baptizer herself would <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as also those who took part with her therein, either by receiving <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> from her, or by bringing someone to her to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether one that is not baptized can confer the sacrament of Baptism?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that one that is not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> cannot confer the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a>. For "none gives what he has not." But a non-<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> has not the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a>. Therefore he cannot give it.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a man confers the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> inasmuch as he is a minister of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But one that is not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, belongs nowise to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, i.e. neither really nor sacramentally. Therefore he cannot confer the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is more to confer a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> than to receive it. But one that is not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, cannot receive the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Much less, therefore, can he confer any sacrament.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says: "The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a> does not consider it to be the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who baptizes, but that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> confers the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, though he that baptizes be a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a>." But he who is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, is not called a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a>. Therefore he who is not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> can confer the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> left this question without deciding it. For he says (Contra Ep. Parmen. ii): "This is indeed another question, whether even those can <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> who were never <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; nor should anything be rashly asserted hereupon, without the authority of a sacred council such as suffices for so great a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>." But afterwards it was decided by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that the unbaptized, whether <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> or <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, can confer the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a>, provided they <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> in the form of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Wherefore Pope Nicolas I replies to the questions propounded by the Bulgars: "You say that many in your country have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by someone, whether <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> or <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not. If these were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, they must not be rebaptized." But if the form of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> be not observed, the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> is not conferred. And thus is to be explained what Gregory II [<a href="../cathen/06789a.htm">Gregory III</a>] writes to Bishop Boniface: "Those whom you assert to have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>," namely, with a form not recognized by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, "we command you to rebaptize in the name of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>." And the reason of this is that, just as on the part of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as far as the essentials of the sacrament are concerned, any water will suffice, so, on the part of the minister, any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is competent. Consequently, an unbaptized <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> can <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> in a case of urgency. So that two unbaptized <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> may <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> one another, one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> the other and being afterwards <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by him: and each would receive not only the sacrament but also the reality of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. But if this were done outside a case of urgency, each would <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> grievously, both the baptizer and the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and thus the baptismal effect would be frustrated, although the sacrament itself would not be invalidated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who baptizes offers but his outward ministration; whereas <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> it is Who baptizes inwardly, Who can use all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to whatever purpose He wills. Consequently, the unbaptized can <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>: because, as Pope Nicolas I says, "the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is not theirs," i.e. the baptizers', "but His," i.e. Christ's.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> He who is not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, though he belongs not to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> either in reality or sacramentally, can nevertheless belong to her in <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> and by similarity of action, namely, in so far as he intends to do what the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does, and in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> observes the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> form, and thus acts as the minister of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who did not confine His power to those that are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, as neither did He to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are not so <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. And therefore it is allowable that an unbaptized <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> should <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> rather than that he should receive other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether several can baptize at the same time?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that several can <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> at the same time. For unity is contained in multitude, but not "vice versa." Wherefore it seems that many can do whatever one can but not "vice versa": thus many draw a ship which one could draw. But one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>. Therefore several, too, can <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> one at the same time.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is more difficult for one agent to act on many things, than for many to act at the same time on one. But one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> several at the same time. Much more, therefore, can many <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> one at the same time.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of the greatest <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. Now in certain cases it seems <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for several to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> one at the same time; for instance, suppose a child to be in danger of death, and two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> present, one of whom is dumb, and the other without hands or arms; for then the mutilated <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> would have to pronounce the words, and the dumb <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> would have to perform the act of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>. Therefore it seems that several can <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> one at the same time.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Where there is one agent there is one action. If, therefore, several were to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> one, it seems to follow that there would be several baptisms: and this is contrary to <a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse5">Ephesians 4:5</a>: "one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The Sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> derives its power principally from its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> calls "the word of life" (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse26">Ephesians 5:26</a>). Consequently, if several were to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> one at the same time, we must consider what form they would use. For were they to say: "We <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> thee in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>," some maintain that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> would not be conferred, because the form of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> would not be observed, i.e. "I <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> thee in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." But this reasoning is disproved by the form observed in the Greek Church. For they might say: "The servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, N . . ., is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>," under which form the Greeks receive the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a>: and yet this form differs far more from the form that we use, than does this: "We <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> thee."

<p>The point to be observed, however, is this, that by this form, "We <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> thee," the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> expressed is that several concur in conferring one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>: and this seems contrary to the notion of a minister; for a man does not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> save as a minister of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and as standing in His place; wherefore just as there is one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, so should there be one minister to represent <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says pointedly (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse5">Ephesians 4:5</a>): "one Lord, one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>." Consequently, an <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> which is in opposition to this seems to annul the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a>.

<p>On the other hand, if each were to say: "I <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> thee in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>," each would signify his <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> as though he were conferring <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> independently of the other. This might occur in the case where both were striving to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> someone; and then it is clear that whichever pronounced the words first would confer the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a>; while the other, however great his right to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, if he presume to utter the words, would be liable to be punished as a rebaptizer. If, however, they were to pronounce the words absolutely at the same time, and dipped or sprinkled the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> together, they should be punished for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> in an improper manner, but not for rebaptizing: because each would intend to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> an unbaptized <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and each, so far as he is concerned, would <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>. Nor would they confer several <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>: but the one Christ <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> inwardly would confer one sacrament by means of both together.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument avails in those agents that act by their own power. But men do not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> by their own, but by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> power, Who, since He is one, perfects His work by means of one minister.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In a case of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> one could <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> several at the same time under this form: "I <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> ye": for instance, if they were threatened by a falling house, or by the sword or something of the kind, so as not to allow of the delay involved by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> them singly. Nor would this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a change in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> form, since the plural is nothing but the singular doubled: especially as we find the plural expressed in <a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew 28:19</a>: "Baptizing them," etc. Nor is there parity between the baptizer and the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the baptizer in chief, is one: while many are made one in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (Question 66, Article 1), the integrity of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> consists in the form of words and the use of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Consequently, neither he who only pronounces the words, baptizes, nor he who dips. Where fore if one pronounces the words and the other dips, no form of words can be fitting. For neither could he say: "I <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> thee": since he dips not, and therefore baptizes not. Nor could they say: "We <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> thee": since neither baptizes. For if of two men, one write one part of a book, and the other write the other, it would not be a proper form of speech to say: "We wrote this book," but the figure of synecdoche in which the whole is put for the part.

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for someone to raise the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> from the sacred font. For our <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> and is conformed thereto. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> when <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> was not raised by anyone from the font, but according to <a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse16">Matthew 3:16</a>, "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, forthwith came out of the water." Therefore it seems that neither when others are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> should anyone raise the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> from the sacred font.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> regeneration, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). But in carnal generation nothing else is required but the active principle, i.e. the father, and the passive principle, i.e. the mother. Since, then, in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> he that baptizes takes the place of the father, while the very water of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> takes the place of the mother, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a sermon on the Epiphany (cxxxv); it seems that there is no further need for someone to raise the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> from the sacred font.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, nothing ridiculous should be observed in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But it seems ridiculous that after being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, adults who can stand up of themselves and leave the sacred font, should be held up by another. Therefore there seems no need for anyone, especially in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of adults, to raise the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> from the sacred font.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. ii) that "the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> taking the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> hand him over to his sponsor and guide."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> regeneration, which takes place in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, is in a certain manner likened to carnal generation: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse2">1 Peter 2:2</a>): "As new-born babes, endowed with reason desire milk [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'desire reasonable milk'] without guile." Now, in carnal generation the new-born child needs nourishment and guidance: wherefore, in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> generation also, someone is needed to undertake the office of nurse and tutor by forming and instructing one who is yet a novice in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, concerning things pertaining to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and mode of life, which the clergy have not the leisure to do through being busy with watching over the people generally: because little children and novices need more than ordinary care. Consequently someone is needed to receive the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> from the sacred font as though for the purpose of instructing and guiding them. It is to this that <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> refers (Eccl. Hier. xi) saying: "It occurred to our heavenly guides," i.e. the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostles</a>, "and they decided, that infants should be taken charge of thus: that the parents of the child should hand it over to some instructor versed in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things, who would thenceforth take charge of the child, and be to it a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> father and a guide in the road of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> not that He might be regenerated, but that He might regenerate others: wherefore after His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> He needed no tutor like other children.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In carnal generation nothing is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> besides a father and a mother: yet to ease the latter in her travail, there is need for a midwife; and for the child to be suitably brought up there is need for a nurse and a tutor: while their place is taken in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> by him who raises the child from the sacred font. Consequently this is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, and in a case of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> one alone can <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> with water.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is not on account of bodily weakness that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> is raised from the sacred font by the godparent, but on account of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> weakness, as stated above.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether he who raises anyone from the sacred font is bound to instruct him?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that he who raises anyone from the sacred font is not bound to instruct him. For none but those who are themselves instructed can give instruction. But even the uneducated and ill-instructed are allowed to raise people from the sacred font. Therefore he who raises a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> from the font is not bound to instruct him.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a son is instructed by his father better than by a stranger: for, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. viii), a son receives from his father, "being, food, and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>." If, therefore, godparents are bound to instruct their godchildren, it would be fitting for the carnal father, rather than another, to be the godparent of his own child. And yet this seems to be forbidden, as may be seen in the Decretals (xxx, qu. 1, Cap. Pervenit and Dictum est).

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is better for several to instruct than for one only. If, therefore, godparents are bound to instruct their godchildren, it would be better to have several godparents than only one. Yet this is forbidden in a decree of Pope Leo, who says: "A child should not have more than one godparent, be this a man or a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a sermon for <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> (clxviii): "In the first place I admonish you, both men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, who have raised children in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, that ye stand before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as sureties for those whom you have been seen to raise from the sacred font."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is bound to fulfil those duties which he has undertaken to perform. Now it has been stated above (<a href="#7">Article 7</a>) that godparents take upon themselves the duties of a tutor. Consequently they are bound to watch over their godchildren when there is need for them to do so: for instance when and where children are brought up among unbelievers. But if they are brought up among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, the godparents may well be excused from this responsibility, since it may be presumed that the children will be carefully instructed by their parents. If, however, they perceive in any way that the contrary is the case, they would be bound, as far as they are able, to see to the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> welfare of their godchildren.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Where the danger is imminent, the godparent, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. vii), should be someone "versed in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things." But where the danger is not imminent, by reason of the children being brought up among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, anyone is admitted to this position, because the things pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> rule of life and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> openly by all. Nevertheless an unbaptized <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> cannot be a godparent, as was decreed in the Council of Mainz, although an unbaptized <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>: because the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, wherefore as the godparent is not, as stated above (7, ad 2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> generation is distinct from carnal generation, so is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> education distinct from that of the body; according to <a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse9">Hebrews 12:9</a>: "Moreover we have had fathers of our flesh for instructors, and we reverenced them: shall we not much more obey the Father of Spirits, and live?" Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> father should be distinct from the carnal father, unless <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> demanded otherwise.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Education would be full of confusion if there were more than one head instructor. Wherefore there should be one principal sponsor in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>: but others can be allowed as assistants.
