<h1>Question 68. Illegitimate children</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5068.htm#article1"> Are those born out of true marriage illegitimate?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5068.htm#article2"> Should children suffer any loss through being illegitimate?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5068.htm#article3"> Can they be legitimized?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether children born out of true marriage are illegitimate?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that children born out of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> marriage are legitimate. For he that is born according to <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is called a legitimate son. Now everyone is born according to <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, at least the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which has more force than any other. Therefore every child is to be called legitimate.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is the common saying that a legitimate child is one born of a legitimate marriage, or of a marriage that is deemed legitimate in the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Now it happens sometimes that a marriage is deemed legitimate in the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, whereas there is some impediment affecting its validity; which impediment may be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the parties who marry in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: or they may <a href="../cathen/04001a.htm">marry in secret</a> and be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the impediment, in which case their marriage would seem legitimate in the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, for the very reason that it is not prevented by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Therefore children born out of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> marriage are not <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Illegitimate is that which is against the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Now those who are born out of wedlock are born contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Therefore they are <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Children are of four <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>. Some are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and legitimate, for instance those who are born of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and lawful marriage; some are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a>, as those who are born of fornication; some are legitimate and not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, as adopted children; some are neither legitimate nor <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>; such are those born of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> or <a href="../cathen/07717a.htm">incest</a>, for these are born not only against the positive <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, but against the express <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>. Hence we must grant that some children are <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although those who are born of an unlawful intercourse are born according to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> common to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and all animals, they are born contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which is proper to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: since fornication, <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, and the like are contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence the like are not legitimate by any <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">Ignorance</a>, unless it be affected, excuses unlawful intercourse from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Wherefore those who contract together in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, although there be an impediment, of which however they are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not, nor are their children <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a>. If, however, they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of the impediment, although the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> upholds their marriage because she <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not of the impediment, they are not excused from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, nor do their children avoid being illegitimate. Neither are they excused if they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not of the impediment and marry secretly, because such <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> would appear to be affected.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether children should suffer any loss through being illegitimate?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that children ought not to suffer any loss through being <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a>. For a child should not be punished on account of his father's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to the Lord's saying (<a href="../bible/eze018.htm#verse20">Ezekiel 18:20</a>). But it is not his own but his father's fault that he is born of an unlawful union. Therefore he should not incur a loss on this account.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is copied from Divine. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> confers <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> goods equally on legitimate and <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> children. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> should be equalled to legitimate children according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laws.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is stated (<a href="../bible/gen025.htm#verse5">Genesis 25:5-6</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> gave all his possessions to <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, and that to the children of the <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubines</a> he gave <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>": and yet the latter were not born of an unlawful intercourse. Much more, therefore, ought those born of an unlawful intercourse to incur loss by not inheriting their father's property.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is said to incur a loss for some <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> in two ways: First, because he is deprived of his due, and thus an <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> child incurs no loss. Secondly, because something is not due to him, which might have been due otherwise, and thus an <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> son incurs a twofold loss. First because he is excluded from legitimate acts such as offices and dignities, which require a certain respectability in those who perform them. Secondly, he incurs a loss by not succeeding to his father's inheritance. Nevertheless <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> sons can inherit a sixth only, whereas spurious children cannot inherit any portion, although by <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> their parents are bound to provide for their needs. Hence it is part of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> care to compel both parents to provide for them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> To incur a loss in this second way is not a punishment. Hence we do not say that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is punished by not succeeding to the throne through not being the king's son. In like manner it is no punishment to an <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> child that he has no right to that which belongs to the legitimate children.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Illegitimate intercourse is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, not as an act of the generative power, but as proceeding from a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> will. Hence an <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> son incurs a loss, not in those things which come to him by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> origin, but in those things which are dependent on the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> for being done or possessed.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether an illegitimate son can be legitimized?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that an <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> son cannot be <a href="../cathen/09131e.htm">legitimized</a>. For the legitimate child is as far removed from the <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> as the <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> from the legitimate. But a legitimate child is never made <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a>. Neither, therefore, is an <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> child ever made legitimate.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> intercourse begets an <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> child. But <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> intercourse never becomes legitimate. Neither, therefore, can an <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> son become legitimate.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> What is done by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> can be undone by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimacy</a> of children is an effect of positive <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Therefore an <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> child can be <a href="../cathen/09131e.htm">legitimized</a> by one who has legal authority.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> An <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> child can be <a href="../cathen/09131e.htm">legitimized</a>, not so that he be born of a legitimate intercourse, because this intercourse is a thing of the past and can never be <a href="../cathen/09131e.htm">legitimized</a> from the moment that it was once <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a>. But the child is said to be <a href="../cathen/09131e.htm">legitimized</a>, in so far as the losses which an <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> child ought to incur are withdrawn by the authority of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p>There are six ways of becoming legitimate: two according to the canons (Cap. Conquestus; Cap. Tanta), namely when a man marries the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of whom he has an unlawful child (if it were not a case of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>), and by special <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> and dispensation of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">lord Pope</a>. The other four ways are according to the laws: (1) If the father offer his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> son to the emperor's court, for by this very fact the son is legitimate on account of the reputation of the court; (2) if the father designate him in his will as his legitimate heir, and the son afterwards offer the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to the emperor; (3) if there be no legitimate son and the son himself offer himself to the emperor (4) if the father designate him as legitimate in a public document or in a document signed by three <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>, without calling him <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A favor may be bestowed on a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> without <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, but a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> cannot be damnified except for a fault. Hence an <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> child can be <a href="../cathen/09131e.htm">legitimized</a> rather than "vice versa"; for although a legitimate son is sometimes deprived of his inheritance on account of his fault, he is not said to be <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a>, because he was legitimately begotten.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Illegitimate intercourse has an inherent inseparable defect whereby it is opposed to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>: and consequently it cannot be legitimized. Nor is there any comparison with an <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> child who has no such defect.
