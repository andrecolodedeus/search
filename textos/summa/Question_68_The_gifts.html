<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the Gifts differ from the virtues?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> do not differ from the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/job001.htm#verse2">Job 1:2</a>, "There were born to him seven sons," says (Moral. i, 12): "Seven sons were born to us, when through the conception of heavenly thought, the seven <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> take birth in us": and he quotes the words of <a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse2">Isaiah 11:2-3</a>: "And the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> . . . of understanding . . . shall rest upon him," etc. where the seven <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are enumerated. Therefore the seven <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse45">Matthew 12:45</a>, "Then he goeth and taketh with him seven other spirits," etc., says (De Quaest. Evang. i, qu. 8): "The seven <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are opposed to the seven <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>," i.e. to the seven <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>. Now the seven <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are opposed to the seven <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, commonly so called. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> do not differ from the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> commonly so called.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, things whose definitions are the same, are themselves the same. But the definition of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> applies to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>; for each <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> is "a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, whereby we lead a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> life," etc. [Cf. 55, 4]. Likewise the definition of a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> can apply to the infused <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: for a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> is "an unreturnable giving," according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Topic. iv, 4). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> do not differ from one another.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Several of the things mentioned among the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, are <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: for, as stated above (Question 57, Article 2), wisdom, understanding, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> are <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, counsel pertains to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, piety to a kind of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> do not differ from the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. i, 12) distinguishes seven <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, which he states to be denoted by the seven sons of <a href="../cathen/08413a.htm">Job</a>, from the three theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, which, he says, are signified by <a href="../cathen/08413a.htm">Job's</a> three daughters. He also distinguishes (Moral. ii, 26) the same seven <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> from the four cardinal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, which he says were signified by the four corners of the house.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> If we speak of <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> with regard to the notion conveyed by the words themselves, there is no opposition between them. Because the word "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>" conveys the notion that it perfects <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in relation to well-doing, while the word "<a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>" refers to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> from which it proceeds. Now there is no reason why that which proceeds from one as a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> should not perfect another in well-doing: especially as we have already stated (63, 3) that some <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are infused into us by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore in this respect we cannot differentiate <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> from <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Consequently some have held that the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are not to be distinguished from the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. But there remains no less a difficulty for them to solve; for they must explain why some <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are called <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> and some not; and why among the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> there are some, fear, for instance, that are not reckoned <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p>Hence it is that others have said that the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> should be held as being distinct from the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; yet they have not assigned a suitable reason for this distinction, a reason, to wit, which would apply either to all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and to none of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, or vice versa. For, seeing that of the seven <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, four belong to the reason, viz. wisdom, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, understanding and counsel, and three to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, viz. <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, piety and fear; they held that the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> perfect the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> according as it is a faculty of the reason, while the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> perfect it as a faculty of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: since they observed only two <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in the reason or <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, viz. <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, the others being in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power or the affections. If this distinction were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> would have to be in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, and all the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> in the reason.

<p>Others observing that <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. ii, 26) that "the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, by coming into the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> endows it with <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, and at the same time strengthens it against every kind of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> by His sevenfold <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>," said that the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are given us that we may do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works, and the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, that we may resist <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>. But neither is this distinction sufficient. Because the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> also resist those <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> which lead to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that are contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; for everything <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> resists its contrary: which is especially clear with regard to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, of which it is written (<a href="../bible/son008.htm#verse7">Canticles 8:7</a>): "Many waters cannot quench <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>."

<p>Others again, seeing that these <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are set down in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> as having been in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to <a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse2">Isaiah 11:2-3</a>, said that the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are given simply that we may do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works, but the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, in order to conform us to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, chiefly with regard to His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, for it was then that these <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> shone with the greatest splendor. Yet neither does this appear to be a satisfactory distinction. Because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> Himself wished us to be conformed to Him, chiefly in <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> and meekness, according to <a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse29">Matthew 11:29</a>: "Learn of Me, because I am meek and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> of heart," and in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse12">John 15:12</a>: "Love one another, as I have loved you." Moreover, these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> were especially resplendent in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>.

<p>Accordingly, in order to differentiate the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> from the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, we must be guided by the way in which <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> expresses itself, for we find there that the term employed is "spirit" rather than "<a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>." For thus it is written (<a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse2">Isaiah 11:2-3</a>): "The spirit . . . of wisdom and of understanding . . . shall rest upon him," etc.: from which words we are clearly given to understand that these seven are there set down as being in us by Divine inspiration. Now inspiration denotes motion from without. For it must be noted that in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> there is a twofold principle of movement, one within him, viz. the reason; the other extrinsic to him, viz. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated above (9, A4,6): moreover the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says this in the chapter On Good Fortune (Ethic. Eudem. vii, 8).

<p>Now it is evident that whatever is moved must be proportionate to its mover: and the perfection of the mobile as such, consists in a disposition whereby it is disposed to be well moved by its mover. Hence the more exalted the mover, the more perfect must be the disposition whereby the mobile is made proportionate to its mover: thus we see that a disciple needs a more perfect disposition in order to receive a higher teaching from his master. Now it is manifest that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> perfect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> according as it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> for him to be moved by his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> in his interior and exterior actions. Consequently <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs yet higher perfections, whereby to be disposed to be moved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. These perfections are called <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, not only because they are infused by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but also because by them <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is disposed to become amenable to the Divine inspiration, according to <a href="../bible/isa050.htm#verse5">Isaiah 50:5</a>: "The Lord . . . hath opened my ear, and I do not resist; I have not gone back." Even the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says in the chapter On Good Fortune (Ethic. Eudem., vii, 8) that for those who are moved by Divine instinct, there is no need to take counsel according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, but only to follow their inner promptings, since they are moved by a principle higher than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. This then is what some say, viz. that the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> perfect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for acts which are higher than acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Sometimes these <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are called <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, in the broad sense of the word. Nevertheless, they have something over and above the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> understood in this broad way, in so far as they are Divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, perfecting <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as moved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vii, 1) above <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> commonly so called, places a kind of "heroic" or "divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> [<em>arete heroike kai theia</em>]," in respect of which some men are called "divine."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are opposed to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, in so far as they are opposed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as appointed by reason; but they are opposed to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, in as much as they are opposed to the Divine instinct. For the same thing is opposed both to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to reason, whose light flows from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This definition applies to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> taken in its general sense. Consequently, if we wish to restrict it to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> as distinguished from the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, we must explain the words, "whereby we lead a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> life" as referring to the rectitude of life which is measured by the rule of reason. Likewise the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, as distinct from infused <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, may be defined as something given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in relation to His motion; something, to wit, that makes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to follow well the promptings of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Wisdom is called an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, so far as it proceeds from the judgment of reason: but it is called a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, according as its work proceeds from the Divine prompting. The same applies to the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the gifts are necessary to man for salvation?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Because the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are ordained to a perfection surpassing the ordinary perfection of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> that he should attain to a perfection surpassing the ordinary standard of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; because such perfection falls, not under the precept, but under a counsel. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is enough, for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, that he behave well in matters concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and matters concerning <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> behavior to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is sufficiently directed by the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; and his behavior towards men, by the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. ii, 26) that "the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> gives wisdom against folly, understanding against dullness, counsel against rashness, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> against <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> against <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, piety against hardness of our heart, and fear against <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>." But a sufficient remedy for all these things is to be found in the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Of all the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, wisdom seems to be the highest, and fear the lowest. Now each of these is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: since of wisdom it is written (<a href="../bible/wis007.htm#verse28">Wisdom 7:28</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> loveth none but him that dwelleth with wisdom"; and of fear (<a href="../bible/sir001.htm#verse28">Sirach 1:28</a>): "He that is without fear cannot be justified." Therefore the other <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> that are placed between these are also <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are perfections of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, whereby he is disposed so as to be amenable to the promptings of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore in those matters where the prompting of reason is not sufficient, and there is need for the prompting of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, there is, in consequence, need for a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>.

<p>Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> reason is perfected by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in two ways: first, with its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> perfection, to wit, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> light of reason; secondly, with a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> perfection, to wit, the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as stated above (Question 62, Article 1). And, though this latter perfection is greater than the former, yet the former is possessed by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in a more perfect manner than the latter: because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has the former in his full possession, whereas he possesses the latter imperfectly, since we love and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> imperfectly. Now it is evident that anything that has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or a form or a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> perfectly, can of itself work according to them: not, however, excluding the operation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who works inwardly in every <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and in every will. On the other hand, that which has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, or form, or <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> imperfectly, cannot of itself work, unless it be moved by another. Thus the sun which possesses light perfectly, can shine by itself; whereas the moon which has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of light imperfectly, sheds only a borrowed light. Again, a physician, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the medical art perfectly, can work by himself; but his pupil, who is not yet fully instructed, cannot work by himself, but needs to receive instructions from him.

<p>Accordingly, in matters subject to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, and directed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> connatural end, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can work through the judgment of his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. If, however, even in these things <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> receive help in the shape of special promptings from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, this will be out of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> superabundant <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>: hence, according to the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, not every one that had the acquired moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, had also the heroic or divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. But in matters directed to the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> end, to which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> reason moves him, according as it is, in a manner, and imperfectly, informed by the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, the motion of reason does not suffice, unless it receive in addition the prompting or motion of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse14">Romans 8:14-17</a>: "Whosoever are led by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, they are sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> . . . and if sons, heirs also": and <a href="../bible/psa142.htm#verse10">Psalm 142:10</a>: "Thy <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> Spirit shall lead me into the right land," because, to wit, none can receive the inheritance of that land of the Blessed, except he be moved and led thither by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Therefore, in order to accomplish this end, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to have the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> surpass the ordinary perfection of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, not as regards the kind of works (as the counsels surpass the commandments), but as regards the manner of working, in respect of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> being moved by a higher principle.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> By the theological and moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not so perfected in respect of his last end, as not to stand in continual need of being moved by the yet higher promptings of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, for the reason already given.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Whether we consider <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> as perfected in its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> perfection, or as perfected by the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, it does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things, nor all possible things. Consequently it is unable to avoid folly and other like things mentioned in the objection. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, however, to Whose <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and power all things are subject, by His motion safeguards us from all folly, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, dullness of mind and hardness of heart, and the rest. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, which make us amenable to His promptings, are said to be given as remedies to these defects.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the gifts of the Holy Ghost are habits?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are not <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>. Because a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> abiding in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, being defined as "a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> difficult to remove," as stated in the Predicaments (Categor. vi). Now it is proper to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> that the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> rest in Him, as stated in <a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse2">Isaiah 11:2-3</a>: "He upon Whom thou shalt see the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> descending and remaining upon Him, He it is that baptizeth"; on which words <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> comments as follows (Moral. ii, 27): "The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> comes upon all the faithful; but, in a singular way, He dwells always in the Mediator." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are not <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> perfect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> according as he is moved by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, as stated above (1,2). But in so far as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is moved by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, he is somewhat like an instrument in His regard. Now to be perfected by a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is befitting, not an instrument, but a principal agent. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are not <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are due to Divine inspiration, so is the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>: for "the spirit of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> does not always reside in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>," as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> states (Hom. i in Ezechiel). Neither, therefore, are the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> in speaking of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> said to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse17">John 14:17</a>): "He shall abide with you, and shall be in you." Now the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is not in a man without His <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>. Therefore His <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> abide in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore they are not merely acts or <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> but abiding <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are perfections of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, whereby he becomes amenable to the promptings of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Now it is evident from what has been already said (56, 4; 58, 2), that the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> perfect the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power according as it partakes somewhat of the reason, in so far, to wit, as it has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> aptitude to be moved by the command of reason. Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as compared with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> Himself, are related to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, even as the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, in comparison with the reason, are related to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power. Now the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, whereby the powers of <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> are disposed to obey reason promptly. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is perfected to obey readily the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> solves this objection (Moral. ii, 27) by saying that "by those <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> without which one cannot obtain life, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> ever abides in all the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>, but not by His other <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>." Now the seven <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Therefore, with regard to them, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> ever abides in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument holds, in the case of an instrument which has no faculty of action, but only of being acted upon. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not an instrument of that kind; for he is so acted upon, by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, that he also acts himself, in so far as he has a <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. Therefore he needs a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Prophecy is one of those <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> which are for the manifestation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, not for the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: hence the comparison fails.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost are suitably enumerated?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that seven <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are unsuitably enumerated. For in that enumeration four are set down corresponding to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, viz. wisdom, understanding, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and counsel, which corresponds to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>; whereas nothing is set down corresponding to art, which is the fifth <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Moreover, something is included corresponding to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, viz. piety, and something corresponding to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, viz. the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>; while there is nothing to correspond to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are enumerated insufficiently.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, piety is a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. But no part of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is assigned to correspond thereto, but <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> itself. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> itself, and not piety, ought to have been set down.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, more than any, direct us to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Since, then, the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> perfect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> according as he is moved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it seems that some <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, corresponding to the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, should have been included.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, even as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is an object of fear, so is He of love, of hope, and of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. Now love, hope, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> are <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> condivided with fear. Therefore, as fear is set down as a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, so ought the other three.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, wisdom is added in order to direct understanding; counsel, to direct <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>; <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, to direct piety. Therefore, some <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> should have been added for the purpose of directing fear. Therefore the seven <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are unsuitably enumerated.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> stands the authority of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> (<a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse2">Isaiah 11:2-3</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> perfecting <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> so that he is ready to follow the promptings of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, even as the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> perfect the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> powers so that they obey the reason. Now just as it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> for the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> powers to be moved by the command of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, so it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> for all the forces in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be moved by the instinct of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as by a superior power. Therefore whatever powers in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can be the principles of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions, can also be the subjects of <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, even as they are <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; and such powers are the reason and <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p>Now the reason is speculative and practical: and in both we find the apprehension of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> (which pertains to the discovery of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>), and judgment concerning the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Accordingly, for the apprehension of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the speculative reason is perfected by "understanding"; the practical reason, by "counsel." In order to judge aright, the speculative reason is perfected by "wisdom"; the practical reason by "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>." The <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, in matters touching a man's relations to another, is perfected by "piety"; in matters touching himself, it is perfected by "<a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>" against the fear of dangers; and against inordinate <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> for pleasures, by "fear," according to <a href="../bible/pro015.htm#verse27">Proverbs 15:27</a>: "By the fear of the Lord every one declineth from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>," and <a href="../bible/psa118.htm#verse120">Psalm 118:120</a>: "Pierce Thou my flesh with Thy fear: for I am afraid of Thy judgments." Hence it is clear that these <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> extend to all those things to which the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, both <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and moral, extend.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> perfect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in matters concerning a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> life: whereas art is not directed to such matters, but to external things that can be made, since art is the right reason, not about things to be done, but about things to be made (Ethic. vi, 4). However, we may say that, as regards the infusion of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, the art is on the part of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, Who is the principal mover, and not on the part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, who are His organs when He moves them. The <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of fear corresponds, in a manner, to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>: for just as it belongs to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, properly speaking, to restrain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> pleasures for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> appointed by reason, so does it belong to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of fear, to withdraw <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> pleasures through fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Justice is so called from the rectitude of the reason, and so it is more suitably called a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>. But the name of piety denotes the reverence which we give to our father and to our country. And since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the Father of all, the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is also called piety, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Civ. Dei x, 1). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> whereby a man, through reverence for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, works <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to all, is fittingly called piety.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The mind of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not moved by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, unless in some way it be united to Him: even as the instrument is not moved by the craftsman, unless there by contact or some other kind of union between them. Now the primal union of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: and, consequently, these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are presupposed to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, as being their roots. Therefore all the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> correspond to these three <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as being derived therefrom.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Love, hope and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> have <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for their object. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the Sovereign Good: wherefore the names of these <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are transferred to the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which unite <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. On the other hand, the object of fear is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, which can nowise apply to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: hence fear does not denote union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but withdrawal from certain things through reverence for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence it does not give its name to a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but to a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, which withdraws us from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, for higher motives than moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> does.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Wisdom directs both the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and the affections of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Hence two <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are set down as corresponding to wisdom as their directing principle; on the part of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding; on the part of the affections, the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of fear. Because the principal reason for fearing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is taken from a consideration of the Divine excellence, which wisdom considers.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the gifts of the Holy Ghost are connected?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are not connected, for the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse8">1 Corinthians 12:8</a>): "To one . . . by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, is given the word of wisdom, and to another, the word of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, according to the same Spirit." Now wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> are reckoned among the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are given to divers men, and are not connected together in the same <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiv, 1) that "many of the faithful have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, though they have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>." But some of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, at least the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of fear, accompany <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> connected together in one and the same <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. i) that wisdom "is of small account if it lack understanding, and understanding is wholly useless if it be not based upon wisdom . . . Counsel is worthless, when the strength of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is lacking thereto . . . and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is very weak if it be not supported by counsel . . . <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowledge</a> is nought if it hath not the use of piety . . . and piety is very useless if it lack the discernment of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> . . . and assuredly, unless it has these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> with it, fear itself rises up to the doing of no <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> action": from which it seems that it is possible to have one <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> without another. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are not connected.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> prefaces the passage above quoted, with the following remark: "It is worthy of note in this feast of <a href="../cathen/08413a.htm">Job's</a> sons, that by turns they fed one another." Now the sons of <a href="../cathen/08413a.htm">Job</a>, of whom he is speaking, denote the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are connected together by strengthening one another.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> answer to this question is easily gathered from what has been already set down. For it has been stated (3) that as the powers of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> are disposed by the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> as regards the governance of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, so all the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are disposed by the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> as regards the motion of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> dwells in us by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans 5:5</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is poured forth in our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, Who is given to us," even as our reason is perfected by <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Wherefore, just as the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are united together in <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, so the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are connected together in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: so that whoever has <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> has all the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, none of which can one possess without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> can be considered in one way as gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>, in so far, to wit, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> so far abounds in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things Divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, that he is able both to instruct the believer and confound the unbeliever. It is in this sense that the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> speaks, in this passage, about wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: hence he mentions pointedly the "word" of wisdom and the "word" of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. They may be taken in another way for the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: and thus wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> are nothing else but perfections of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind, rendering it amenable to the promptings of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things Divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>. Consequently it is clear that these <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are in all who are possessed of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is speaking there of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, while expounding the passage of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> quoted above (Objection 1): hence he is referring to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, in the sense already explained, as a gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. This is clear from the context which follows: "For it is one thing to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> only what a man must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in order to gain the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">blissful</a> life, which is no other than <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>; and another, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to impart this to godly <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and to defend it against the ungodly, which latter the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> seems to have styled by the proper name of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Just as the connection of the cardinal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in one way from the fact that one is, in a manner, perfected by another, as stated above (Question 65, Article 1); so <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> wishes to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the connection of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, in the same way, from the fact that one cannot be perfect without the other. Hence he had already observed that "each particular <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is to the last degree destitute, unless one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> lend its support to another." We are therefore not to understand that one <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> can be without another; but that if understanding were without wisdom, it would not be a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>; even as <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, without <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, would not be a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the gifts of the Holy Ghost remain in heaven?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> do not remain in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. ii, 26) that by means of His sevenfold <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> the "<a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> instructs the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> against all <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>." Now there will be no <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, according to <a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse9">Isaiah 11:9</a>: "They shall not hurt, nor shall they kill in all My <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mountain." Therefore there will be no <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). But <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are of no use, where their acts are impossible. Now the acts of some <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are not possible in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>; for <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. i, 15) that "understanding . . . penetrates the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> heard . . . counsel . . . stays us from acting rashly . . . <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> . . . has no fear of adversity . . . piety satisfies the inmost heart with <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of mercy," all of which are incompatible with the heavenly state. Therefore these <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> will not remain in the state of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, some of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> perfect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the contemplative life, e.g. wisdom and understanding: and some in the active life, e.g. piety and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. Now the active life ends with this as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> states (Moral. vi). Therefore not all the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> will be in the state of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Spiritu Sancto i, 20): "The city of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the heavenly Jerusalem is not washed with the waters of an earthly river: it is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, of Whose outpouring we but taste, Who, proceeding from the Fount of life, seems to flow more abundantly in those celestial spirits, a seething torrent of sevenfold heavenly <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We may speak of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> in two ways: first, as to their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; and thus they will be most perfectly in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, as may be gathered from the passage of <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a>, just quoted. The reason for this is that the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> render the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind amenable to the motion of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: which will be especially realized in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, where <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will be "all in all" (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse28">1 Corinthians 15:28</a>), and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> entirely subject unto Him. Secondly, they may be considered as regards the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> about which their operations are: and thus, in the present life they have an operation about a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, in respect of which they will have no operation in the state of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Considered in this way, they will not remain in the state of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; just as we have stated to be the case with regard to the cardinal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> (67, 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> is speaking there of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> according as they are compatible with the present state: for it is thus that they afford us protection against <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>. But in the state of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, where all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will have ceased, we shall be perfected in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, in almost every <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, includes something that passes away with the present state, and something that remains in the future state. For he says that "wisdom strengthens the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> with the hope and <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> things"; of which two, hope passes, and <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> remains. Of understanding, he says "that it penetrates the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> heard, refreshing the heart and enlightening its darkness," of which, hearing passes away, since "they shall teach no more every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> . . . his brother" (<a href="../bible/jer031.htm#verse3">Jeremiah 31:3-4</a>); but the enlightening of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> remains. Of counsel he says that it "prevents us from being impetuous," which is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in the present life; and also that "it makes the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> full of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>," which is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> even in the future state. Of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> he says that it "fears not adversity," which is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in the present life; and further, that it "sets before us the viands of confidence," which remains also in the future life. With regard to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> he mentions only one thing, viz. that "she overcomes the void of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>," which refers to the present state. When, however, he adds "in the womb of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>," this may refer figuratively to the fulness of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which belongs to the future state. Of piety he says that "it satisfies the inmost heart with <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of mercy." These words taken literally refer only to the present state: yet the inward regard for our neighbor, signified by "the inmost heart," belongs also to the future state, when piety will achieve, not <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">works of mercy</a>, but fellowship of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. Of fear he say that "it oppresses the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, lest it <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> itself in present things," which refers to the present state, and that "it strengthens it with the meat of hope for the future," which also belongs to the present state, as regards hope, but may also refer to the future state, as regards being "strengthened" for things we hope are here, and obtain there.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument considers the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> as to their <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> will not be the works of the active life; but all the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> will have their respective acts about things pertaining to the contemplative life, which is the life of heavenly bliss.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the gifts are set down by Isaias in their order of dignity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are not set down by Isaias in their order of dignity. For the principal <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> is, seemingly, that which, more than the others, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> requires of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> requires of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> fear, more than the other <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>: for it is written (<a href="../bible/deu010.htm#verse12">Deuteronomy 10:12</a>): "And now, <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, what doth the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> require of thee, but that thou fear the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>?" and (<a href="../bible/mal001.htm#verse6">Malachi 1:6</a>): "If . . . I be a master, where is My fear?" Therefore it seems that fear, which is mentioned last, is not the lowest but the greatest of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, piety seems to be a kind of common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; since the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse8">1 Timothy 4:8</a>): "Piety [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: '<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">Godliness</a>'] is profitable to all things." Now a common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is preferable to particular goods. Therefore piety, which is given the last place but one, seems to be the most excellent <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> perfects <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> judgment, while counsel pertains to inquiry. But judgment is more excellent than inquiry. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is a more excellent <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> than counsel; and yet it is set down as being below it.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> pertains to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, while science belongs to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. But reason is a more excellent power than the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is a more excellent <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> than <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>; and yet the latter is given the precedence. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are not set down in their order of dignity.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says [De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 4: "It seems to me that the sevenfold operation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, of which Isaias speaks, agrees in degrees and expression with these [of which we read in <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse3">Matthew 5:3</a>: but there is a difference of order, for there [viz. in Isaias] the enumeration begins with the more excellent <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, here, with the lower <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The excellence of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> can be measured in two ways: first, simply, viz. by comparison to their proper acts as proceeding from their principles; secondly, relatively, viz. by comparison to their <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. If we consider the excellence of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> simply, they follow the same rule as the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as to their comparison one with another; because the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> perfect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for all the acts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> powers, even as the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> do, as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>). Hence, as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> have the precedence of the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and among the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, the contemplative are preferable to the active, viz. wisdom, understanding and science to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and art (yet so that wisdom stands before understanding, and understanding before science, and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and synesis before eubulia): so also among the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, wisdom, understanding, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and counsel are more excellent than piety, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, and fear; and among the latter, piety excels <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> fear, even as <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> surpasses <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>. But in regard to their <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> and counsel precede <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and piety: because <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> and counsel are concerned with difficult matters, whereas piety and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> regard ordinary matters. Consequently the excellence of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> corresponds with the order in which they are enumerated; but so far as wisdom and understanding are given the preference to the others, their excellence is considered simply, while, so far, as counsel and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> are preferred to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and piety, it is considered with regard to their <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Fear is chiefly required as being the foundation, so to speak, of the perfection of the other <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, for "the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom" (<a href="../bible/psa110.htm#verse10">Psalm 110:10</a>; <a href="../bible/sir001.htm#verse16">Sirach 1:16</a>), and not as though it were more excellent than the others. Because, in the order of generation, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> departs from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> on account of fear (<a href="../bible/pro016.htm#verse16">Proverbs 16:16</a>), before doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works, and which result from the other <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In the words quoted from the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>, piety is not compared with all <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, but only with "bodily exercise," of which he had said it "is profitable to little."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> stands before counsel by reason of its judgment, yet counsel is more excellent by reason of its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: for counsel is only concerned with matters of difficulty (Ethic. iii, 3), whereas the judgment of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> embraces all matters.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The directive <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> which pertain to the reason are more excellent than the executive <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, if we consider them in relation to their acts as proceeding from their powers, because reason transcends the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> as a rule transcends the thing ruled. But on the part of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, counsel is united to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> as the directive power to the executive, and so is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> united to piety: because counsel and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> are concerned with matters of difficulty, while <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and piety are concerned with ordinary matters. Hence counsel together with <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, by reason of their <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, are given the preference to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and piety.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether the virtues are more excellent than the gifts?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are more excellent than the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xv, 18) while speaking of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: "No <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is more excellent than this. It is this alone which divides the children of the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal kingdom</a> from the children of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> damnation. Other <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are bestowed by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, but, without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, they avail nothing." But <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is more excellent than the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which is first <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, seems to be more excellent. Now the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> precede the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; for <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. ii, 26) that "the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> it works on, forms first of all <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> . . . and doth afterwards give it a temper in the seven <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>" [viz. the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>], so "as against folly to bestow wisdom; against dullness, understanding; against rashness, counsel; against fear, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>; against <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; against hardness of heart, piety; against piety, fear." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are more excellent than the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Lib. Arb. ii, 19) that "the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> cannot be used to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> purpose." But it is possible to make <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> use of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, for <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. i, 18): "We offer up the sacrifice of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> . . . lest wisdom may uplift; or understanding, while it runs nimbly, deviate from the right path; or counsel, while it multiplies itself, grow into confusion; that <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, while it gives confidence, may not make us rash; lest <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, while it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> and yet loves not, may swell the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>; lest piety, while it swerves from the right line, may become distorted; and lest fear, while it is unduly alarmed, may plunge us into the pit of <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are more excellent than the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are bestowed to assist the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and to remedy certain defects, as is shown in the passage quoted (Objection 2), so that, seemingly, they accomplish what the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> cannot. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are more excellent than the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was shown above (58, 3; 62, 1), there are three kinds of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: for some are theological, some <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, and some moral. The theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are those whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> mind is united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are those whereby reason itself is perfected; and the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are those which perfect the powers of <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> in obedience to the reason. On the other hand the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> dispose all the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be amenable to the Divine motion.

<p>Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> seem to be compared to the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, by which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is united to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> his Mover, in the same way as the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are compared to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, which perfect the reason, the moving principle of the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Wherefore as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are more excellent than the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and control them, so the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are more excellent than the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and regulate them. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. i, 12) that "the seven sons," i.e. the seven <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, "never attain the perfection of the number ten, unless all they do be done in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>."

<p>But if we compare the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> to the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and moral, then the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> have the precedence of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Because the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> perfect the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> powers in relation to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> their Mover; whereas the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> perfect, either the reason itself, or the other powers in relation to reason: and it is evident that the more exalted the mover, the more excellent the disposition whereby the thing moved requires to be disposed. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are more perfect than the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> is a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and such we grant to be more perfect than the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> There are two ways in which one thing precedes another. One is in order of perfection and dignity, as love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> precedes love of our neighbor: and in this way the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> precede the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, but follow the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. The other is the order of generation or disposition: thus love of one's neighbor precedes love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as regards the act: and in this way moral and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> precede the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, through being well subordinate to his own reason, is disposed to be rightly subordinate to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Wisdom and understanding and the like are <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, according as they are quickened by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which "dealeth not perversely" (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse4">1 Corinthians 13:4</a>). Consequently wisdom and understanding and the like cannot be used to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> purpose, in so far as they are <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. But, lest they depart from the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, they assist one another. This is what <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> means to say.
