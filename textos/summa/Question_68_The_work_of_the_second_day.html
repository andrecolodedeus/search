<h1>Question 68. The work of the second day</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1068.htm#article1"> Was the firmament made on the second day?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1068.htm#article2"> Are there waters above the firmament?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1068.htm#article3"> Does the firmament divide waters from waters?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1068.htm#article4"> Is there more than one heaven?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the firmament was made on the second day?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> was not made on the second day. For it is said (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse8">Genesis 1:8</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> called the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> before days, as is clear from the words, "In the beginning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> was not made on the second day.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the work of the six days is ordered conformably to the order of Divine wisdom. Now it would ill become the Divine wisdom to make afterwards that which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> first. But though the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> precedes the earth and the waters, these are mentioned before the formation of light, which was on the first day. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> was not made on the second day.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, all that was made in the six days was formed out of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> before days began. But the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> cannot have been formed out of pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, for if so it would be liable to generation and corruption. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> was not made on the second day.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse6">Genesis 1:6</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> said: let there be a <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a>," and further on (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse8">verse 8</a>); "And the evening and morning were the second day."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In discussing questions of this kind two rules are to observed, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> teaches (Gen. ad lit. i, 18). The first is, to hold the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> without wavering. The second is that since <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Scripture</a> can be explained in a multiplicity of senses, one should adhere to a particular explanation, only in such measure as to be ready to abandon it, if it be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>; lest <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Scripture</a> be exposed to the ridicule of unbelievers, and obstacles be placed to their <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a>.

<p>We say, therefore, that the words which speak of the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> as made on the second day can be understood in two senses. They may be understood, first, of the starry <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a>, on which point it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to set forth the different opinions of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>. Some of these <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> it to be composed of the elements; and this was the opinion of Empedocles, who, however, held further that the body of the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> was not susceptible of dissolution, because its parts are, so to say, not in disunion, but in harmony. Others held the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> to be of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the four elements, not, indeed, compounded of them, but being as it were a simple element. Such was the opinion of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, who held that element to be fire. Others, again, have held that the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is not of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the four elements, but is itself a fifth body, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> over and above these. This is the opinion of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> (De Coel. i, text. 6,32).

<p>According to the first opinion, it may, strictly speaking, be granted that the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> was made, even as to <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, on the second day. For it is part of the work of creation to produce the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the elements, while it belongs to the work of distinction and adornment to give forms to the elements that pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>.

<p>But the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> that the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> was made, as to its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, on the second day is incompatible with the opinion of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, according to whom the making of the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> implies the production of the element of fire. This production, however, belongs to the work of creation, at least, according to those who hold that formlessness of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> preceded in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> its formation, since the first form received by <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is the elemental.

<p>Still less compatible with the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> was produced on the second day is the opinion of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, seeing that the mention of days denotes succession of time, whereas the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a>, being <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> incorruptible, is of a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> not susceptible of change of form; wherefore it could not be made out of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> antecedently in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>.

<p>Hence to produce the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> belongs to the work of creation. But its formation, in some degree, belongs to the second day, according to both opinions: for as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv), the light of the sun was without form during the first three days, and afterwards, on the fourth day, received its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>.

<p>If, however, we take these days to denote merely sequence in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> holds (Gen. ad lit. iv, 22,24), and not succession in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, there is then nothing to prevent our saying, whilst holding any one of the opinions given above, that the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> formation of the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> belongs to the second day.

<p>Another possible explanation is to understand by the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> that was made on the second day, not that in which the stars are set, but the part of the atmosphere where the clouds are collected, and which has received the name <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> from the firmness and density of the air. "For a body is called firm," that is dense and solid, "thereby differing from a mathematical body" as is remarked by <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a> (Hom. iii in Hexaem.). If, then, this explanation is adopted none of these opinions will be found repugnant to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, in fact (Gen. ad lit. ii, 4), recommends it thus: "I consider this view of the question worthy of all commendation, as neither contrary to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> nor difficult to be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> (Hom. iii in Genes.), <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> prefaces his record by speaking of the works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> collectively, in the words, "In the beginning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth," and then proceeds to explain them part by part; in somewhat the same way as one might say: "This house was constructed by that builder," and then add: "First, he laid the foundations, then built the walls, and thirdly, put on the roof." In accepting this explanation we are, therefore, not bound to hold that a different <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is spoken of in the words: "In the beginning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth," and when we read that the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> was made on the second day.

<p>We may also say that the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> recorded as <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in the beginning is not the same as that made on the second day; and there are several senses in which this may be understood. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. i, 9) that the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> recorded as made on the first day is the formless <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and that the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> of the second day is the corporeal <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. According to <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> (Hexaem. i) and Strabus, the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> made on the first day is the empyrean, and the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> made on the second day, the starry <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. According to <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. ii) that of the first day was spherical in <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> and without stars, the same, in fact, that the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> speak of, calling it the ninth sphere, and the primary movable body that moves with diurnal movement: while by the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> made on the second day he understands the starry <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. According to another theory, touched upon by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [Gen. ad lit. ii, 1] the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> made on the first day was the starry <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> made on the second day was that region of the air where the clouds are collected, which is also called <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, but equivocally. And to show that the word is here used in an equivocal sense, it is expressly said that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> called the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>"; just as in a preceding verse it said that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> called the light day" (since the word "day" is also used to denote a space of twenty-four hours). Other instances of a similar use occur, as pointed out by <a href="../cathen/09540b.htm">Rabbi Moses</a>.

<p>The second and third objections are sufficiently answered by what has been already said.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether there are waters above the firmament?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there are not waters above the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a>. For water is heavy by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and heavy things tend <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> downwards, not upwards. Therefore there are not waters above the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, water is fluid by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and fluids cannot rest on a sphere, as experience shows. Therefore, since the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> is a sphere, there cannot be water above it.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, water is an element, and appointed to the generation of composite bodies, according to the relation in which imperfect things stand towards perfect. But bodies of composite <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> have their place upon the earth, and not above the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a>, so that water would be useless there. But none of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> works are useless. Therefore there are not waters above the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse7">Genesis 1:7</a>): "(<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>) divided the waters that were under the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a>, from those that were above the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a>."

<p>I answer with <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. ii, 5) that, "These words of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> have more authority than the most exalted <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Hence, whatever these waters are, and whatever their mode of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, we cannot for a moment <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that they are there." As to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of these waters, all are not agreed. <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> says (Hom. i in Gen.) that the waters that are above the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> are "<a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>." Wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/psa148.htm#verse4">Psalm 148:4</a>): "Let the waters that are above the heavens praise the name of the Lord," and (<a href="../bible/dan003.htm#verse60">Daniel 3:60</a>): "Ye waters that are above the heavens, <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> the Lord."To this <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a> answers (Hom. iii in Hexaem.) that these words do not mean that these waters are rational creatures, but that "the thoughtful <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of them by those who understand fulfils the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a>." Hence in the same context, fire, hail, and other like creatures, are invoked in the same way, though no one would attribute reason to these.

<p>We must hold, then, these waters to be material, but their exact <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> will be differently defined according as opinions on the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> differ. For if by the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> we understand the starry <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and as being of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the four elements, for the same reason it may be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that the waters above the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> are of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as the elemental waters. But if by the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> we understand the starry <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, not, however, as being of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the four elements then the waters above the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> will not be of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as the elemental waters, but just as, according to Strabus, one <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is called empyrean, that is, fiery, solely on account of its splendor: so this other <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> will be called aqueous solely on account of its transparence; and this <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is above the starry heaven. Again, if the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> is held to be of other <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> than the elements, it may still be said to divide the waters, if we understand by water not the element but formless <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, in fact, says (Super Gen. cont. Manich. i, 5,7) that whatever divides bodies from bodies can be said to divide waters from waters.

<p>If, however, we understand by the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> that part of the air in which the clouds are collected, then the waters above the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> must rather be the vapors resolved from the waters which are raised above a part of the atmosphere, and from which the rain falls. But to say, as some writers alluded to by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. ii, 4), that waters resolved into vapor may be lifted above the starry <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, is a mere absurdity. The solid <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a>, the intervening region of fire, wherein all vapor must be consumed, the tendency in light and rarefied bodies to drift to one spot beneath the vault of the moon, as well as the fact that vapors are perceived not to rise even to the tops of the higher mountains, all to go to show the impossibility of this. Nor is it less absurd to say, in support of this opinion, that bodies may be rarefied <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a>, since <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> bodies cannot be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> rarefied or divided, but up to a certain point only.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Some have attempted to solve this difficulty by supposing that in spite of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> gravity of water, it is kept in its place above the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> by the Divine power. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. ii, 1), however will not admit this solution, but says "It is our business here to inquire how <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has constituted the natures of His creatures, not how far it may have pleased Him to work on them by way of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>." We leave this view, then, and answer that according to the last two opinions on the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> and the waters the solution appears from what has been said. According to the first opinion, an order of the elements must be supposed different from that given by <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, that is to say, that the waters surrounding the earth are of a dense consistency, and those around the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> of a rarer consistency, in proportion to the respective density of the earth and of the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<p>Or by the water, as stated, we may understand the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of bodies to be signified.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The solution is clear from what has been said, according to the last two opinions. But according to the first opinion, <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a> gives two replies (Hom. iii in Hexaem.). He answers first, that a body seen as concave beneath need not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> be rounded, or convex, above.

<p>Secondly, that the waters above the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> are not fluid, but <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> outside it in a solid state, as a mass of ice, and that this is the crystalline <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> of some writers.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> According to the third opinion given, the waters above the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> have been raised in the form of vapors, and serve to give rain to the earth. But according to the second opinion, they are above the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> that is wholly transparent and starless. This, according to some, is the primary mobile, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the daily revolution of the entire <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, whereby the continuance of generation is secured. In the same way the starry <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, by the zodiacal movement, is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> whereby different bodies are generated or corrupted, through the rising and setting of the stars, and their various influences. But according to the first opinion these waters are set there to temper the heat of the celestial bodies, as <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a> supposes (Hom. iii in Hexaem.). And <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. ii, 5) that some have considered this to be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the extreme cold of Saturn owing to its nearness to the waters that are above the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the firmament divides waters from waters?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> does not divide waters from waters. For bodies that are of one and the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> have <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> one and the same place. But the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Topic. i, 6): "All water is the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>." Water therefore cannot be distinct from water by place.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, should it be said that the waters above the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> differ in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from those under the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a>, it may be argued, on the contrary, that things distinct in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> need nothing else to distinguish them. If then, these waters differ in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, it is not the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> that distinguishes them.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it would appear that what distinguishes waters from waters must be something which is in contact with them on either side, as a wall standing in the midst of a river. But it is evident that the waters below do not reach up to the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> does not divide the waters from the waters.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse6">Genesis 1:6</a>): "Let there be a <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> made amidst the waters; and let it divide the waters from the waters."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The text of Genesis, considered superficially, might lead to the adoption of a theory similar to that held by certain <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of antiquity, who taught that water was a body <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in dimension, and the primary element of all bodies. Thus in the words, "Darkness was upon the face of the deep," the word "deep" might be taken to mean the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> mass of water, understood as the principle of all other bodies. These <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> also taught that not all corporeal things are confined beneath the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> perceived by our senses, but that a body of water, <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in extent, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> above that <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. On this view the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> might be said to divide the waters without from those within--that is to say, from all bodies under the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, since they took water to be the principle of them all.

<p>As, however, this theory can be shown to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> by solid reasons, it cannot be held to be the sense of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Scripture</a>. It should rather be considered that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was speaking to <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> people, and that out of condescension to their weakness he put before them only such things as are apparent to sense. Now even the most uneducated can perceive by their senses that earth and water are corporeal, whereas it is not evident to all that air also is corporeal, for there have even been <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> who said that air is nothing, and called a space filled with air a vacuum.

<p><a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, then, while he expressly mentions water and earth, makes no express mention of air by name, to avoid setting before <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> something beyond their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. In order, however, to express the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to those capable of understanding it, he implies in the words: "Darkness was upon the face of the deep," the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of air as attendant, so to say, upon the water. For it may be understood from these words that over the face of the water a transparent body was extended, the subject of light and darkness, which, in fact, is the air.

<p>Whether, then, we understand by the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> the starry <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, or the cloudy region of the air, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to say that it divides the waters from the waters, according as we take water to denote formless <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, or any kind of transparent body, as fittingly designated under the name of waters. For the starry <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> divides the lower transparent bodies from the higher, and the cloudy region divides that higher part of the air, where the rain and similar things are generated, from the lower part, which is connected with the water and included under that name.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> If by the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> is understood the starry <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, the waters above are not of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> as those beneath. But if by the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> is understood the cloudy region of the air, both these waters are of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and two places are assigned to them, though not for the same purpose, the higher being the place of their begetting, the lower, the place of their repose.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> If the waters are held to differ in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> cannot be said to divide the waters, as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of their destruction, but only as the boundary of each.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> On account of the air and other similar bodies being invisible, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> includes all such bodies under the name of water, and thus it is evident that waters are found on each side of the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a>, whatever be the sense in which the word is used.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether there is only one heaven?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is only one <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is contrasted with the earth, in the words, "In the beginning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth."But there is only one earth. Therefore there is only one <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which consists of the entire sum of its own <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, must be one; and such is the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proves (De Coel. i, text. 95). Therefore there is but one <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whatever is predicated of many things univocally is predicated of them according to some common notion. But if there are more heavens than one, they are so called univocally, for if equivocally only, they could not properly be called many. If, then, they are many, there must be some common notion by reason of which each is called <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, but this common notion cannot be assigned. Therefore there cannot be more than one <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/psa148.htm#verse4">Psalm 148:4</a>): "Praise Him, ye heavens of heavens."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> On this point there seems to be a diversity of opinion between <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a> and <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>. The latter says that there is only one <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> (Hom. iv in Gen.), and that the words 'heavens of heavens' are merely the translation of the Hebrew idiom according to which the word is always used in the plural, just as in <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> there are many nouns that are wanting in the singular. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a> (Hom. iii in Hexaem.), whom <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> follows (De Fide Orth. ii), says that there are many heavens. The difference, however, is more nominal than real. For <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> means by the one <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> the whole body that is above the earth and the water, for which reason the birds that fly in the air are called birds of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> [<a href="../bible/psa008.htm#verse9">Psalm 8:9</a>. But since in this body there are many distinct parts, <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a> said that there are more heavens than one.

<p>In order, then, to understand the distinction of heavens, it must be borne in mind that <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> speaks of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> in a threefold sense. Sometimes it uses the word in its proper and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> meaning, when it denotes that body on high which is luminous actually or <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a>, and incorruptible by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. In this body there are three heavens; the first is the empyrean, which is wholly luminous; the second is the aqueous or crystalline, wholly transparent; and the third is called the starry <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, in part transparent, and in part actually luminous, and divided into eight spheres. One of these is the sphere of the fixed stars; the other seven, which may be called the seven heavens, are the spheres of the planets.

<p>In the second place, the name <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is applied to a body that participates in any property of the heavenly body, as sublimity and luminosity, actual or <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a>. Thus <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. ii) holds as one <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> all the space between the waters and the moon's orb, calling it the aerial. According to him, then, there are three heavens, the aerial, the starry, and one higher than both these, of which the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> is understood to speak when he says of himself that he was "<a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapt</a> to the third <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>."

<p>But since this space contains two elements, namely, fire and air, and in each of these there is what is called a higher and a lower region <a href="../cathen/12617a.htm">Rabanus</a> subdivides this space into four distinct heavens. The higher region of fire he calls the fiery <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>; the lower, the Olympian <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> from a lofty mountain of that name: the higher region of air he calls, from its brightness, the ethereal <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>; the lower, the aerial. When, therefore, these four heavens are added to the three enumerated above, there are seven corporeal heavens in all, in the opinion of <a href="../cathen/12617a.htm">Rabanus</a>.

<p>Thirdly, there are metaphorical uses of the word <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, as when this name is applied to the Blessed <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, Who is the Light and the Most High Spirit. It is explained by some, as thus applied, in the words, "I will ascend into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>"; whereby the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spirit is represented as seeking to make himself equal with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Sometimes also <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> blessings, the recompense of the Saints, from being the highest of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, are signified by the word <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and, in fact, are so signified, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Serm. Dom. in Monte), in the words, "Your reward is very great in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>" (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse12">Matthew 5:12</a>).

<p>Again, three kinds of <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> visions, bodily, imaginative, and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, are called sometimes so many heavens, in reference to which <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. xii) expounds <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a> "to the third <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The earth stands in relation to the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> as the centre of a circle to its circumference. But as one center may have many circumferences, so, though there is but one earth, there may be many heavens.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The argument holds good as to the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, in so far as it denotes the entire sum of corporeal creation, for in that sense it is one.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> All the heavens have in common sublimity and some degree of luminosity, as appears from what has been said.
