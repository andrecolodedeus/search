<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether all are bound to receive Baptism?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that not all are bound to receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not narrow <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> road to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. But before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> coming men could be saved without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>: therefore also after <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> coming.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> seems to have been instituted principally as a remedy for <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. Now, since a man who is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> is without <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, it seems that he cannot transmit it to his children. Therefore it seems that the children of those who have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, should not themselves be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is given in order that a man may, through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, be cleansed from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But those who are sanctified in the womb, obtain this without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Therefore they are not bound to receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse5">John 3:5</a>): "Unless a man be born again of water and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, he cannot enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>." Again it is stated in De Eccl. Dogm. xli, that "we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the way of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to be open to those only who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Men are bound to that without which they cannot obtain <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Now it is manifest that no one can obtain <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> but through Christ; wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse18">Romans 5:18</a>): "As by the offense of one unto all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> unto condemnation; so also by the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of one, unto all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> unto justification of life." But for this end is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> conferred on a man, that being regenerated thereby, he may be incorporated in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by becoming His member: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse27">Galatians 3:27</a>): "As many of you as have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, have put on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." Consequently it is manifest that all are bound to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>: and that without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> there is no <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> for men.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> At no time, not even before the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, could men be saved unless they became members of Christ: because, as it is written (<a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse12">Acts 4:12</a>), "there is no other name under <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> given to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, whereby we must be saved." But before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> coming, men were incorporated in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in His future coming: of which <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was the "seal," as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> calls it (<a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse11">Romans 4:11</a>): whereas before <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was instituted, men were incorporated in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone," as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. iv), together with the offering of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, by means of which the Fathers of old made profession of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Again, since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> coming, men are incorporated in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; according to <a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse17">Ephesians 3:17</a>: "That <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> may dwell by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in your hearts." But <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in a thing already present is manifested by a sign different from that by which it was manifested when that thing was yet in the future: just as we use other parts of the verb, to signify the present, the past, and the future. Consequently although the sacrament itself of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> was not always <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, yet <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, of which <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, was always <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As we have stated in I-II, 81, 3, ad 2, those who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> are renewed in spirit by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, while their body remains subject to the oldness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse10">Romans 8:10</a>: "The body, indeed, is dead because of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but the spirit liveth because of <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>." Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Contra Julian. vi) proves that "not everything that is in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>." Now it is manifest that in carnal generation <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not beget in respect of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but in respect of his body. Consequently the children of those who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> are born with <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>; wherefore they need to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Those who are sanctified in the womb, receive indeed <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which cleanses them from <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, but they do not therefore receive the character, by which they are conformed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Consequently, if any were to be sanctified in the womb now, they would need to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, in order to be conformed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> other members by receiving the character.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether a man can be saved without Baptism?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can be saved without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse5">John 3:5</a>): "Unless a man be born again of water and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, he cannot enter the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>." But those alone are saved who enter <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> kingdom. Therefore none can be saved without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, by which a man is born again of water and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in the book De Eccl. Dogm. xli, it is written: "We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that no <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumen</a>, though he die in his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works, will have <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, except he suffer <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, which contains all the sacramental <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>." But if it were possible for anyone to be saved without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, this would be the case specially with catechumens who are credited with <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works, for they seem to have the "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that worketh by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>" (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse6">Galatians 5:6</a>). Therefore it seems that none can be saved without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as stated above (1; 65, 4), the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Now that is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> "without which something cannot be" (Metaph. v). Therefore it seems that none can obtain <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Super Levit. lxxxiv) that "some have received the invisible sanctification without visible <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and to their profit; but though it is possible to have the visible sanctification, consisting in a visible sacrament, without the invisible sanctification, it will be to no profit." Since, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> pertains to the visible sanctification, it seems that a man can obtain <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> without the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a>, by means of the invisible sanctification.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The sacrament or <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> may be wanting to someone in two ways. First, both in reality and in desire; as is the case with those who neither are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, nor wished to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>: which clearly indicates contempt of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, in regard to those who have the use of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. Consequently those to whom <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is wanting thus, cannot obtain <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: since neither sacramentally nor <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mentally</a> are they incorporated in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, through Whom alone can <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> be obtained.

<p>Secondly, the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> may be wanting to anyone in reality but not in desire: for instance, when a man wishes to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, but by some ill-chance he is forestalled by death before receiving <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. And such a man can obtain <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> without being actually <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, on account of his desire for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, which desire is the outcome of "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that worketh by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>," whereby <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Whose power is not tied to visible <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, sanctifies <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> inwardly. Hence <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says of Valentinian, who died while yet a <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumen</a>: "I lost him whom I was to regenerate: but he did not lose the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As it is written (<a href="../bible/1sa016.htm#verse7">1 Samuel 16:7</a>), "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> seeth those things that appear, but the Lord beholdeth the heart." Now a man who desires to be "born again of water and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>" by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, is regenerated in heart though not in body. thus the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse29">Romans 2:29</a>) that "the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> is that of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter; whose praise is not of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> but of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> obtains <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> unless he be free from all guilt and debt of punishment. Now this plenary <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> is given when a man receives <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, or suffers <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>: for which reason is it stated that <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> "contains all the sacramental <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>," i.e. as to the full deliverance from guilt and punishment. Suppose, therefore, a <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumen</a> to have the desire for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> (else he could not be said to die in his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works, which cannot be without "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that worketh by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>"), such a one, were he to die, would not forthwith come to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, but would suffer punishment for his past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, "but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire" as is stated <a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse15">1 Corinthians 3:15</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> is said to be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in so far as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot be saved without, at least, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of desire; "which, with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, counts for the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>" (Augustine, Enarr. in Ps. 57).

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether Baptism should be deferred?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> should be deferred. For Pope Leo says (Epist. xvi): "Two seasons," i.e. <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> and Whitsuntide, "are fixed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a> for the celebration of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Wherefore we admonish your Beatitude not to add any other days to this custom." Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> should be conferred not at once, but delayed until the aforesaid seasons.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, we read in the decrees of the Council of Agde (Can. xxxiv): "If <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> whose bad <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> often "returns to the vomit," wish to submit to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Church, let them for eight months enter the porch of the church with the catechumens; and if they are found to come in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> then at last they may deserve the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>." Therefore men should not be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> at once, and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> should be deferred for a certain fixed time.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as we read in <a href="../bible/isa027.htm#verse9">Isaiah 27:9</a>, "this is all the fruit, that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> . . . should be taken away." Now <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> seems to be taken away, or at any rate lessened, if <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> be deferred. First, because those who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> more grievously, according to <a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse29">Hebrews 10:29</a>: "How much more, do you think, he deserveth worse punishments, who hath . . . esteemed the blood of the testament," i.e. <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, "<a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>, by which he was sanctified?" Secondly, because <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> takes away past, but not future, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: wherefore the more it is deferred, the more <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> it takes away. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> should be deferred for a long time.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/sir005.htm#verse8">Sirach 5:8</a>): "Delay not to be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to the Lord, and defer it not from day to day." But the perfect conversion to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is of those who are regenerated in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> should not be deferred from day to day.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In this matter we must make a distinction and see whether those who are to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> are children or adults. For if they be children, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> should not be deferred. First, because in them we do not look for better instruction or fuller conversion. Secondly, because of the danger of death, for no other remedy is available for them besides the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a>.

<p>On the other hand, adults have a remedy in the mere desire for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). And therefore <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> should not be conferred on adults as soon as they are <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>, but it should be deferred until some fixed time. First, as a safeguard to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, lest she be deceived through <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> those who come to her under <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> pretenses, according to <a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse1">1 John 4:1</a>: "Believe not every spirit, but try the spirits, if they be of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." And those who approach <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> are put to this test, when their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and morals are subjected to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> for a space of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Secondly, this is needful as being useful for those who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; for they require a certain space of time in order to be fully instructed in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and to be drilled in those things that pertain to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> mode of life. Thirdly, a certain reverence for the sacrament demands a delay whereby men are admitted to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> at the principal festivities, viz. of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> and Pentecost, the result being that they receive the sacrament with greater devotion.

<p>There are, however, two reasons for forgoing this delay. First, when those who are to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> appear to be perfectly instructed in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and ready for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>; thus, Philip <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> the Eunuch at once (<a href="../bible/act008.htm">Acts 8</a>); and Peter, Cornelius and those who were with him (<a href="../bible/act010.htm">Acts 10</a>). Secondly, by reason of sickness or some kind of danger of death. Wherefore Pope Leo says (Epist. xvi): "Those who are threatened by death, sickness, siege, <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, or shipwreck, should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> at any time." Yet if a man is forestalled by death, so as to have no time to receive the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, while he awaits the season appointed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he is saved, yet "so as by fire," as stated above (2, ad 2). Nevertheless he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> if he defer being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> beyond the time appointed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, except this be for an unavoidable <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and with the permission of the authorities of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But even this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, with his other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, can be washed away by his subsequent <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, which takes the place of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, as stated above (Question 66, Article 11).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This decree of Pope Leo, concerning the celebration of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> at two seasons, is to be understood "with the exception of the danger of death" (which is always to be feared in children) as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This decree concerning the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> was for a safeguard to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, lest they corrupt the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of simple people, if they be not fully converted. Nevertheless, as the same passage reads further on, "if within the appointed time they are threatened with danger of sickness, they should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which it bestows, removes not only past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but hinders the commission of future <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Now this is the point to be considered--that men may not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: it is a secondary consideration that their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> be less grievous, or that their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> be washed away, according to <a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse1">1 John 2:1-2</a>: "My little children, these things I write to you, that you may not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we have an advocate with the Father, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> the just; and He is the propitiation for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>."

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether sinners should be baptized?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that sinners should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/zec013.htm#verse1">Zechariah 13:1</a>): "In that day there shall be a fountain open to the House of David, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem: for the washing of the sinner and of the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>": and this is to be understood of the fountain of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> should be offered even to sinners.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse12">Matthew 9:12</a>): "They that are in health need not a physician, but they that are ill." But they that are ill are sinners. Therefore since <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is the remedy of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the physician of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, it seems that this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> should be offered to sinners.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no assistance should be withdrawn from sinners. But sinners who have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> derive <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> assistance from the very character of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, since it is a disposition to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> should be offered to sinners.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Serm. clxix): "He Who <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> thee without thee, will not justify thee without thee." But since a sinner's <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is ill-disposed, he does not co-operate with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore it is useless to employ <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> as a means of <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may be said to be a sinner in two ways. First, on account of the stain and the debt of punishment incurred in the past: and on sinners in this sense the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> should be conferred, since it is instituted specially for this purpose, that by it the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may be washed away, according to <a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse26">Ephesians 5:26</a>: "Cleansing it by the laver of water in the word of life."

<p>Secondly, a man may be called a sinner because he wills to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and purposes to remain in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and on sinners in this sense the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> should not be conferred. First, indeed, because by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> men are incorporated in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to <a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse27">Galatians 3:27</a>: "As many of you as have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, have put on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." Now so long as a man wills to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he cannot be united to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to <a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse14">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>: "What participation hath <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> with <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>?" Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in his book on Penance (Serm. cccli) that "no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who has the use of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> can begin the new life, except he repent of his former life." Secondly, because there should be nothing useless in the works of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Now that is useless which does not reach the end to which it is ordained; and, on the other hand, no one having the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can, at the same time, be cleansed from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is the purpose of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>; for this would be to combine two contradictory things. Thirdly, because there should be no falsehood in the sacramental signs. Now a sign is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> if it does not correspond with the thing signified. But the very fact that a man presents himself to be cleansed by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, signifies that he prepares himself for the inward cleansing: while this cannot be the case with one who purposes to remain in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore it is manifest that on such a man the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> is not to be conferred.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The words quoted are to be understood of those sinners whose <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is set on renouncing <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The physician of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, i.e. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, works in two ways. First, inwardly, by Himself: and thus He prepares <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will so that it wills <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Secondly, He works through ministers, by the outward application of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>: and in this way His work consists in perfecting what was begun outwardly. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> is not to be conferred save on those in whom there appears some sign of their interior conversion: just as neither is bodily medicine given to a sick <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, unless he show some sign of life.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Now dead <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> does not suffice for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; nor is it the foundation, but living <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone, "that worketh by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>" (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse6">Galatians 5:6</a>), as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Fide et oper.). Neither, therefore, can the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> give <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to a man whose <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is set on <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, and hence expels the form of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Moreover, the impression of the baptismal character cannot dispose a man for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> as long as he retains the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> compels no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>," as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii).

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether works of satisfaction should be enjoined on sinners that have been baptized?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that works of satisfaction should be enjoined on sinners that have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> seems to demand that a man should be punished for every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of his, according to <a href="../bible/ecc012.htm#verse14">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>: "All things that are done, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will bring into judgment." But works of satisfaction are enjoined on sinners in punishment of past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore it seems that works of satisfaction should be enjoined on sinners that have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, by means of works of satisfaction sinners recently converted are drilled into righteousness, and are made to avoid the occasions of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: "for satisfaction consists in extirpating the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, and closing the doors to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>" (De Eccl. Dogm. iv). But this is most <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in the case of those who have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> recently. Therefore it seems that works of satisfaction should be enjoined on sinners.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> owes satisfaction to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> not less than to his neighbor. But if those who were recently <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> have injured their neighbor, they should be told to make reparation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by works of penance.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse29">Romans 11:29</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> and the calling of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are without repentance," says: "The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> requires neither sighs nor groans in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, nor indeed any work at all, but <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone; and remits all, gratis."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse3">Romans 6:3-4</a>), "all we who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in His death: for we are buried together with Him, by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> unto death"; which is to say that by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is incorporated in the very death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Now it is manifest from what has been said above (48, 2,4; 49, 3) that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death satisfied sufficiently for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, "not for ours only, but also for those of the whole world," according to <a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse2">1 John 2:2</a>. Consequently no kind of satisfaction should be enjoined on one who is being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, for any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> whatever: and this would be to dishonor the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> and death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as being insufficient for the plenary satisfaction for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of those who were to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in his book on Infant <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> (De Pecc. Merit. et Remiss. i), "the effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is to make those, who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, to be incorporated in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as His members." Wherefore the very pains of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> were satisfactory for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of those who were to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; just as the pain of one member can be satisfactory for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of another member. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse4">Isaiah 53:4</a>): "Surely He hath borne our infirmities and carried our sorrows."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Those who have been lately <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> should be drilled into righteousness, not by penal, but by "easy works, so as to advance to perfection by taking exercise, as infants by taking milk," as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says on <a href="../bible/psa130.htm#verse2">Psalm 130:2</a>: "As a child that is weaned is towards his mother." For this reason did <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> excuse His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> from <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> when they were recently <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>, as we read in <a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse14">Matthew 9:14-15</a>: and the same is written <a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse2">1 Peter 2:2</a>: "As new-born babes desire . . . milk . . . that thereby you may grow unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> To restore what has been ill taken from one's neighbor, and to make satisfaction for wrong done to him, is to cease from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: for the very fact of retaining what belongs to another and of not being reconciled to one's neighbor, is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Wherefore those who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> should be enjoined to make satisfaction to their neighbor, as also to desist from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But they are not to be enjoined to suffer any punishment for past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether sinners who are going to be baptized are bound to confess their sins?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that sinners who are going to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> are bound to confess their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse6">Matthew 3:6</a>) that many "were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>" by John "in the Jordan confessing their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is more perfect than John's. Therefore it seems that there is yet greater reason why they who are about to receive <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> should confess their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/pro028.htm#verse13">Proverbs 28:13</a>): "He that hideth his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, shall not prosper; but he that shall confess and forsake them, shall obtain mercy." Now for this is a man <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, that he may obtain mercy for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore those who are going to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> should confess their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, Penance is required before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, according to <a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse38">Acts 2:38</a>: "Do penance and be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> every one of you." But confession is a part of Penance. Therefore it seems that confession of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> should take place before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Confession of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> should be sorrowful: thus <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Vera et Falsa Poenit. xiv): "All these circumstances should be taken into account and deplored." Now, as <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says on <a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse29">Romans 11:29</a>, "the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> requires neither sighs nor groans in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>." Therefore confession of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> should not be required of those who are going to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Confession of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is twofold. One is made inwardly to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and such confession of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is required before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>: in other words, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should call his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to mind and sorrow for them; since "he cannot begin the new life, except he repent of his former life," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in his book on Penance (Serm. cccli). The other is the outward confession of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which is made to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>; and such confession is not required before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. First, because this confession, since it is directed to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the minister, belongs to the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a>, which is not required before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, which is the door of all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Secondly, because the reason why a man makes outward confession to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, is that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> may <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> him from his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and bind him to works of satisfaction, which should not be enjoined on the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, as stated above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>). Moreover those who are being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> do not need to be released from their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by the keys of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, since all are forgiven them in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Thirdly, because the very act of confession made to a man is penal, by reason of the shame it inflicts on the one confessing: whereas no exterior punishment is enjoined on a man who is being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.

<p>Therefore no special confession of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is required of those who are being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; but that general confession suffices which they make when in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> ritual they "renounce Satan and all his works." And in this sense a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> explains <a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse6">Matthew 3:6</a>, saying that in John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> "those who are going to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> learn that they should confess their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and promise to amend their life."

<p>If, however, any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> about to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, wish, out of devotion, to confess their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, their confession should be heard; not for the purpose of enjoining them to do satisfaction, but in order to instruct them in the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life as a remedy against their <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">Sins</a> were not forgiven in John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, which, however, was the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of Penance. Consequently it was fitting that those who went to receive that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, should confess their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, so that they should receive a penance in proportion to their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is without outward penance, as <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (on <a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse29">Romans 11:29</a>); and therefore there is no comparison.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is enough that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> make inward confession to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and also an outward general confession, for them to "prosper and obtain mercy": and they need no special outward confession, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Confession is a part of sacramental Penance, which is not required before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, as stated above: but the inward <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of Penance is required.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the intention of receiving the sacrament of Baptism is required on the part of the one baptized?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of receiving the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> is not required on the part of the one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. For the one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> is, as it were, "patient" in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. But an <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is required not on the part of the patient but on the part of the agent. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of receiving <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is not required on the part of the one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if what is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> be omitted, the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> must be repeated; for instance, if the invocation of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> be omitted, as stated above (66, 9, ad 3). But it does not seem that a man should be rebaptized through not having had the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of receiving <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>: else, since his <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, anyone might ask to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again on account of his lack of <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>. Therefore it seems that no <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is required on the part of the one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, in order that he receive the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is given as a remedy for <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. But <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is contracted without the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> born. Therefore, seemingly, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> requires no <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> on the part of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> ritual, those who are to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> ask of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that they may receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>: and thus they express their <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of receiving the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> By <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> a man dies to the old life of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and begins a certain newness of life, according to <a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse4">Romans 6:4</a>: "We are buried together with" <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> "by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> into death; that, as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is risen from the dead . . . so we also may walk in newness of life." Consequently, just as, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Serm. cccli), he who has the use of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, must, in order to die to the old life, "will to repent of his former life"; so must he, of his own will, intend to lead a new life, the beginning of which is precisely the receiving of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Therefore on the part of the one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for him to have the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> or <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of receiving the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> When a man is justified by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, his passiveness is not <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> but <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>: wherefore it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for him to intend to receive that which is given him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> If an adult lack the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of receiving the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, he must be rebaptized. But if there be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about this, the form to be used should be: "If thou art not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, I <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> thee."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is a remedy not only against original, but also against actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by our will and <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether faith is required on the part of the one baptized?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is required on the part of the one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> was instituted by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in giving the form of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, makes <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to precede <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> (<a href="../bible/mar016.htm#verse16">Mark 16:16</a>): "He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> and is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, shall be saved." Therefore it seems that without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> there can be no <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, nothing useless is done in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But according to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> ritual, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who comes to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> is asked concerning his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: "Dost thou <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father Almighty?" Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is required for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of receiving the sacrament is required for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. But this cannot be without right <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, since <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is the sacrament of right <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: for thereby men "are incorporated in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in his book on Infant <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> (De Pecc. Merit. et Remiss. i); and this cannot be without right <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, according to <a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse17">Ephesians 3:17</a>: "That <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> may dwell by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in your hearts." Therefore it seems that a man who has not right <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> cannot receive the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, unbelief is a most grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as we have shown in the II-II, 10, 3. But those who remain in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> should not be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>: therefore neither should those who remain in unbelief.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> writing to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Quiricus says: "We have learned from the ancient tradition of the Fathers that when <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, come back to Holy Church, they are to be welcomed to her bosom, either with the anointing of <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>, or the imposition of hands, or the mere profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>." But such would not be the case if <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> were <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for a man to receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As appears from what has been said above (63, 6; 66, 9) <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> produces a twofold effect in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, viz. the character and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore in two ways may a thing be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. First, as something without which <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which is the ultimate effect of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, cannot be had. And thus right <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, because, as it appears from <a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse22">Romans 3:22</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.

<p>Secondly, something is required of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, because without it the baptismal character cannot be imprinted And thus right <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in the one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> any more than in the one who baptizes: provided the other <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> are fulfilled which are <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. For the sacrament is not perfected by the righteousness of the minister or of the recipient of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, but by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> is speaking there of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> as bringing us to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by giving us <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>: which of course cannot be without right <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: wherefore He says pointedly: "He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> and is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, shall be saved."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The Church's <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> in Baptizing men is that they may be cleansed from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/isa027.htm#verse9">Isaiah 27:9</a>: "This is all the fruit, that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> . . . should be taken away." And therefore, as far as she is concerned, she does not intend to give <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> save to those who have right <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, without which there is no remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. And for this reason she asks those who come to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> whether they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. If, on the contrary, anyone, without right <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he does not receive it unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Baptism. contr. Donat. iv): "From the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> being compared to Paradise we learn that men can receive her <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> even outside her fold, but that elsewhere none can receive or keep the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the blessed."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Even he who has not right <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> on other points, can have right <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> about the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a>: and so he is not hindered from having the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of receiving that sacrament. Yet even if he think not aright concerning this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, it is enough, for the receiving of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, that he should have a general <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of receiving <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, according as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> instituted, and as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> bestows it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Just as the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> is not to be conferred on a man who is unwilling to give up his other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, so neither should it be given to one who is unwilling to renounce his unbelief. Yet each receives the sacrament if it be conferred on him, though not unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether children should be baptized?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that children should not be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> to receive the sacrament is required in one who is being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, as stated above (<a href="#7">Article 7</a>). But children cannot have such an <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, since they have not the use of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. Therefore it seems that they cannot receive the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as stated above (39, 5; 66, 1, ad 1). But children have not <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which demands an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> on the part of the believer, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Super Joan. xxvi). Nor can it be said that their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is implied in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of their parents; since the latter are sometimes unbelievers, and their unbelief would conduce rather to the damnation of their children. Therefore it seems that children cannot be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/1pe003.htm#verse21">1 Peter 3:21</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> saveth" men; "not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the examination of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." But children have no <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, either <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or bad, since they have not the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>: nor can they be fittingly examined, since they understand not. Therefore children should not be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. iii): "Our heavenly guides," i.e. the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostles</a>, "approved of infants being admitted to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse17">Romans 5:17</a>), "if by one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> offense death reigned through one," namely <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, "much more they who receive abundance of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, shall reign in life through one, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>." Now children contract <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>; which is made clear by the fact that they are under the ban of death, which "passed upon all" on account of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says in the same passage (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse12">Romans 5:12</a>). Much more, therefore, can children receive <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, so as to reign in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> Himself said (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse5">John 3:5</a>): "Unless a man be born again of water and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, he cannot enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>." Consequently it became <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> children, that, as in birth they incurred damnation through <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> so in a second birth they might obtain <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Moreover it was fitting that children should receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, in order that being reared from childhood in things pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> mode of life, they may the more easily persevere therein; according to <a href="../bible/pro022.htm#verse5">Proverbs 22:5</a>: "A young <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> according to his way, even when he is old, he will not depart from it." This reason is also given by <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Eccl. Hier. iii).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> regeneration effected by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is somewhat like carnal birth, in this respect, that as the child while in the mother's womb receives nourishment not independently, but through the nourishment of its mother, so also children before the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, being as it were in the womb of their mother the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, receive <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> not by their own act, but by the act of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Pecc. Merit. et Remiss. i): "The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, our mother, offers her maternal mouth for her children, that they may imbibe the sacred mysteries: for they cannot as yet with their own hearts <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> unto <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, nor with their own mouths confess unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> . . . And if they are rightly said to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, because in a certain fashion they make profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by the words of their sponsors, why should they not also be said to repent, since by the words of those same sponsors they evidence their renunciation of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and this world?" For the same reason they can be said to intend, not by their own act of <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, since at times they struggle and cry; but by the act of those who bring them to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says, writing to Boniface (Cont. duas Ep. Pelag. i), "in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of our Saviour little children <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> through others, just as they contracted from others those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are remitted in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>." Nor is it a hindrance to their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> if their parents be unbelievers, because, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says, writing to the same Boniface (Ep. xcviii), "little children are offered that they may receive <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, not so much from the hands of those that carry them (yet from these too, if they be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and faithful) as from the whole company of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and the faithful. For they are rightly considered to be offered by those who are pleased at their being offered, and by whose <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> they are united in communion with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." And the unbelief of their own parents, even if after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> these strive to infect them with the worship of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, hurts not the children. For as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Cont. duas Ep. Pelag. i) "when once the child has been begotten by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of others, he cannot subsequently be held by the bonds of another's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> so long as he consent not with his will, according to" <a href="../bible/eze018.htm#verse4">Ezekiel 18:4</a>: "'As the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the Father, so also the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the son is mine; the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinneth</a>, the same shall die.' Yet he contracted from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> that which was loosed by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, because as yet he was not endowed with a separate <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of one, indeed of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, profits the child through the operation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, Who unites the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> together, and communicates the goods of one member to another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Just as a child, when he is being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> not by himself but by others, so is he examined not by himself but through others, and these in answer confess the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the child's stead, who is aggregated to this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. And the child acquires a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> in himself, not indeed as to the act, but as to the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, by <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>.

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether children of Jews or other unbelievers be baptized against the will of their parents?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that children of <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> or other unbelievers should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of their parents. For it is a matter of greater urgency to rescue a man from the danger of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> death than from the danger of temporal death. But one ought to rescue a child that is threatened by the danger of temporal death, even if its parents through <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> try to prevent its being rescued. Therefore much more reason is there for rescuing the children of unbelievers from the danger of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> death, even against their parents' will.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> The children of slaves are themselves slaves, and in the power of their masters. But <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> and all other unbelievers are the slaves of kings and rulers. Therefore without any <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> rulers can have the children of <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, as well as those of other slaves who are unbelievers.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> belongs more to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from Whom he has his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, than to his carnal father, from whom he has his body. Therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> if the children of unbelievers are taken away from their carnal parents, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written in the Decretals (Dist. xlv), quoting the council of Toledo: "In regard to the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod commands that henceforward none of them be forced to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>: for such are not to be saved against their will, but willingly, that their righteousness may be without flaw."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The children of unbelievers either have the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> or they have not. If they have, then they already begin to control their own actions, in things that are of Divine or <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>. And therefore of their own accord, and against the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of their parents, they can receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, just as they can contract marriage. Consequently such can lawfully be advised and persuaded to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.

<p>If, however, they have not yet the use of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> they are under the care of their parents as long as they cannot look after themselves. For which reason we say that even the children of the ancients "were saved through the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of their parents." Wherefore it would be contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> if such children were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> against their parents' will; just as it would be if one having the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> against his will. Moreover under the circumstances it would be dangerous to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> the children of unbelievers; for they would be liable to lapse into unbelief, by reason of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> affection for their parents. Therefore it is not the custom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> the children of unbelievers against their parents' will.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is not right to rescue a man from death of the body against the order of <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>: for instance, if a man be condemned to death by the judge who has tried him, none should use force in order to rescue him from death. Consequently, neither should anyone infringe the order of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, in virtue of which a child is under the care of its father, in order to rescue it from the danger of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> death.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> are slaves of rulers by civil slavery, which does not exclude the order of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> is ordained unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, by which he can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore a child, before it has the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, is ordained to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order, through the reason of its parents, under whose care it <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> lies, and it is according to their ordering that things pertaining to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are to be done in respect of the child.

<h2 id="article11">Article 11. Whether a child can be baptized while yet in its mother's womb?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that a child can be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> while yet in its mother's womb. For the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is more efficacious unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> than <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> unto condemnation, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse15">Romans 5:15</a>). But a child while yet in its mother's womb is under sentence of condemnation on account of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For much more reason, therefore, can it be saved through the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which is bestowed by means of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Therefore a child can be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> while yet in its mother's womb.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a child, while yet in its mother's womb, seems to be part of its mother. Now, when the mother is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, whatever is in her and part of her, is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. Therefore it seems that when the mother is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, the child in her womb is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> death is a greater <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> than death of the body. But of two <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> the less should be chosen. If, therefore, the child in the mother's womb cannot be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, it would be better for the mother to be opened, and the child to be taken out by force and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, than that the child should be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> damned through dying without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it happens at times that some part of the child comes forth first, as we read in <a href="../bible/gen038.htm#verse27">Genesis 38:27</a>: "In the very delivery of the infants, one put forth a hand, whereon the midwife tied a scarlet thread, saying: This shall come forth the first. But he drawing back his hand, the other came forth." Now sometimes in such cases there is danger of death. Therefore it seems that that part should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, while the child is yet in its mother's womb.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. ad Dardan.): "No one can be born a second time unless he be born first." But <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> regeneration. Therefore no one should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> before he is born from the womb.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> that some part of the body of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> be in some way washed with water, since <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is a kind of washing, as stated above (Question 66, Article 1). But an infant's body, before being born from the womb, can nowise be washed with water; unless perchance it be said that the baptismal water, with which the mother's body is washed, reaches the child while yet in its mother's womb. But this is impossible: both because the child's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, to the sanctification of which <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is ordained, is distinct from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the mother; and because the body of the animated infant is already formed, and consequently distinct from the body of the mother. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> which the mother receives does not overflow on to the child which is in her womb. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Cont. Julian. vi): "If what is conceived within a mother belonged to her body, so as to be considered a part thereof, we should not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> an infant whose mother, through danger of death, was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> while she bore it in her womb. Since, then, it," i.e. the infant, "is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, it certainly did not belong to the mother's body while it was in the womb." It follows, therefore, that a child can nowise be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> while in its mother's womb.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Children while in the mother's womb have not yet come forth into the world to live among other men. Consequently they cannot be subject to the action of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, so as to receive the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, at the hands of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. They can, however, be subject to the action of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in Whose sight they live, so as, by a kind of privilege, to receive the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of sanctification; as was the case with those who were sanctified in the womb.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> An internal member of the mother is something of hers by continuity and material union of the part with the whole: whereas a child while in its mother's womb is something of hers through being joined with, and yet distinct from her. Wherefore there is no comparison.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> We should "not do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that there may come <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse8">Romans 3:8</a>). Therefore it is wrong to kill a mother that her child may be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. If, however, the mother die while the child lives yet in her womb, she should be opened that the child may be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Unless death be imminent, we should wait until the child has entirely come forth from the womb before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> it. If, however, the head, wherein the senses are rooted, appear first, it should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, in cases of danger: nor should it be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again, if perfect birth should ensue. And seemingly the same should be done in cases of danger no <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> what part of the body appear first. But as none of the exterior parts of the body belong to its integrity in the same degree as the head, some hold that since the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>, whenever any other part of the body has been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, the child, when perfect birth has taken place, should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the form: "If thou art not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, I <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> thee," etc.

<h2 id="article12">Article 12. Whether madmen and imbeciles should be baptized?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madmen</a> and imbeciles should not be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. For in order to receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> must have the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, as stated above (<a href="#7">Article 7</a>). But since <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madmen</a> and imbeciles lack the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, they can have but a disorderly <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>. Therefore they should not be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> excels irrational animals in that he has reason. But <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madmen</a> and imbeciles lack the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, indeed in some cases we do not expect them ever to have it, as we do in the case of children. It seems, therefore, that just as irrational animals are not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, so neither should <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madmen</a> and imbeciles in those cases be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> is suspended in <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madmen</a> and imbeciles more than it is in one who sleeps. But it is not customary to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> people while they sleep. Therefore it should not be given to <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madmen</a> and imbeciles.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. iv) of his friend that "he was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> when his recovery was despaired of": and yet <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> was efficacious with him. Therefore <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> should sometimes be given to those who lack the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madmen</a> and imbeciles a distinction is to be made. For some are so from birth, and have no lucid intervals, and show no signs of the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. And with regard to these it seems that we should come to the same decision as with regard to children who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as stated above (9, ad 2).

<p>But there are others who have fallen from a state of sanity into a state of insanity. And with regard to these we must be guided by their wishes as expressed by them when sane: so that, if then they manifested a desire to receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, it should be given to them when in a state of <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> or imbecility, even though then they refuse. If, on the other hand, while sane they showed no desire to receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, they must not be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.

<p>Again, there are some who, though mad or imbecile from birth, have, nevertheless, lucid intervals, in which they can make right use of reason. Wherefore, if then they express a desire for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, they can be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> though they be actually in a state of <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>. And in this case the sacrament should be bestowed on them if there be fear of danger otherwise it is better to wait until the time when they are sane, so that they may receive the sacrament more devoutly. But if during the interval of lucidity they manifest no desire to receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, they should not be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> while in a state of insanity.

<p>Lastly there are others who, though not altogether sane, yet can use their reason so far as to think about their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and understand the power of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. And these are to be treated the same as those who are sane, and who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> if they be willing, but not against their will.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Imbeciles who never had, and have not now, the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, just as according to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> ritual, they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and repent; as we have stated above of children (9, ad Objection). But those who have had the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> at some time, or have now, are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> according to their own <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, which they have now, or had when they were sane.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Madmen and imbeciles lack the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, i.e. through some impediment in a bodily organ; but not like irrational animals through want of a rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Consequently the comparison does not hold.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> should not be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> while asleep, except he be threatened with the danger of death. In which case he should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, if previously he has manifested a desire to receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, as we have stated in reference to imbeciles: thus <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> relates of his friend that "he was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> while unconscious," because he was in danger of death (Confess. iv).
